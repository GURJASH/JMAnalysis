        "Extracted Article": "Stripe has laid off 300 employees, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.The cuts mostly affected staffers in product, engineering, and operations roles, per the memo.Its chief people officer said in the memo the company still planned to grow its head count.The payments platform Stripe has laid off 300 employees, equivalent to about 3.5% of its workforce, Business Insider has learned. The company's chief people officer, Rob McIntosh, informed staff of the cuts in an email on Monday, obtained by BI. McIntosh said that 300 employees \u2014 primarily in product, engineering, and operations \u2014 would be affected by the cuts but that Stripe still planned on growing its head count to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year.Stripe confirmed the layoffs to BI. The Irish American multinational, which has dual headquarters in San Francisco and Dublin, laid off more than 1,000 employees in 2022 \u2014 equivalent to about 14% of its workforce at the time.In mid-2023, Stripe cut a few dozen roles, mostly from its recruiting department, The Information reported at the time.BI understands that Stripe had 8,500 employees before the latest rounds of layoffs. Founded in 2010 by the brothers John and Patrick Collison, Stripe provides software tools for online and in-person payment processing to millions of businesses.Read the full memo below:Hi all,As we've been working through our plans for 2025, leaders took a close look at their organizations and team structures. It became clear that there were several team-level changes needed to make sure we have the right people in the right roles and locations to execute against our plans.It's not easy to make all these changes at once, but it's even harder to have them roll out gradually throughout the year, and so we asked leaders to do all they could to pull these decisions forward. As a result, about 300 Stripes, largely in product, engineering, and operations roles, are departing today.[0] All those who are impacted have already been informed, and everyone will receive a severance package, including their earned annual bonus.I want to be clear that we're not slowing down hiring \u2014 we expect to grow headcount across all our locations and to land at about 10,000 Stripes by the end of the year (a 17% Y/Y increase). Our business performance continues to be strong.Our confidence that this is the right business decision doesn't make it easier for those who are leaving or those losing valued teammates. I appreciate everyone's resilience and want to thank those departing for their contributions and for building with us.Rob[0] There are local processes commencing for some Stripes outside the US, in accordance with country-specific employment practices.Are you a Stripe employee with insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Sword Health cut a portion of its physical therapists last month, the company confirmed to BI.The startup aims to use AI to help increase the number of patients its physical therapists care for.Sword, which hit a $3 billion valuation earlier this year, could go public as soon as 2025.Sword Health has made cuts to its clinical workforce as the $3 billion startup seeks to manage more patients with the help of AI, Business Insider has learned. Last month, the startup, which provides virtual care for conditions such as muscle and joint pain, let go of 13 of its physical therapists who were treating patients, Sword confirmed to Business Insider.Three former employees who spoke with BI on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said Sword previously had about 75 physical therapists actively caring for patients, which puts the October cuts at about 17% of Sword's treatment-facing clinicians. The layoffs come as Sword seeks to use AI to enable its physical therapists to treat more patients. Sword aims to have its physical therapists manage an average of 700 patients at any given time by the end of 2024, according to documents reviewed by BI.That's a significant jump from the caseload previously allotted to Sword's clinicians, the three former employees said, adding that a high caseload at the beginning of 2024 would've been about 200 to 300 patients per therapist. These numbers could include patients who aren't actively engaged in therapy, according to the company.In a statement to BI, a Sword spokesperson said the cuts were \"all performance-based decisions, made on clinical engagement data.\" The spokesperson said Sword has open positions for more than 30 physical therapists. Sword, which hit a $3 billion valuation in June after pulling in $130 million in fresh financing, has been vocal about its ambitions to scale its business using artificial intelligence while keeping clinicians in the loop.\"What we're looking to do internally is to have AI as one master expert, but at the same time, everything gets vetted and validated by a human person,\" Sword CEO Virg\u00edlio Bento told BI in September 2023.The three former employees said that Sword began using AI-generated messages for patient conversations in the spring. The technology allows physical therapists to accept an AI-generated message, edit it, or reject it. Once a therapist accepts or edits the message, it's sent to patients, the former employees said. The AI also helps physical therapists prioritize the most critical patients, who might need more attention, according to the company. Following its $130 million financing round, Sword announced an expansion of its AI platform with a new product that the company said could converse with patients during their virtual physical-therapy sessions and give them feedback in real time.It's also hoping to land more employer contracts with an outcomes-based pricing model, unveiled in September. In those contracts, Sword is set to get paid based on how much progress its patients make.Sword's recent technology and pricing pushes also point to an approaching initial public offering. Bento told BI in 2023 that he'd be interested in taking Sword public only if it's profitable. The startup said in June that it expected to be profitable by the end of 2024 and could go public as soon as the second half of 2025. It's not the only digital-health startup waiting at the IPO gates. Its biggest competitor, the musculoskeletal startup Hinge Health, has hired banks, including Morgan Stanley, to file its S-1 in anticipation of a public-market debut, Business Insider first reported in September.Omada Health is also expected to test the IPO waters. BI first reported last month that Omada filed its S-1 this summer."

These people asked to remain anonymous to protect business relationships. A spokesperson for PubMatic confirmed the move, saying it impacted a dozen people or about 1% of the workforce.The company stated in its financial filings that it had 948 employees, 290 of whom were located in the US, as of December 21, 2023. \"PubMatic is optimizing operations to focus on high-growth areas such as supply path optimization, CTV, and commerce media,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"By streamlining and enhancing collaboration under consolidated leadership, we will foster innovation, reduce complexity, and maintain our commitment to growth and operational excellence.\"The spokesperson added that the company had more than 50 open positions it is actively hiring for and that it plans to grow its overall head count by around 15% this year.Founded in 2006, California-based PubMatic operates what's known in the advertising industry as a supply-side platform, which helps publishers organize and sell their ad inventory in online ad auctions. It has since expanded its offering into areas like video, connected TV, retail media, and supply path optimization, which helps advertisers streamline the buying process by forming direct relationships with publishers and cutting out intermediaries.The company went public 2020 and had a market capitalization at the time of writing of about $730 million.PubMatic's stock took a dive when the company reported its most recent quarterly earnings in August. While revenue grew 6% and gross profit grew 10% year-over-year, the company revised down its full-year revenue guidance after one of its demand-side platform partners, in May, changed the way it bid on advertising auctions. AdExchanger later reported the DSP was Google's DV360. PubMatic also said in August that its outlook assumed \"continued softness from certain ad verticals,\" which included sectors such as technology, automotive, travel, and entertainment. However, the company's chief financial officer, Steve Pantelick, described the weakness as an \"air pocket\" that wouldn't significantly impact the remainder of the year.The company's stock price is down around 8% year to date."

But despite its outsize place in the cultural conversation, Goop has struggled to define itself over the past decade and a half, and it looks like it's still having trouble.Goop is cutting 18% of its 216-person staff, citing a change to its organization, WWD reported on Thursday. It'll focus on beauty, fashion, and food \u2014&nbsp;specifically its Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop beauty brands, its G. Label clothing line, and Goop Kitchen restaurants. That means it's moving away from wellness, home, travel, and sexual wellness, some of which are&nbsp;categories that once defined the brand.Goop started out as a newsletter of Paltrow's favorite things before becoming a website and then a mini-empire.Ten years into its run, in 2018, it raised $50 million in a Series C round;&nbsp;it has raised a total of $134.5 million and was last valued at $433 million in 2020, per PitchBook. At the time, it was largely a media and e-commerce company, shilling alternative health products like jade vaginal eggs as well as its own line of supplements, signing deals with media giants like Cond\u00e9 Nast, and hosting summits that could cost thousands of dollars to attend. Throughout its many iterations, it also had a Netflix series, a line of home goods, and its own publishing imprint.Recently, it has doubled down on beauty and food.Over the summer, Goop opened its first store to offer in-store treatments. Last year, it launched Good Clean Goop, a lower-priced line of skincare that can be found in Target and on Amazon. (An exfoliator from the brand costs $20, while one from Goop Beauty costs $125.) Puck reported in June that the lower-priced line was in the \"'bottom 15' at Target.\" Neil Saunders, a managing director at GlobalDatal Retail, told Business Insider that while being in Target had increased the brand's exposure, \"more needs to be done by Goop to really cut through, especially with younger consumers.\"Goop Kitchen \u2014 a ghost kitchen, or delivery-only restaurant \u2014 was founded in 2021. It has several locations in Southern California and recently raised $15 million from investors like Travis Kalanick, the Uber cofounder and CloudKitchens CEO, at a $105 million valuation, according to PitchBook.Goop's many pivots have not been without internal turmoil. In 2021, BI reported that at least 140 employees, including executives, had left the company over two years, with some saying they felt underpaid. \"Leadership training is where I'd be spending all my time,\" a former employee told BI at the time. \"Sometimes, when you have founders who are also CEOs, that passion can be a blind spot.\"While the brand has had three CEOs since its inception, Paltrow has been its chief executive since 2017.The brand told WWD that its revenue was up last year over 2022 and was on track to increase again this year, though it didn't provide any numbers.

The startup, founded by Kel Rakowski and Jennifer Rhiannon Lewis in 2019, was originally launched as a dating app for LGBTQ+ users and was inspired by magazine-era personal dating ads. The app pivoted to more community-focused features last year and Lewis replaced Rakowski as CEO.\"We're committed to building Lex to be a thriving social app for LGBTQ+ community,\" Lewis said in a written statement. \"It's an invaluable tool used by 1 million people to date to express their full queer identity, safe from harassment of mainstream social, cultivate connections with local gays in their neighborhood and find queer resources.\" Lex had raised a total of $7 million in funding, the company told Business Insider earlier this year. The full-time team was about eight staffers, according to a comment on the platform's Instagram account.Like many other newer social-media platforms, Lex has been experimenting with ways to monetize its product. The app offers premium features \u2014 such as changing your location or the ability to post several times a month \u2014 that users can unlock with one-time purchases. It also has a program for queer-owned businesses to advertise on its platform.In June, Lex announced its \"Team Gay Agenda\" campaign to raise funds from its users via recurring monthly pledges and told users that the \"Lex community is at risk.\" The layoffs occurred at the end of June.\"With the well documented demise of queer spaces, our number one priority will always be making sure our community has space to thrive on Lex,\" Lewis added. \"The layoffs allow us to explore more possibilities to achieve that vision. We're currently in active conversations with other parties who share our commitment to accelerate this community's growth.\"The platform is not shutting down and two laid-off staffers told BI that they hope to see the platform survive. \"I believe in the app,\" said one laid-off staffer who requested anonymity to protect career prospects.The queer community is growing, but new social apps face an uphill climbLex services a small but growing community: A Gallup poll found that in 2012, just 3.5% of Americans considered themselves non-heterosexual; in 2020 \u2014 just after the time of Lex's founding \u2014 that figure grew to 5.6%. And, as of 2023, 7.6% of Americans identified as non-heterosexual. That increase has been driven by younger generations \u2014 including over a fifth of Gen Z \u2014 identifying as LGBTQ+.Business Insider's analysis of individual-level Household Pulse Survey data from April 2024 found that just around a third of gay and lesbian adults are married, compared to 58% of straight adults \u2014 another potential boon for dating-based platforms. Queer adults might also wield some significant spending power. But it can still be difficult for new social apps to sustain themselves after initial interest bursts. For instance, BeReal, which was recently sold, has seen a decline in active users since its viral moment in 2022, according to recent estimates from Sensor Tower. It also recently laid off staff following its sale.\"We're so grateful for how far we've come from one little Instagram account, and we couldn't have done that without you all,\" Lex wrote in its \"Team Gay Agenda\" campaign letter. \"The future is queer, and the future has Lex in it.\""

The venture-backed start-up was set to run out of funding later this year and was having trouble garnering interest in a Series C.A spokesman for Voodoo and BeReal declined to comment.In a June interview with BI, Alexandre Yazdi, the CEO of Voodoo did not deny that BeReal would be hit with post-acquisition layoffs. Instead, he said the company wanted to \"keep all the good talent, the ones that are willing to work with us the way we want to work, the ones that are adapted to our culture and our strategy.\" Yazdi added that he intended to implement a \"sustainable business model\" as quickly as possible.BeReal launched in 2020 and skyrocketed in popularity during the pandemic, hailed as an \"anti-Instagram\" that prompted users once a day to take a picture of whatever they were doing within a two-minute window. Since then, the app has struggled to grow its user base, stalling around 25 million per day, according to internal figures, as BI reported previously.The startup raised $90 million in funding from venture capital heavyweights such as DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, and Accel. At its peak in May 2022, it was valued at around $600 million."

Employees working across several Cloud teams were informed that their jobs were being eliminated, according to an internal document reviewed by Business Insider and an employee familiar with the matter, whose identity BI confirmed and who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.The total number of affected staff could not be learned, although the cuts appear to have hit Google Cloud's \"Go To Market\" teams the hardest. One employee said it was rumored that close to 100 employees in Cloud's GTM group in the Asia-Pacific region were cut. A Google spokesperson said that number was lower. Teams focused on consulting, partner engineering, and sustainability were among those affected by layoffs, according to the document.The document noted that some recent hires were laid off, including at least one new recruit who had yet to complete their onboarding process. Some affected employees have been offered time to find new roles within the company.\"As we've shared before, we continue to evolve our business to meet our customers' priorities and the significant opportunity ahead,\" a Google spokesperson told BI in a statement. \"We maintain our commitment to investing in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.\" Layoffs have become the norm inside the search giant, which has been eliminating jobs all year and moving some roles to other locations. This week's Cloud layoffs appear to be more sweeping than Google's more surgical cuts to other teams in recent months.Google cut a \"small number\" of roles in its global affairs earlier this month, according to a copy of an email sent by Google's global affairs chief Kent Walker that was reviewed by BI. Business Post previously reported on those layoffs.Are you a current or former Google employee with insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "ComplYant was a tax-compliance startup that raised over $10 million in venture funding.The company abruptly shut down last year, and it took almost two months for employees to be paid.The founder and CEO cut off communication, deleting her accounts on LinkedIn, Instagram, and X.On a Friday morning in September, dozens of employees at ComplYant, a Los Angeles-based tax-compliance startup, logged on to Slack to watch a video their bleary-eyed CEO had recorded in the middle of the night. \"I'm coming to you all with some very unfortunate news,\" the CEO, Shiloh Johnson, said in the video, a copy of which Business Insider obtained. \"I know this comes as a deep shock to everyone, but the company is actually going through a wind-down process, and as a result we were ordered to furlough every employee immediately.\"Johnson told employees not to talk to anyone outside the company. She promised they'd soon get their final paycheck and any severance she could offer. It took nearly two months for all employees to be paid, and they never received any severance.\"We were all left between a rock and a hard place to make sure our mortgages were paid and we could pay the heating bill for our families,\" said Benjamin Matthews, ComplYant's former engineering manager. \"We are still not sure if we were paid everything we were owed.\"ComplYant, which raised over $10 million in venture funding, is hardly alone in its struggles. It was just one of over 3,000 startups that closed their doors last year, according to PitchBook. As venture funding has dried up, investors have been warning of a \"mass extinction event\" for startups. Still, amid the sea of startups closing, ComplYant's sudden demise has been a much-discussed topic in the tight-knit Los Angeles venture community.The speed with which the firm closed was striking. Even the human-resources firm retained to help employees with offboarding, Tandem, quit soon after the layoffs because it never got paid.Shannon Flynn Bevers, Tandem's president and founder, said that she tried to help employees but that Johnson stopped responding. \"In my career, I've never had that happen before,\" Flynn Bevers said. \"When startups go out of business, they will pay employees their final paycheck. They may not be able to give them severance, but the CEO is usually around to provide answers.\"The closure also offers a window into the toll of startup failure on the founder. Venture capitalists have predicted that startup founders will face an unprecedented mental-health crisis this year as an increasing number confront the cold reality of shuttering their firms.Making matters worse, many founders suffer in silence because they have been conditioned not to show weakness to their employees or investors. \"The majority of VCs don't want to hear about a founder's mental health,\" Josh Felser, an early-stage investor, previously told BI, speaking about startups in general. \"It's like, don't ask, don't tell.\"While employees were still trying to get their paychecks two weeks after the layoff, Johnson abruptly cut off communication. She deleted her accounts on LinkedIn, Instagram, and X after saying she was admitted to the hospital for major depressive disorder.\"This has been the hardest thing I have ever had to go through in my life and I am not handling it well,\" Johnson wrote in an email, viewed by BI, on October 4, right before she went silent. Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. BI interviewed eight former employees for this story; some requested anonymity because they were worried that speaking out could harm their job prospects. BI also reviewed emails, Slack messages, and other internal documents to better understand what happened.Despite their frustration at how things ended up, those who worked with Johnson say they mostly feel sympathy for her and miss working at a startup where they strongly believed in the mission.\"I hate this whole thing because I really, really like Shiloh,\" said Aerin Paulo, ComplYant's former head of marketing. \"She was the best boss I'd ever had. She was kind, considerate, and supportive.\" A seed round led by Craft Ventures and a tech success storyAfter working for nearly two decades as a certified public accountant, Johnson founded ComplYant in 2019. She said she was tired of saving large companies millions of dollars in tax bills while getting little in return. Her goal was to help small businesses navigate the labyrinth of tax regulations from state to state.\"At that point I was like, I'm pretty sure I can do this on my own and make way more money,\" Johnson told a podcaster last year. She added, \"I just wanted to be able to help people, and I wanted to be able to be the master of my own domain.\"Johnson invested $50,000 of her own money. She said the company was generating $28,000 in monthly recurring revenue just eight months after launching. ComplYant later raised a pre-seed round from Mucker Capital and Slauson &amp; Co., two LA early-stage venture firms. In 2021, it was accepted into the Techstars LA accelerator. ComplYant's 2022 seed-round fundraising deck. ComplYant The next year, ComplYant closed a $5.5 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, the top-tier San Francisco venture firm cofounded by the investor and podcaster David Sacks.\"Shiloh is a domain expert with a keen product sense on a mission to empower all types of business owners with fiscal guidance,\" Michael Tam, a partner at Craft Ventures, said in a press release at the time. \"This is the strong combination we look for as investors and we found it in spades with ComplYant.\" (Tam, who joined ComplYant's board, and other investors \u2014 Mucker Capital, Slauson &amp; Co., and Fika Ventures \u2014 declined to comment for this story.) As a rare Black female CEO in tech, Johnson represented a welcome success story in an industry overwhelmingly dominated by white men. She was featured on BI's list of 71 Black women who had raised $1 million or more in VC funding since 2021.ComplYant went on a spending spree starting in 2022, growing its head count to over 50 employees and flying them to Colorado for a team-building retreat at the end of July 2023, two months before the company shut down.Employees \u2014 many of whom were meeting for the first time because the company was fully remote \u2014 kayaked, cycled, did arts and crafts, and took new headshots. At night they ate a steak dinner and roasted s'mores by the fire. \"I've worked at other startups and never gone to something that nice,\" a former manager said. Several other former employees said they found the retreat excessive for a seed-stage startup.Johnson hosted a question-and-answer session and presented a rosy picture of the company's future. In various presentations last year, she mentioned the company had over $5 million in the bank and was raising a Series A funding round.\"It did not appear as if we were facing anything dire by any stretch of the imagination,\" Matthews said. But beneath the surface were significant problems.For one thing, former employees say ComplYant never developed a product-market fit. Its features, like helping businesses manually file tax extensions, were decidedly low-tech.Even though its services started at just $9.99 a month, ComplYant never had more than 50 paying users, according to former employees. \"The value that we offered for our customers was just not there,\" one of the employees said. \"We had a few things that people would pay for, but a lot of it was just around providing tax information in a calendar format.\"A few weeks after the Colorado retreat, the company missed its payroll, according to Slack messages seen by BI.\"Because she was telling us that there were millions of dollars in the bank account, we felt like we were pretty good,\" said Ryan Cady, a former software engineer at ComplYant. \"My interpretation now is that money just wasn't there when those paychecks didn't come through.\" Johnson told employees to take a weeklong furlough and blamed the issue on a technical snafu.\"I know I'm making a million and one mistakes but I'm learning as I hope we all are,\" Johnson wrote in a companywide Slack message after the furlough. \"It'll make for one hell of a book when we exit!\"This was not the first time payday came late, multiple employees said. \"There were quite a few missed payrolls,\" said Lusely Martinez, the company's former senior technical recruiter. \"That was one of the biggest warning signs.\"On September 19, a manager received an ominous message after a payment for one of the company's vendors was declined: \"All corporate credit cards for this company are locked.\"Four days later, it was supposed to be payday. Martinez logged on to her computer from her home office in New York. \"I had all these bills to pay, and so I was waiting for my direct deposit to come through,\" Martinez said. \"No one's payroll had gone through at that point, and we were all trying to figure out what had happened.\"A short time later, Johnson posted her video announcing it would be ComplYant's final day.Employees reacted on Slack with a range of emojis \u2013 grief, frustration, anxiety, chaos, and a dumpster fire. \"To be honest, I had kind of expected something like that to happen at some point,\" Cady said, \"but it came sooner than I anticipated.\"Nearly 2 months of waiting for a paycheckOn October 4, nearly two weeks after the layoffs, Johnson reiterated that paychecks were coming.\"I owe you all a little over $598k, to which I have access to about $250k, which I also have to pay vendors with as well,\" Johnson wrote. \"My plan is to liquidate equity on my house, which I am doing now to make up the difference.\" She also told employees they could file a claim with their state labor department or hire an employment lawyer.\"But contacting investors does not help get anyone paid sooner; it actually slows things down,\" Johnson said. \"This is not what I had planned and not how I wanted things to go, and unfortunately, you all are casualties in the fallout, but I WILL make it right.\"It ended up being another seven weeks before all employees were finally paid. Johnson had cut off all communication, and the HR company, Tandem, had stopped assisting employees after it wasn't paid either.Johnson's daughter, Taliah McGuire, formerly her executive assistant, sent a final email on November 20. (She did not respond to messages seeking comment and deleted her LinkedIn profile.)\"My only job was to help my mother get the owed money out, and now that I have, I no longer play a part in this situation,\" McGuire wrote. \"I will be deactivating this info email. I am unaware of what's going on with severance, but I am now assuming it probably won't happen due to the lack of money.\" McGuire added that her mother was pregnant.\"She is still struggling mentally with the loss of her company,\" McGuire wrote. \"This was very emotionally draining, and we have our finances to figure out the same way you all do.\"This year, Johnson, who was married last year and now goes by Shiloh Luckey, reemerged on TikTok, where she answers questions about taxes. Her account doesn't mention ComplYant; her bio simply says, \"Long time CPA.\"Money is still missingFormer employees were relieved to finally get the three weeks of pay they were owed, but they say some money is still missing.One former employee said she never received over $2,000 in expenses she was owed, while several former employees said they discovered their final 401(k) contributions never reached their retirement accounts. In a March email, seen by BI, a customer-service representative from the company's 401(k) provider, Penelope, told a former employee, \"The 401(k) contributions from your previous employer did not clear.\"The former employee wrote back that his former colleagues were considering their legal options, though he later said in an ex-employee Discord channel that it probably wasn't worth pursuing.\"We've likely got very little feasible recourse to recoup that money,\" he wrote. \"It was looking promising for a bit but in the end just another jab for us all.\" Making matters worse, because they were wired a lump sum of their final net pay and got no pay stub, former employees still don't know what happened to withheld taxes.\"We don't know what was given to the government as far as our salaries and what moneys were actually sent and were not sent,\" Matthews said, adding that he and his former colleagues found this all the more vexing given that the company's mission was helping small businesses streamline tax compliance.\"The irony is not lost on any of us,\" Matthews said."

Grin is a platform that helps brands access influencers for marketing campaigns and provides other creator tools. The company has raised a total of $145 million to date, per Crunchbase data, and was founded in 2014 by Brandon Brown, a former marketing manager at Red Bull.As the company grew, \"a distance also grew\" between the platform and its customers, the Grin spokesperson said in a statement. \"We need to close this gap and put the customer back at the center of how we work,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is no secret that the ongoing changes in the global economic environment have impacted many brilliant companies in the tech sector worldwide, demanding greater adaptability and resilience than ever before. Like many others in our community, Grin is not immune to these pressures and must take decisive action to ensure its sustainability and continued success.\"The spokesperson did not respond to a question about the size of the layoffs but indicated in the statement that \"many\" employees had been cut.Previously, the company conducted layoffs impacting roles across marketing and engineering. First, in November 2022, the company laid off 60 staffers, mostly in Grin's sales department, the company confirmed to BI at the time. Then, in March 2023, the company laid off several staffers across multiple departments, sources close to the company told Business Insider. Some staffers were caught off guard by the 2023 layoffs.\"I do feel hurt by the cuts,\" a former staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect career prospects, told BI last year. \"I feel like my team in general pulled all nighters and weekend hours to get a critical project done.\"Grin is among several creator-economy startups that have laid off staff in recent months, including Jellysmack, which laid off 30 staffers in the US and France in January, and esports organization FaZe Clan, which cut 20% of staff in 2023. The impacted staffers in this latest round of cuts will receive a three-month severance package and extended healthcare benefits, the Grin spokesperson said. \"Reductions are never easy, and we are so grateful and proud of the incredible work our team has delivered to date,\" the spokesperson said."

        "Extracted Article": "Criteo told staffers this week it's reducing its global headcount by up to 4%.The reduction, which could affect around 140 people, comes ahead of Google's plan to kill cookies.Criteo has previously said cookie deprecation could dent its revenue by up to $40 million this year.Criteo, the publicly traded adtech company, told staffers this week it would lay off up to 4% of its staff, people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. The company had 3,563 employees as of December 31, meaning the reduction could affect around 140 people.A Criteo spokesperson confirmed the news, saying in a statement that the company regularly reviews its business to ensure its resources align with its strategy and financial performance. \"As a result, we've made the difficult decision to reduce headcount by up to 4% globally,\" the statement said. \"This change provides greater operational efficiency and enables us to invest in our growth areas.\"Founded in Paris in 2005, Criteo became known as the poster child of retargeting, an advertising method where advertisers specifically target people who had shown an interest in their products \u2014 for example, hitting someone who had previously browsed a jacket on a website with an ad for the same item, enticing them to return.But with the owners of web browsers and app operating systems clamping down on the tracking technology that powers retargeting, and global privacy laws making it easier to opt out of being tracked, retargeting has become much harder. In response, Criteo has sought to pivot its business to focus on the commerce media space, offering retailers tools to help sell ads on their apps and websites. It's also making a push in connected TV, letting its retail clients use data about their audiences to target users on TV and measure whether those ads drove sales.But these efforts are still relatively new for Criteo. The company said in February that \"more than 50%\" of its revenue comes from \"non-retargeting solutions,\" but retargeting still makes up a sizable, more profitable chunk.And its \"performance media\" segment, in which retargeting sits, is set to be dealt another blow in the coming months when Google's Chrome is expected to turn off support for third-party cookies. Chrome is the world's biggest web browser, used by around two-thirds of web users. Criteo said the expected Chrome cookie deprecation would negatively impact its revenue by between $30 million and $40 million by the end of this year, if Google goes ahead with its scheduled timeline, set for the fourth quarter of 2024. Criteo has been working to test alternative technologies to cookies as part of Google's Privacy Sandbox program. However, it's unclear whether those will be able to provide the same level of targeting and measurement in the long run.Industry speculation has grown in recent years that Criteo could become a prime takeover target. Its stock is currently trading at around $35, below its all-time high of nearly $59 in 2014.In February, the European activist investor Petrus Advisers raised its holding in the company to 5.5%. It wrote a public letter to Criteo's management team urging the company to perform a \"comprehensive strategic review, including to evaluate all ownership options.\" Criteo said in response that it was reviewing the letter and that it hoped to \"engage constructively\" with Petrus. In its most recent quarter, Criteo reported a return to profit on flat revenue, having made $70 million in cost savings over 2023. The company said on its earnings call that it would continue to be rigorous on cost efficiencies to offset wage inflation, while continuing to invest in growth areas.Criteo also made a round of layoffs last year, Digiday reported, though the company didn't disclose the number of employees affected."

Messenger, the popular direct-messaging app within Facebook, was hit with a round of layoffs this week, according to two people familiar with the company. The cuts, which affected fewer than 50 employees, were part of a reorganization of Messenger and its operations.The cuts at Messenger followed a similar layoff that affected some employees working at Instagram, as Business Insider reported. Both organizations are said to have eliminated many technical-program-manager roles, effectively folding such work into the role of product managers. After Instagram removed the TPM position, other parts of Meta, including the Facebook organization in which Messenger sits, were expected to do the same, BI reported. A company spokesman declined to comment beyond saying Meta's efficiency work was ongoing.Although CEO Mark Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 his \"year of efficiency\" (laying off more than 20,000 employees, eliminating some manager roles, and putting an end to years of \"hyper-growth\"), he decided this year to keep it in place for the foreseeable future. This has led to a culture shift within Meta, with some managers taking pride in finding places to cut costs or slim down teams. A related spate of reorganizations is creating a sense of constant anxiety among some workers.The Facebook business last year underwent a structural change to simplify how it operates. It also was hit with layoffs, and cuts were expected to continue within the organization this year. It remains Meta's largest organization in terms of head count, with the most mature tools and platforms. Are you a Meta employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

The London-based company, which first launched in 2014 and offers tailored dog food plans developed by its vet and nutrition team, had raised $16 million in venture capital funding from the likes of Octopus Ventures and Slingshot Ventures before retail giant Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare acquired a majority stake in the company in 2018. Tails.com has operated as a stand-alone company since.&nbsp;In January, the company announced internally that it planned to commence a round of layoffs that could affect up to 55 staffers in the UK, per documents seen by BI. \"In 2023 we carried out a review of our strategy and operating model to ensure that Tails.com is set up as a strong and sustainable business for the long term,\" a company spokesperson told BI. \"This work identified some ways in which we can work more efficiently and we are now looking at how that will impact our teams.\"The spokesperson said that it had \"notified the appropriate UK government authorities of proposed changes to the business\" and that Tails.com was following the processes set out.\"Until the consultation has taken place, there are no immediate changes to the business and we wouldn't disclose any additional confidential information as part of that process out of respect for both our employees and the legal process,\" the spokesperson added. Per UK employment law, the company is required to offer a statutory redundancy package to those affected by the layoffs. The documents stated that employees aged under 22 would get half a week\u2019s pay for each year of service; those between 22 and under 41 would receive one week\u2019s pay for each year of service; and those above 41 would receive 1.5 weeks\u2019 pay for each year of service. The statutory pay would be capped at \u00a3643, which is $809, a week.&nbsp;News of the impending redundancies had surprised employees, a current staffer told BI.&nbsp;\u201cWe had this weekly meeting where they talked about our forecasts, and they kept saying, \u2018we\u2019re doing really well\u2019,\u201d the employee said. The company met 98% of its bonus targets last year, per documents seen by BI. But they also say that, despite investing heavily in growth, it incurred a loss of \u00a310 million, around $12.6 million, last year. It now aims to get to a \"double-digit growth rate\" in 2024, so it can become self-sustaining by 2026.While the company documents acknowledged that it had hired 22 new roles in the past six months, they also said hiring for any non-critical business roles had been paused since November 2023.The layoffs were necessary to enable Tails.com \u201cto deliver a more efficient strategy\u201d and allow it \u201cto scale in a financially sustainable way that balances revenue and profit growth,\u201d the documents said. Tails.com said that the decision to lay people off was taken by its own executives, not its parent company Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 although its board \u201csupported the decision,\u201d the leaked documents show.Tech companies have laid off around 39,000 staffers globally in the first two months of 2024, per Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous rounds of layoffs, these ones are happening while many tech companies are producing good financial results.Grammarly, Microsoft, and Google all laid off employees in 2024 \u2014 claiming that they were instead reorienting their finances to more strategic teams and goals.

The layoffs will impact \"few hundred roles,\" Amazon's spokesperson confirmed in an email to BI.One person said roughly 115 positions may be eliminated. Another estimated up to 400 employees could lose their jobs. The company had planned to announce the layoffs before February 1, but had delayed it due to Amazon's recent earnings report and other internal issues, they said. The plan is part of a company-wide mandate to reduce One Medical's fixed cost structure, these people said. Amazon's leadership wants One Medical to significantly decrease its operating losses and asked the healthcare company to save an additional $100 million this year, one of the people said. One Medical had an operating loss of $420 million in 2022, the last year it publicly disclosed financial results before getting acquired by Amazon.Amazon has started the year with a flurry of job cuts across a number of units including Twitch, Prime Video, Audible, and Amazon Pay. Still, there is heightened anxiety about more job cuts at Amazon as CFO Brian Olsavsky last week declined to say layoffs are over during a call with reporters.In an email to BI, Amazon's Amazon Health Services Senior Vice President Neil Lindsay confirmed the layoffs. \"We're seeing very strong momentum and positive customer feedback across our health care offerings. As we continue our mission to make health care simpler for customers, we're realigning some resources to help accelerate our efforts to deliver the best experience for our patients, customers, and members,\" Lindsay said in the statement.\"Unfortunately, these adjustments will result in the elimination of a few hundred roles within Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical. We're grateful to these team members for their contributions, and we will support them in their next steps. We will continue hiring providers and investing in teams and technology that will help us provide high-quality and accessible care to more people,\" he added. Related stories More control over One MedicalOne Medical is one of the mega acquisitions Amazon made during a pandemic-driven boom. Amazon purchased film studio MGM for $8.5 billion in 2021, then announced plans to buy both One Medical and Roomba-maker iRobot in 2022. Covid-related growth didn't continue as expected, and Amazon has responded by aggressively cutting costs. Over the past 18 months or so, it has laid off at least 27,000 employees and axed a number of long-term projects. The iRobot deal also recently fell through due to regulatory issues.Cost cutting projectionsOne Medical plans to consolidate its marketing resources with Amazon's own healthcare business, the people said. One Medical also wants to integrate corporate functions across real estate, compliance, finance, and HR, while centralizing support roles. New artificial intelligence tools are expected to increase productivity and save costs as well, according to one of the people familiar with the situation.

The company also aims to reduce the cost of each patient's visit to $322 in 2024, from $372 in 2023. That will be accomplished mainly by increasing the number of patients served, one of the people said. Amazon recently rolled out a new One Medical discount option for Prime members. Amazon has been exerting more control over One Medical since closing the $3.9 billion acquisition in early 2023, according to three current employees.

        "Extracted Article": "Astarte Medical is shutting down, Business Insider has learned exclusively.The venture-backed startup sells software to hospitals to improve care for preterm infants.Its CEO explains how she decided to wind down the business and find buyers after eight years.Tracy Warren cofounded Astarte Medical in 2016 to improve care for premature babies. Eight years later, at the end of December, she told her board of directors over a tearful Zoom call that she planned to shut the company down.The somber call capped Astarte's story before the company truly hit its stride. Astarte, which sells software to standardize nutrition for babies in intensive care units, had raised $14 million in venture funding to date and landed contracts with four hospitals. It had big ambitions to keep growing and building out its tech. But the market downturn hit Astarte hard \u2014 and its customers even harder. Last year, the startup wasn't able to land as many new contracts as it hoped, with hospitals struggling to manage their slim margins. And without more customers, Astarte's revenue fell short of VCs' higher standards for a new investment.Astarte now plans to sell itself for parts and lay off its remaining staff, Business Insider has learned exclusively. Its quiet death fulfills the prophecy investors have been fighting against since mid-2022 \u2014 that many startups, struggling to grow revenue and raise more venture funding against the market headwinds, will be forced to this year to shut their doors for good.Warren said that without seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, she couldn't keep fighting against those headwinds. \"As a former investor, you can't drink the Kool-Aid for long,\" she said.Astarte's beginningsWarren founded Astarte in 2016 with Tammi Jantzen, a former colleague from the venture world, and Katherine Gregory, a former nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.Gregory had an idea to combine her research around the gut microbiomes of preterm infants with clinical data in electronic medical records to look for insights, and perhaps even generate predictions, to improve health outcomes for those infants. At first, Jantzen and Warren didn't know how to make Gregory's vision a reality. They invested their own money to get Astarte off the ground, funding a study at Brigham and Women's Hospital to analyze samples of more than 300 infants' gut microbiomes over their first several months of life. Nenov Brothers Images/Shutterstock The company announced its first round of venture funding, a $5 million Series A from backers including Viking Global Investors and Ben Franklin Technology Partners, in May 2019, and then built its first software product, the only product it would ultimately sell to hospitals, called NICUtrition. That software, designed for NICU hospital units, helps healthcare professionals adhere to feeding protocols for preterm infants as they are first fed through an IV after birth, through a tube through the nose or mouth after a few days, and eventually tapered off to feed normally.The startup wanted to get babies in the NICU growing on track with the development they'd see in utero \u2014 preterm infants are often still underweight when leaving the hospital \u2014 and set them up for long-term health, while creating more efficient systems for the clinicians caring for them in hospitals. But from early on, \"it was clear to all of us that selling to hospitals was going to be an uphill battle,\" Jantzen said.Fighting for dealsAstarte signed its first hospital contract at the end of 2020, then another in 2021 before raising $7.6 million in Series A-1 funding, primarily from its existing investors, that fall. Under those three-year contracts, hospitals pay Astarte monthly for use of its software.As healthcare funding surged in 2021, Warren said the startup had a game plan to land 10 to 15 customers and prove it could replicate its business at scale. But while Astarte was getting lots of first meetings with hospitals, the sales cycles had gotten longer after the COVID-19 pandemic tanked hospital margins, and Astarte was struggling to close deals. Then, in 2022, the market tanked.\"There was a lot of apathy in the market from the hospital side, fighting other fires,\" Warren said. \"Nothing was trending in the way of innovation, for sure.\" Astarte Medical's NutritionIQ product. Astarte Medical Astarte landed one more hospital customer in 2023, bringing its total customer count to four: Carilion Children's Hospital in Virginia, Gillette Children's Hospital in Minnesota, UVA Children's Hospital, and Arkansas Children's Hospital. But that one contract was supposed to be three, Warren said. The company had raised a small amount of debt from investors in the summer of 2023, and set out to raise more venture funding with the guidelines of closing three deals that year \u2014 ultimately missing its target by more than half.Astarte's revenue figures weren't hitting the mark, either. Warren said investors were looking for the \"magic number\" of $3 million in annual contracts. Astarte was banking less than $500,000 a year in contracts.Warren said Astarte's investors even had conversations about working artificial intelligence into the startup's pitches with new VCs to capitalize on the funding boom to AI startups. But Astarte ultimately decided not to make the promise to build AI into its tech for clinical decision-making.\"Honestly, it would've been disingenuous,\" she said. \"We had to tell our board, we've got the data, but we're not at the point where I would feel comfortable making recommendations based on that data.\"At the end of 2023, Warren said she took a hard look at the business and decided the best path forward would be to wind down Astarte. \"I knew how much money we would need to weather the next two years, and what we needed to raise relative to our stage,\" Warren said. \"Maybe if I'd seen a light that hospitals were going to get better, or that venture was going to come back strong. But it was kind of dismal.\" Astarte Medical's eight-person team. Astarte Medical Selling itself for partsNow, Astarte is looking for buyers. The startup is considering selling multiple assets, including its software and patient datasets, Warren said.Astarte laid off its remaining seven employees in January, she said. The startup is hoping to find a buyer by the end of the first quarter of the year. Astarte still has money in the bank, and can afford to keep the company together as it searches for the right buyer, Warren said. Once that sale happens, Astarte plans to start settling its debts, and then pay back its investors.Warren said she just wants Astarte's work to be carried on.\"The biggest thing for us is that patients actually get serviced,\" she said. \"If nothing else, our legacy should be that we've helped improve the lives of babies and their families.\""

The startup, which matches nurses and other clinicians to open jobs in healthcare, cut staff on Wednesday, according to two former employees and more than a dozen LinkedIn posts. The former employees asked not to be identified to avoid retribution from the company.Nomad Health's chief marketing officer Maquel Shaw confirmed the layoffs in an email to Business Insider. She didn't say how many employees were impacted and declined to comment on the reasoning for the cuts. The most recent round of layoffs cap a stormy year for Nomad, as the startup grappled with hospital budget pressures by making multiple cuts to its staff. The startup previously cut 25% of its nonclinical workforce in October, Business Insider first reported. Nomad had already cut 17% of its staff earlier that year, in February, per Forbes.At the time of the October layoffs, Shaw said the cuts were a \"necessary but painful response\" to the changing needs of Nomad's hospital customers.\"While demand for contract nurses and allied health professionals remains high, healthcare organizations are grappling with budget shortfalls, which directly impact their immediate staffing demands,\" she said in an October statement to Business Insider. A number of medical staffing startups made cuts last year in response to the market downturn. Staffing platform CareRev cut 33% of its corporate workforce in June. The following month, nurse staffing startup ConnectRN slashed 20% of its staff, and IntelyCare laid off at least 30 employees.It's a grim new reality for the sector, which once attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capitalists to solve healthcare's staffing crisis. But that funding window all but closed at the end of 2022. Like most of its medical staffing peers, Nomad Health last raised capital that year, banking $105 million in June 2022.Do you have a tip about Nomad Health that you want to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey told staff in a note that a \"large number\" of workers were being laid off.It's Block's second layoff in recent weeks, though this one is much larger than the first.Last year, Dorsey told staff the company's workforce had grown more than its business.Jack Dorsey this week made good on his promise to conduct layoffs at Block. The cofounder and CEO who previously ran Twitter told Block staff on Tuesday that the financial-tech company was letting go of \"a large number of our teammates,\" according to a note viewed by Business Insider. This is Block's second layoff in two months, with the company in December laying off 40 people working on the music-streaming app Tidal. While Dorsey did not specify the number of Block employees laid off on Tuesday, a person familiar with the company said the number was close to 1,000.Dorsey did say that the layoffs focused on Block workers at Cash App, Foundational, and Square. He added that operations overall were \"getting leaner.\" Last year, Dorsey alluded to further layoffs on the horizon for Block. In previous notes reported by BI, Dorsey said he would put \"constraints\" on the company's growth because head count had grown more than the company's business. Staffers were told separately that Block would look to reduce head count by about 10%, as BI reported.A company spokesperson did not deny the number of layoffs but reiterated Block's plans from last year to cap head count at about 12,000 employees, a reduction from the 13,000 workers it had late last year.While Block's staff was told to expect cuts, along with drastic changes to how performance would be evaluated going forward, in previous notes, Dorsey made it seem as though the process would occur over several months. Laying off about 1,000 people in one day is close to the 10% reduction discussed internally. \"We decided it would be better to do at once rather than arbitrarily space them out, which didn't seem fair to the individuals or to the company,\" Dorsey said in his Tuesday note. \"When we know we need to take an action, we want to take it immediately, rather than let things linger on forever.\"The new cuts at Block add to an already heavy year for layoffs in tech. Google and Amazon made significant cuts to head count, while Meta is slimming down in a more roundabout way by eliminating certain job titles and telling affected workers they can reapply.You can read Dorsey's full note to Block's staff below: Team,Today our Cash App, Foundational, and Square teams are parting ways with a large number of our teammates. Following the \"constraints\" email I sent last year, each team took some time to evaluate themselves through a lens of stronger performance and stricter prioritization. Cash assessed each team's position against Cash App's long-term strategy to determine where reduction, consolidation, or reorganization is needed \u2014 Global, Marketing, and Commerce are most affected, however every discipline is getting leaner. Foundational focused on restructuring, centralizing, and reducing layers of management to address redundancies. For Square, the majority of our impacts fall within the Marketing, Creative, and PMM teams, where we've reduced overall budgets so we need to adjust team sizes.Why is so much happening in one single day? All of these teams were confident in the direction they're taking, and were ready to take action within the same 2-3 weeks. We decided it would be better to do at once rather than arbitrarily space them out, which didn't seem fair to the individuals or to the company.When we know we need to take an action, we want to take it immediately, rather than let things linger on forever.By now our teammates who will be leaving us have been notified, and throughout the day we'll be connecting with those entering a consultation process in countries where it's required.Are you a Block employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Tiger Global-backed software startup Productboard is making another round of layoffs, sources say.The company, dubbed a Salesforce for product managers, was valued at $1.7 billion two years ago.Productboard was a rising star in Silicon Valley, winning over high-profile investors like Sequoia.Productboard, a software startup backed by some of the world's biggest tech investors, has instigated its third round of layoffs less than two years after it became a unicorn, Business Insider understands. The San Francisco-based company, touted as a Salesforce for product managers, was last valued at $1.7 billion in a round led by US hedge fund Tiger Global and Californian investor Dragoneer in February 2022.Since then, the company has conducted a series of layoffs, beginning in November of that year when it cut a fifth of its workforce, two former employees said. Another 10% of its headcount was cut in August last year, they said. Now, Productboard has begun another round of layoffs, the scale of which is unknown as yet, the former staffers said. Others have also spoken about the cuts on LinkedIn.The company did not respond to BI's request for comment.Productboard was founded in 2014 by two engineers from the Czech Republic, Daniel Hejl and Hubert Palan. The company boasts a list of 5,400 customers, including Microsoft, Zoom, UiPath, and Volkswagen. It became a rising star in Silicon Valley, raising $261.7 million from the region's highest-profile investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Index Ventures.Productboard is far from the only pandemic-era star to cull jobs as the economic landscape worsened. Startups and Big Tech companies alike have slashed their wage bills as the high-interest rate environment encourages businesses to prioritize sustainability over growth.In January alone, 76 tech companies have laid off 21,370 employees, according to tracker site Layoffs.fyi. This year's cuts add to the 262,595 job losses announced in 2023. Productboard employed over 500 at its peak in spring 2022, with CEO Palan even telling Bloomberg that the company planned to go public in 2025. Since then, IPOs have become increasingly rare with late-stage companies struggling to find follow-on investment as growth funding disappeared.The startup builds software for product teams to collaborate and incorporate feedback from customers, designers, and managers to ultimately create a better end result. In all, that optimizes workflow.The November 2022 cut at Productboard was deep but justified \u2014 many other startups had faced reductions of up to 15%, and Big Tech had already gone through two rounds of layoffs by then, one former employee told BI. But a different former staffer told BI it instigated a turning point for the company. \"It felt like everything sort of started drying up after the first round of layoffs \u2014 likely due to the market uncertainties; because of this the business felt like changes were required,\" they said.One ex-staffer put consecutive rounds of layoffs down to the slow pace of growth. As a result, the company frequently reorganized, changed priorities, and staffers struggled to show results, they said.LinkedIn now puts Productboard's headcount at 350."

        "Extracted Article": "GoStudent, valued at $3 billion two years ago, is laying off staff again.The Austrian edtech unicorn raised $95 million in equity and debt last summer.The latest cuts follow previous rounds of layoffs in September and December 2022.SoftBank-backed education startup GoStudent has initiated another round of layoffs, affecting over 100 people, Business Insider understands. Although the company has not released specific figures, three former employees estimated that at least 100 staffers across all teams and markets were told on Tuesday, January 23, that they were to be let go.Austrian company GoStudent, billed as Europe's first edtech unicorn, offers one-to-one video tutoring. It was valued at $3 billion in its last funding round and is backed by some of tech's biggest investors, including SoftBank and Coatue. The scale of the layoffs is unclear. GoStudent employs more than 1,500 people, including its acquisitions, across at least 15 countries with different labor laws, per company figures from October 27, 2023.GoStudent did not confirm the scale of the layoffs when approached for comment by BI.CEO and cofounder Felix Ohswald confirmed the cuts on LinkedIn last week, stating that, while GoStudent had reduced its burn rate by 70%, it was \"still too high in light of the challenging market conditions.\" The business and strategy adjustments aim to make GoStudent fully profitable and cashflow positive \"as quickly as possible,\" he said.GoStudent was among a batch of startups to benefit from an uptick in demand during the pandemic as more people stayed at home and education went remote. But since then, the company has moved to reduce its wage bill repeatedly through layoffs.Indeed, it is far from the only company to endure several rounds of layoffs as the high-interest rate environment curbed investor spending on loss-making startups. This year, 82 tech companies have laid off 23,670 employees, according to tracker site Layoffs.fyi. It adds to the 262,595 job losses announced in 2023. GoStudent has also previously faced public scrutiny for lax vetting processes for its freelance tutors, tutor working conditions and being anti-competitive. The startup also held a lavish party, including fire dancers and tattoo artists, six months after it raised its Series D round in January 2022.The fresh round of layoffs is GoStudent's third following cuts in September and December of 2022, all previously reported by BI. Some employees were also let go in September 2023, according to three former staffers. A GoStudent spokesperson told BI that these were \"business as usual adjustments.\"One-to-one meetings and country-specific all-hands were scheduled throughout the day on Tuesday, January 23, three former employees said. A company-wide all-hands followed in the afternoon, announcing the changes to others, they said. \"I've been through so many of these firings with this company that where there's smoke, there's fire. People start talking and you get a sense of it. It's almost like PTSD, I just knew it was coming,\" one former staffer said.In a LinkedIn post announcing the cuts, Ohswald said the company had \"said goodbye to really, really great people.\"\"In other markets, we notified our teams to initiate their respective legal processes,\" he said. \"Because of this, there are some questions we just can't answer right now, and this makes everything so much more difficult for our team.\" The GoStudent CEO added that it had been an \"incredibly hard day\" but said there was a \"clear vision for this year.\"The company is cutting back some of its efforts outside of the DACH region, which consists of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, four former employees told BI. However, the company disputed this, saying that its commitment to customers and tutors in all markets \"remains unchanged.\"\"We have adjusted our paid growth strategy; however, we will continue to cultivate all markets, ensuring they are properly resourced,\" GoStudent said. It has pulled most of its marketing spend outside of DACH, according to one of the former employees and screen shots of a presentation seen by BI.\"In DACH, where we have been profitable for some time, we will continue to grow - working together with Studienkreis to double down on hybrid learning,\" Ohswald wrote on LinkedIn.\"Outside of DACH we remain fully committed to serving all markets; however, we will adopt a more organic growth strategy and will reassess the size of our market teams.\""

The search giant plans to cut hundreds of roles from its advertising-sales unit as part of a restructuring, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, told staff Tuesday in a memo.Schindler wrote that the cuts were the result of changes to how Google's sales team operated. BI previously reported that Google was shifting more staff away from large-customer sales, a team that serves the company's bigger advertising clients, to its Google customer-solutions team, which serves more medium-level clients. This was happening as more large clients didn't need access to as many of Google's resources, current and former employees said.This reorganization is the next evolution of that as cuts appear to be primarily targeted at the large-customer-sales team.\"Going forward GCS will be our core channel for scaling growth by dynamically delivering the right treatment to every customer \u2014 while LCS will focus on transformational growth for our largest, most sophisticated customers,\" Schindler wrote. He later added: \"While I'm confident we're doing the right thing for our customers, partners, and ultimately for our business, this will be very hard for many, especially across our LCS teams.\"Google is also attempting to automate more of its processes through products such as Performance Max, which uses Google's artificial intelligence to determine how advertisers' money should be spent across products. (A spokesperson told BI that this reorganization is unrelated to AI tools such as Performance Max).Chris Pappas, a Google spokesperson, told BI in a statement: \"Every year we go through a rigorous process to structure our team to provide the best service to our ads customers. \"We map customers to the right specialist teams and sales channels to meet their service needs.&nbsp;As part of this, a few hundred roles globally are being eliminated and impacted employees will be able to apply for open roles on the team or elsewhere at Google.\"The cuts come just days after Google made another round of layoffs across several other organizations, including its devices unit that houses Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest. At least 1,000 employees were cut in that round, according to a statement from the Alphabet Workers Union.In November, BI reported that Google's top and longtime ad exec, Jerry Dischler, was stepping down to be replaced by Vidhya Srinivasan, who joined the tech giant in 2019. Here's Schindler's memo in full:Team,Last month at GBO Live I shared our GBO 2024+ Strategy. We had a candid conversation on our rapidly evolving business reality, the profound moment we're in with AI, and how we'll intensify our focus on customer and partner growth. More than 20k of you watched, and overall, you gave us extremely positive feedback.As part of the session, I also made clear that a substantial channel shift was coming and that regularly adjusting organizational structures based on customer needs, the overall market environment, and available resourcing is a normal part of running a business diligently. This is nothing new for GBO; we've done this for many years \u2014 sometimes smaller, sometimes at a larger scale \u2014 and will continue to do so.In the last six months alone, we've executed strategic changes across three different teams: Global Partnerships, gTech, and Global Product Solutions \u2014 all aligned with our GBO growth principles. Each shift had a clear catalyst and expected impact with customer and partner needs as top priority. Internally, these moves are speeding up decision-making and velocity, simplifying complexity, and reducing hierarchy, laters, and duplication of work.This week, we're announcing the evolution of our sales operating model across LCS and GCS. Our goal has always been to have the right customer, mapped to the right channel for growth, with the best support models and streamlined operations. Every year we go through a rigorous channel management process to assess this and adjust customers accordingly. This year's adjustment will be more sizable than usual \u2014 similar to what we did in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 and it will play into the strengths of each of our sales teams. Going forward, GCS will be our core channel for scaling growth by dynamically delivering the right treatment for every customer \u2014 while LCS will focus on transformational growth for our largest, most sophisticated customers.As part of this shift, unfortunately, several hundred jobs will be eliminated or put at risk (subject to local regulations and consultations). Impacted GBOers will be supported throughout the process and can apply for open positions across our team (including some roles we'll be adding to take care of additional customers moving to GCS) or elsewhere across Google. Sadly though, we will have to say goodbye to many highly talented and amazing sales colleagues. There's no easy or best way to do this, but I've asked designated leaders to communicate personally with impacted folks in 1:1s. These conversations will start tomorrow across all regions; in EMEA, this process may take longer due to local regulations and practices. Next steps will be shared as quickly and respectfully as possible to minimize uncertainty.While I'm confident we're doing the right thing for our customers, partners, and ultimately our business, this will be very hard for many, especially across our LCS teams. Thank you for continuing to show up for each other with empathy, respect, and kindness. At GBO Live in two weeks we'll further discuss and answer all your open questions.Philipp."

The change at the popular platform happened this week and affected technical program managers across the Instagram organization, according to two people familiar with the company and a post to Blind, an app popular with tech workers that verifies users' employment. The TPM role is essentially being eliminated at Instagram, but workers are being given the opportunity to apply and reinterview to become a product manager. However if they aren't selected for a new role, their employment will end in March.A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment. A former Instagram employee posted to LinkedIn about \"expected changes to TPM roles,\" adding that people are expected to \"re-interview for PM roles\" or product manager roles.TPMs in tech are positioned between technical workers like engineers and PMs. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg invoked last year a new company mantra of \"efficiency\" aimed at removing layers of management. The result was thousands of layoffs last year and a reduction in management ranks, as well as the rate of hiring and promotions, although the company has been hiring back some laid off workers.The elimination of TPMs is in line with what's been referred to as \"the flattening\" at Meta. Beyond layoffs, Meta's restructuring last year included some other management roles being eliminated, and many employees at the management level were told they could \"convert\" to another role not in management, as BI reported. After most of the planned mass layoffs were over last year, Zuckerberg in a meeting with employees did not deny that more jobs would be eliminated in the future. Insiders later told BI that the CEO was still looking to get the company's overall head count closer to where it was in 2020 before it went on a massive hiring spree. CFO Susan Li, too, noted changes would come to the company as it looked at projects and teams to \"wind down.\"Over the ensuing months, Meta employees were left to wonder if and when more cuts to head count would come as they were ordered to return to the office or else face being fired. A smaller layoff last fall hit a team in Reality Labs.Are you a tech employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

It announced the job cuts to staff on Thursday.Four people close to the company, including one person impacted by the layoffs, characterized the job cuts as part of a strategic shift away from its consumer-facing business and toward its B2B trading technology. A spokesperson for Mojo said the company was not selling its B2C business, but declined to comment on whether there was a strategy shift. \"Regretfully, we let go of about 20% of the company today,\" the spokesperson said of the layoffs. \"It's certainly a sad day for our company and we thank those talented employees for their many contributions.\"Mojo had about 95 full-time employees as of last year, according to a 2022 pitch deck. The company would not comment on the current number of employees.Mojo, founded by Lore, Rodriguez, and entrepreneurs Vinit Bharara and Bart Stein, had raised $100 million from backers including Thrive Capital and the NFL Players Association. Mojo operates a sort of player stock market where users can trade on an athlete's performance as if it were shares in a company. The app launched in New Jersey in September 2022 and the company released this year a fantasy sports offering in 19 states and Washington, DC.Mojo is one of the last of an era of big venture-backed pre-revenue sports-betting operators that raised a lot of money to disrupt the US market. Sports betting is very expensive to compete in and the market for these companies has changed dramatically in the last two to three years. Funding has become harder for startups to come by and investors at all stages want to see a path to profitability in addition to significant user growth.\"Mojo was very ambitious and it was going to take a long time to find product market fit and profitability,\" one of the people close to the company said. \"It's one of the last dinosaurs of that type of startup.\" The company is one of several startups across the sports-betting landscape to cut jobs this year, in what has been a tough climate for early-stage companies in general.Mojo said it would have more news to share soon about what's next for the company.\"Stay tuned for some exciting developments soon,\" the spokesperson said."

At the time, the company said it planned to continue growing after the combination, including by hiring more employees. Shortly after the deal closed, though, the newly formed Commure cut staff, according to a leaked email obtained by Business Insider.Commure CEO Tanay Tandon, formerly the CEO of Athelas, said in the November 9 email to employees that it cut staff \"determined to be redundant or whose service is otherwise no longer needed.\" The company didn't say how many people were affected. The layoffs came just a month after Tandon told Business Insider that Commure planned to hire \"aggressively\" following the merger. Commure didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.Commure provides a common data language for health systems to simplify tasks like moving patients between different providers, while Athelas creates software for tasks like AI-powered revenue cycle management. The new company said in October it plans to stack Athelas' software on top of Commure's data platform for its health-system clients.Asked by Bloomberg News in October if Commure would have to cut staff as part of the deal, Tandon suggested the company would instead seek to grow its headcount, including perhaps by hiring people affected by layoffs at numerous other healthcare companies since 2022. \"I think we're going to be one of the biggest hirers in the next year in healthcare and software, so hopefully a home for many of the folks that did get laid off in the last year or two,\" he said.Tandon told Business Insider in October that Commure's total headcount following the merger would be about 800. At the time, he said the company had about 100 positions open, and expected to hire hundreds more people in 2024.He added that Commure hoped to hire more employees in its sales and engineering divisions. The company does show openings in those divisions on its websites. A former employee affected by the layoffs, who requested anonymity to avoid retribution from the company, told Business Insider that staff were cut across the sales and engineering segments, as well as divisions like human resources, recruiting, and marketing.Both Commure and Athelas each had at least five years of cash runway before the merger, Tandon told Business Insider in October.He said the company expected to go public in the next two to three years.

        "Extracted Article": "Travis Kalanick's ghost kitchen company laid staff off on Wednesday.In 2021, Kalanick raised $850 million at a $15 billion valuation for the company.The cuts come as tech and real estate companies rethink staffing needs in a more difficult market.Travis Kalanick's ghost kitchen company cut jobs on Wednesday, two employees told Insider. Before the layoffs, City Storage Systems had more than 4,300 employees. It wasn't immediately clear how many CSS employees were affected.Staff were told on Wednesday that they would receive invitations for meetings with human resources if their jobs were being eliminated, and the company scheduled an afternoon all-hands meeting, according to the two employees who spoke with Insider. They asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive topic. Through CSS, Kalanick wants to reinvent the business of food, just as he upended the taxi industry globally by founding Uber. CSS units include CloudKitchens, which renovates US and Canada warehouses into ghost kitchen facilities for mom-and-pop restaurateurs and big companies like Chik-fil-A. Another arm, called Otter, creates software for ghost kitchens and brick-and-mortar restaurants. In fall 2021, Kalanick raised $850 million for CSS from investors including Microsoft, at a $15 billion valuation.The layoffs come in the midst of a difficult market for tech and real estate companies, with inflation, higher interest rates, and other headwinds.A CloudKitchens spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Customer issues in kitchens and with softwareCloudKitchens went on a warehouse-buying spree in 2019 through 2021, before interest rates skyrocketed. But as its facilities have come online, the company has struggled with high customer churn. Operators&nbsp;told Insider last year&nbsp;that CloudKitchens sold them a dream but sometimes delivered dirty kitchens in locations lacking adequate safety and technical support. Related stories The company owns more than 70 active locations across the US, though some sites sit nearly empty and at least 10 have been up for sale or changed hands in the last year, per public records and interviews with former real estate employees.The US real estate team has been cut over the last year, leaving a few employees focused on renovations and asset management instead of the acquisitions-focused groups that worked regionally. The FT reported&nbsp;in September that CloudKitchens was selling warehouses and laid off some real estate employees. CSS's software side has also faced operational bumps. Insider reported in August&nbsp;that some customers complained to salespeople that Otter's software package arrived late and was glitchy, disconnected often, and locked people out of their accounts. In July, a CloudKitchens operator who was invited to speak at an all-hands meeting complained about the software. In response, Otter's global general manager, Guido Gabrielli, a former Uber general manager, sent a Slack message to the full company promising better customer service.Otter originally built a management system to aggregate orders from DoorDash, UberEats, and other delivery platforms, so restaurants could use one tablet to manage all of their orders. The company has since built a point-of-sale system called&nbsp;Mercury&nbsp;that competes with Toast, and it has added other services like revenue recapture, to claw back money for restaurants from customer disputes to delivery platforms. Across its products, Otter is now focusing more on enterprise sales, instead of selling to small restaurants.Do you have a story to share?

A spokesperson confirmed the job cuts, saying the layoffs were done in order to restructure Faire to \"better align our teams with our long-term vision.\"The layoffs were company-wide, Faire said. People in engineering, product, design, and data science were impacted, according to one person familiar with the situation. \"We built our former organizational structure with multiple layers of management to support our pace of hiring. When we slowed down hiring last year, naturally we weren't able to grow into that larger structure,\" the company said.This is the second time in just over a year that the company has laid off workers, although this second restructuring appears to be bigger. It previously laid off about 7% of its workforce last October. Faire had approximately 1,200 employees at the time, The Information reported.Faire is an online marketplace that connects independent brands with retailers that can stock their products in their stores. It was valued at $12.5 billion in May 2022 in a deal where the startup raised a $416 million extension to its Series G. Faire has raised over $1.4 billion since its founding in 2017. Its investors include Dragoneer Investment Group, Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, and Forerunner Ventures. Faire recently announced a partnership with Shopify that established Faire as the preferred wholesale marketplace for Shopify merchants. Shopify's point-of-sale technology is also now the preferred solution for Faire's customers. Shopify also became a shareholder in Faire as part of the deal, which Insider first reported on in July. The size of the investment was not disclosed.\"Our focus remains on being able to consistently support our independent retailer customer community as a reliable partner well into the future. We're thankful for the team members who've contributed to Faire's success so far, and are sad to part ways,\" the company said.Tech companies continue to lay off workers at high rates. According to Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking all of the tech layoffs since the beginning of the pandemic, so far in 2023, more than 247,000 people have been laid off. The e-commerce industry in particular has had to readjust to lower growth rates after seeing online sales soar during the earlier days of the pandemic.

Nomad Health is one of a slew of startups that connects nurses and other clinicians to open jobs. The company said it's getting less business as hospital budgets shrink. Healthcare staffing firm Nomad Health just cut its workforce for the second time this year, as high inflation continues to squeeze hospital budgets. The startup slashed about 25% of its staff, according to two former employees affected by the cuts, as well as at least eight LinkedIn posts by current and former workers.

Staffing platform CareRev cut 33% of its corporate workforce in June, while nurse staffing startup ConnectRN laid off 20% of its workforce and IntelyCare cut about 30 employees in July.\"While demand for contract nurses and allied health professionals remains high, healthcare organizations are grappling with budget shortfalls, which directly impact their immediate staffing demands,\" Maquel Shaw, chief marketing officer at Nomad Health, said in a statement to Insider.She added that the cuts were a \"necessary but painful response\" to those changing demands. Alexi Nazem Alexi Nazem Nomad Health cited similar factors when it slashed 17% of its workforce, or 119 employees, in February.

According to multiple sources familiar with the layoffs, this was not the first time this year SchoolMint has eliminated head count. The company previously cut a similar amount of jobs in March of this year. Sources said 11 open roles are not being backfilled in this latest round as well. Several company-wide initiatives were now \"complete,\" according to official communication about the layoffs from the company to non-affected employees.Before these cuts, there were over 250 employees at SchoolMint, according to sources and LinkedIn data. In a June blog post, SchoolMint listed the total number of employees as 200. The second, more recent round of layoffs took place last week. Affected employees were notified in an email, citing the \"rapidly-changing market\" for the company. This differed from the initial round of layoffs in March, where employees initially received one-on-one phone calls from managers and an HR representative breaking the news, a former employee said. Founded in 2013, SchoolMint was initially venture-backed, receiving seed funding in 2014 from investors like NewSchools Venture Fund, the partners of whom later formed Reach Capital and led SchoolMint's subsequent Series A round. The company also went through the edtech startup accelerator Imagine K-12, which merged with Y Combinator in 2016. In 2017, SchoolMint was acquired by the private equity firm BV Investment Partners.The layoffs at SchoolMint come at an uncertain time for the edtech market, as the sector's pandemic-induced capital boom has seen an increasing slowdown. The first half of 2023 only saw $1.8 billion in global edtech venture funding, less than half of the total for the first half of 2022, which was $4.5 billion, Insider previously reported.Other edtech companies have also faced layoffs this year, including unicorns Paper and Byju's. SchoolMint itself has not been immune to this uncertainty in the broader edtech market. The organization had undergone companywide changes in the past year, including a re-organization of talent, a former employee told Insider. The company moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Lafayette, Louisiana in 2020, and the new offices were completed in May 2023, according to a company blog post.According to Glassdoor reviews on SchoolMint, former employees have been frustrated with the company's multiple re-organizations, especially the increase in workload after the first round of layoffs.\"It's never felt like there's been clarity or transparency,\" a former employee told Insider.

        "Extracted Article": "SoftBank-backed startup Sendoso conducted another round of layoffs on Tuesday.The startup has laid off hundreds of workers over four rounds of cuts in the last 16 months.Amid a difficult funding environment, startups are cutting staff \u2014 sometimes in multiple rounds.SoftBank-backed gifting startup Sendoso laid off an undisclosed number of employees in its latest round of job cuts on Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear how many employees were let go, but workers in engineering, HR, accounting, and customer success posted on LinkedIn that their jobs had been eliminated. One former employee told Insider they were told they were being laid off due to a company restructuring.This is the fourth time in the last 16 months that Sendoso has axed its headcount: the marketing startup in June 2022 laid off around 100 employees from its then 700-employee workforce, Insider previously reported. The 14% staff cuts, which affected workers in both the U.S. and Ireland, came amid a broad wave of tech-industry layoffs resulting from market volatility and pullback in VC funding. The company has done three other rounds of layoffs, according to sources.Representatives for Sendoso and SoftBank did not return Insider's request for comment.Sendoso's platform allows marketing, sales, and HR workers to digitally send gifts to build relationships with clients and employees. Its marketplace includes products like food, alcohol, company swag, and virtual experiences. While it's not clear why Sendoso has resorted to layoffs, many companies have cut back on spending amid economic uncertainty over the last two years. The e-commerce industry in particular has had to readjust to lower growth rates after seeing online sales soar during the earlier days of the pandemic.Sendoso is one of thousands of tech companies laying off workers in the last year and a half. Many startups, specifically, are struggling as VCs continue to dole out less cash following a funding bonanza in 2020, 2021, and the very beginning of last year. VC investment in the first quarter of 2023 was down 53% year over year, according to Crunchbase.As startups can no longer count on their investors to complete a new funding round, many instead are looking inward to cutting costs \u2013 including headcount, most companies' most significant expense. Sendoso most recently raised $100 million in a Series C funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund. The VC-investing arm of Japanese internet investment company SoftBank experienced an abysmal 2022 thanks to failed bets in cryptocurrency exchange FTX and an exodus of senior leaders.While SoftBank has bet big on winners including DoorDash and TikTok parent company ByteDance, the company's VC firm has backed even more colossal failures, including WeWork, Better, and Greensill Capital. It also backed View, a smart-glass company known as one of the worst SPAC deals ever and risks being de-listed by the Stock exchange.Better, which went public in August via a long-delayed SPAC deal, conducted another round of layoffs last month. Other SoftBank-backed startups have cut jobs multiple times, including rapid-delivery startup Gopuff \u2014 which cut workers in April 2022, July 2022, and March 2023 \u2014 and restaurant software company Nextbite \u2013 which also cut jobs twice in 2022 and again in May of this year. Across the entire tech industry, more than 1,000 companies laid off nearly 165,000 workers in 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking all of the tech layoffs since COVID-19. In 2023 so far, that number has ballooned to nearly 240,000 layoffs.Do you have information about job cuts at tech startups?

Starting on October 11, Peloton will also sell co-branded Lululemon apparel as part of the deal. \"As we considered this partnership over the past few months, we knew it was the right step to take given the opportunity to build and extend our community around the world,\" read the internal memo written by Celeste Burgoyne, president of Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon. \"However, the most difficult decision was the impact it would have on our people.\"Wednesday's memo said that Lululemon Studio CEO Mike Aragon, COO Olivia Lange, and Head of Content Kailee Combs would depart the company \"towards the beginning of 2024.\" Burgoyne wrote that Aragon was \"critical in helping lead negotiations for this partnership.\"\"As we move forward, we are focused on how the partnership will elevate our ongoing membership benefits and community experiences for our guests as we connect with this highly engaged community in North America and in key markets around the world,\" Burgoyne wrote.

        "Extracted Article": "Robinhood in June announced plans to acquire no-fee credit card startup X1 for $95 million.Insiders say credit cards are a new focus as Robinhood tries to address a shrinking user base.The company has had ongoing layoffs and is reorganizing internal teams as part of the pivot.Robinhood is laying off more employees and reorganizing teams as part of a new focus on credit cards as the company tries to mitigate a shrinking user base, insiders say. In June, Robinhood announced plans to acquire no-fee credit card startup X1 for $95 million. Insiders say the company is planning to merge X1 with its Robinhood Money organization, the subsidiary focused on cash management and spending features of the app like its debit card, direct deposit, and peer-to-peer payments. Credit cards are much higher-margin products than stock-trading and generally less exposed to volatile markets.A Robinhood spokesperson confirmed after publication that Robinhood made internal changes as a result of the acquisition and laid off what the spokesperson said was a very small number of the 60 employees who joined Robinhood since the acquisition. The company is still hiring and has 200 open roles, the spokesperson said. The changes come as Robinhood tries to address a shrinking user base. Monthly active users, the company reported, decreased by 400,000 to 10.6 million between July and August.\"This has been causing a bit of panic within executive leadership,\" one insider said, adding that X1 is Robinhood's \"latest pivot to try to get out of that rut.\"X1 and Robinhood's future in credit cards were the focus of the company's last all-employee meeting, the person said. Robinhood in June laid off 150 full-time employees in three organizations, according to an internal memo viewed by Insider: customer experience and platform shared services, customer trust and safety, and safety and productivity. The layoff was widely reported, but audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by Insider recently showed ongoing cuts have been deeper.It's unclear when the company made its most recent job cuts. Posts on a private group for people with a Robinhood.com email address on the tech-industry chat app Blind suggests layoffs as recently as Thursday, according to screenshots viewed by Insider.Last week, after Robinhood released its monthly metrics report for August, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note that performance \"seems to once again prove that retail is generally less active in weaker markets as both client engagement and client returns struggled in August.\" However, August is generally slower for user engagement overall, the analysts noted. The Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood has been expanding into other businesses for a couple of years. In 2021, it bought Say Technologies, which connects companies with retail shareholders, for $140 million.\"We started with trading and investing. But more recently, we've been helping customers with their comprehensive set of financial needs,\" Robinhood chief executive and cofounder Vlad Tenev said during an event held by TechCrunch this week. Tenev said he envisions not only allowing people to trade stocks, but \"we can help you save for retirement. And we can help you build up an emergency fund.\"Shares of Robinhood fell nearly 4% on Thursday while the S&amp;P 500 fell nearly 2%. Robinhood stock has fallen 72% since its stock market debut two years ago.

        "Extracted Article": "Better Mortgage went public at the end of August, completing a long-delayed SPAC deal. Execs celebrated with a toast, with one saying they could now \"sleep and breathe easier.\" But the stock dropped and two weeks later the SoftBank-backed startup handed out pink slips. Two days before its highly anticipated stock-market debut, top executives of mortgage startup Better, including CEO Vishal Garg, held an all-hands meeting to celebrate with staff.&nbsp; The stock debut, the result of a long-delayed SPAC merger, would give the company access to $565 million in capital, which Garg, had said would be used to improve the company as it waits for mortgage demand to pick up. Staff were treated to a bubbly toast and assured that the company was finally at the right size to be successful and grow, according to two people who attended the meeting.&nbsp;CFO Kevin Ryan told employees that they could finally \"sleep and breathe easier\" after two years of cutbacks that have reduced the ranks by 91%, according to the two people who attended the meeting, both of whom were Better employees.&nbsp; On its first day of trading on August 24, shares of the newly formed company&nbsp; \u2014 following a SPAC combination with Aurora Acquisition Corp. \u2014 plummeted 93% from where Aurora had traded the day before. (Excluding Aurora's stock price, shares of the Nasdaq-listed Better Home &amp; Finance are down more than 59% from the opening day.)&nbsp;Roughly two weeks later, on September 6, Better laid off about a quarter of its US mortgage sales and origination team, which underwrites the company's mortgage loans, interacts with its customers, and is considered a revenue generator for the company, according to the two employees. The employees, who said they were let go via phone calls, spoke to Insider on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution and concern for their future job prospects.&nbsp;The two former employees say the company now has about 75 employees on the mortgage origination team in the US as well as some employees in India. Better spokeswoman Jessica Schaefer told Insider the company has over 100 people left on the team.&nbsp; At the time of the SPAC merger, Better boasted 950 employees. According to the one laid-off employee, the company used to have 70 managers on the sales team, roughly the amount of total employees left after the layoff.&nbsp;In an emailed statement, Schaefer said that the company plans to replace at least some of the laid-off employees. \"New projections and remarks from chair Jay Powell signal no near-term relief from elevated borrowing costs so the mortgage market will continue to get tougher,\" she said. \"We are hiring more seasoned professionals who can sell in this tough mortgage environment and then making them 10x more productive through our technology.\"Employees were given 30 days of pay, and up to three months of company-provided COBRA coverage, according to two laid-off employees. Garg, who made headlines in 2021 for brutally laying off hundreds of employees via Zoom, told Insider before the deal that the $565 million from the SPAC merger, most of it from a SoftBank convertible note, would allow the company to acquire underperforming mortgage platforms and continue to develop its technological platform, which both laid-off employees praised as the best in the business. Garg also said the money would give the company breathing room to wait out the rough market, and predicted a refinancing boom once interest rates fall.The mortgage industry has been hit hard by rising rates, leading to revenue declines and layoffs across the industry. But Better has been hit particularly hard, dropping from the nation's 10th largest mortgage originator in 2021 to the 59th largest by the first quarter of this year. The company, which posted a $172 million profit in 2020, lost $1.2 billion from 2021 to 2022, and recorded an additional $135.4 million in losses through the first half of this year.&nbsp; Related stories Both former employees told Insider that they were optimistic that the cash infusion might offer some relief after a year of what felt like constant layoffs. One of the employees described a team Zoom meeting where multiple people realized during the call that their Slack had been deactivated, a sign that they were laid off. Those people were able to say goodbye to colleagues before their laptops were shut down remotely, the employee said.&nbsp;"

        "Extracted Article": "Tiger Global-backed software startup Productboard is making another round of layoffs, sources say.The company, dubbed a Salesforce for product managers, was valued at $1.7 billion two years ago.Productboard was a rising star in Silicon Valley, winning over high-profile investors like Sequoia.Productboard, a software startup backed by some of the world's biggest tech investors, has instigated its third round of layoffs less than two years after it became a unicorn, Business Insider understands. The San Francisco-based company, touted as a Salesforce for product managers, was last valued at $1.7 billion in a round led by US hedge fund Tiger Global and Californian investor Dragoneer in February 2022.Since then, the company has conducted a series of layoffs, beginning in November of that year when it cut a fifth of its workforce, two former employees said. Another 10% of its headcount was cut in August last year, they said. Now, Productboard has begun another round of layoffs, the scale of which is unknown as yet, the former staffers said. Others have also spoken about the cuts on LinkedIn.The company did not respond to BI's request for comment.Productboard was founded in 2014 by two engineers from the Czech Republic, Daniel Hejl and Hubert Palan. The company boasts a list of 5,400 customers, including Microsoft, Zoom, UiPath, and Volkswagen. It became a rising star in Silicon Valley, raising $261.7 million from the region's highest-profile investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Index Ventures.Productboard is far from the only pandemic-era star to cull jobs as the economic landscape worsened. Startups and Big Tech companies alike have slashed their wage bills as the high-interest rate environment encourages businesses to prioritize sustainability over growth.In January alone, 76 tech companies have laid off 21,370 employees, according to tracker site Layoffs.fyi. This year's cuts add to the 262,595 job losses announced in 2023. Productboard employed over 500 at its peak in spring 2022, with CEO Palan even telling Bloomberg that the company planned to go public in 2025. Since then, IPOs have become increasingly rare with late-stage companies struggling to find follow-on investment as growth funding disappeared.The startup builds software for product teams to collaborate and incorporate feedback from customers, designers, and managers to ultimately create a better end result. In all, that optimizes workflow.The November 2022 cut at Productboard was deep but justified \u2014 many other startups had faced reductions of up to 15%, and Big Tech had already gone through two rounds of layoffs by then, one former employee told BI. But a different former staffer told BI it instigated a turning point for the company. \"It felt like everything sort of started drying up after the first round of layoffs \u2014 likely due to the market uncertainties; because of this the business felt like changes were required,\" they said.One ex-staffer put consecutive rounds of layoffs down to the slow pace of growth. As a result, the company frequently reorganized, changed priorities, and staffers struggled to show results, they said.LinkedIn now puts Productboard's headcount at 350."

        "Extracted Article": "Adtech layoffs have continued into this summer \u2014 including at some companies that already made cuts. Ezoic, MiQ, Outbrain, and Brightcove are among the adtech companies with recent layoffs. They cite lower ad rates and prolonged uncertainty about the global economy. For some adtech companies, the huge wave of layoffs that struck in 2022 and at the turn of this year wasn't the last, amid prolonged economic uncertainty and a tepid ad market. In the past couple of months, some adtech firms have reduced their head count. In some instances, these were on top of layoffs from months earlier.Ezoic, a publisher-monetization platform, laid off 84 staffers, or about 28% of its workforce, earlier this week. The company had already laid off about 35 workers in December and about 10 more in February, Insider previously reported. The company also shut down its affiliate program this month. In an email to the team also published on its website, Ezoic CEO Dwayne Lafleur wrote that while the company hit record sales in the first half of last year and grew its team by 62% in 2022, this year had been much harder.\"Inflation has skyrocketed, interest rates have risen, crypto markets have crashed, and technology investment and spending have declined,\" Lafleur wrote. \"As a result, ad rates are down nearly 35% from their peak.\"The content-recommendation company Outbrain followed up a small round of layoffs last summer with another reduction in force in June. About 90 employees, or 10% of the company, were affected, Calcalist first reported. A spokesperson for the company, which reported a 9% decline in revenue in the first quarter of the year, said that \"this past year has seen rapid change across our industry and our business\" and that it was working on efficiency, while investing in its growth areas. On May 3, Brightcove \u2014 a video-streaming platform with a recently launched ad-monetization product \u2014 said it would incur charges of between $2 million and $2.2 million related to a 10% reduction of its workforce affecting about 70 people. Brightcove CEO Marc DeBevoise cited \"near-term revenue challenges, including lengthening sales cycles and lower overages and entitlement commitments.\"Also this month, the private-equity-backed adtech firm MiQ shut down its office in Germany and made redundancies in the UK and other markets, which affected about 4% of its employees, the company confirmed. A spokesperson cited challenges related to the global economic downturn.\"In spite of this, our underlying business health remains strong \u2014 and while this is by no means an easy decision \u2014 the careful and intentional steps we're taking to rebalance and streamline our operations will allow us to invest in and sustain company growth now and in the years ahead,\" the spokesperson said. Adtech-industry insiders are also keeping a close eye on the fallout from MediaMath's bankruptcy. After it shuttered operations last month, more than 300 people lost their jobs, and MediaMath owes at least $125 million to hundreds of adtech firms and other companies. (Insider is listed as a creditor in the bankruptcy filings.)Elsewhere, large tech companies such as Meta, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Amazon are still cycling through their own previously announced layoffs in some countries, which has affected advertising employees, people familiar with those companies and individual posts on LinkedIn said.\"There's been a drip of layoffs, and it's really become a year to 'get through' with lead times blowing out\" in terms of contracts being signed, Sasha Auzins, the chief operating officer of the tech and data consultancy Elaboration, said. To be sure, the layoff phenomenon isn't hitting all adtech companies, and many that made cutbacks \u2014 including those listed above \u2014 are aggressively shifting priorities and have open roles listed on their websites.&nbsp;The second half of the year is also traditionally when advertising-funded companies make the bulk of their revenues. The media analyst Brian Wieser wrote earlier this week that several large marketers indicated they were increasing their spending, which signaled that the US advertising market should grow this quarter and \"remains on track towards mid-single digit underlying (ex-political) growth for the full year.\"Adweek recently reported a marked slowdown in adtech job openings in 2023, citing recruiters and industry insiders. But there have been some bright spots. Lee Walker, a UK managing director of Expand Group, which specializes in tech and media recruitment, said his agency's inbound job numbers were up 20% over last month. \"There are some really positive signs,\" he added."

The latest cuts will change how Microsoft approaches customers and partners. Microsoft laid off more than 1,000 employees over the past week, primarily in customer service and sales roles, people familiar with the changes told Insider. The cuts go beyond the 10,000 layoffs Microsoft indicated it was planning earlier this year, according to these people. They asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.&nbsp;As part of these moves, Microsoft shut its \"Digital Sales and Success\" group, a sales and customer service team that at one point had thousands of employees. The company also eliminated the customer solutions manager role, moving some, but not many, employees to another role called customer success account management. Cuts also came to engineering project managers and marketing departments. \"The focus is more to accelerate consumption than it is to help customers,\" one person familiar with the changes told Insider. \"What was promoted as one of the largest customer service groups in the industry is now struggling to keep up with demand.\"It's common for Microsoft to make changes at the start of a new fiscal year, which began July 1.Microsoft leaders have been relatively quiet about the changes this time around. Many managers were left in the dark about the plans, including many who learned of the cuts on the day they were made, two of the people said. Leaders have not broadly provided a rationale for the changes to the sales and customer services teams, which also include significantly reducing travel and expense budgets. Some employees criticized Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff for not providing enough details about the layoffs and changes during the company's sales kickoff event this year, according to internal messages shared with Insider. One internal post about the event included a question about whether the Digital Sales and Success team would be replaced by AI tools.Microsoft reported in a mandatory filing to Washington state that it laid off 210 employees in the state and 66 remote employees, GeekWire reported last week. The people familiar told Insider that the cuts included hundreds more employees.\"Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. \"We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners.\" The layoffs \u2014 along with pausing raises and cutting bonuses and stock awards \u2014 have contributed to falling morale at Microsoft. Less than half of Microsoft employees who answered an internal survey called Daily Signals said they would stay at the company if they received a comparable offer, as Insider recently reported.Do you work at Microsoft or have insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Square Roots told staff it was closing most of its locations and cutting jobs, two former staff said. One farm in Grand Rapids will remain open to service business partners, a source told Insider. Square Roots told local news it plans to reconfigure some locations and may eventually re-open them. Square Roots, a tech farming startup that was cofounded by Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal, shut down the majority of its remaining locations on Tuesday and laid off most of its staff, two employees who were laid off as a result of the closures told Insider. The vertical farming startup was founded in 2016 and quickly grew to five locations, announcing a partnership with Gordon Food Service in 2019. Square Roots grows herbs and salad greens using shipping containers and artificial light and aims to localize food sources, making farming a year-round process.The \"smart farm\" company had over $90 million in total funding as of April 2022, and some of its backers include close friends of Elon Musk, including David Sack's Craft Ventures, according to Pitchbook. Square Roots CEO Tobias Peggs, who cofounded the company alongside Kimbal Musk, notified employees on a Zoom call on Tuesday that the startup would halt production at its locations in Springfield, Ohio, Shepherdsville, Kentucky, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, the two sources said. Kenosha News was the first to report that the Wisconsin location was facing a shutdown and WDRB later confirmed the company planned to shut down four of its farms.A former employee at the company's Grand Rapids location said that they were told one of the two farms at the location had been shut down and the other would stay in use to support the company's new business model.All but about 10 of the workers at the Grand Rapids location, which employed over two dozen staff, were let go, the former worker said. All on-site employees at the other locations were terminated, the other ex-employee said.The exact number of layoffs couldn't be learned. The company was estimated to have around 198 employees as of June, according to PitchBook. \"It was framed as a temporary thing, but the layoffs didn't feel temporary,\" the former Grand Rapids worker said. \"It wasn't like they were saying 'You guys will be offered your jobs back' at any point.\" Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal, cofounded Square Roots alongside CEO Tobias Peggs in 2016. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic The company shut down its original farm in Brooklyn earlier this year, laying off about 50 people at the time, according to a January press release.The recent layoffs came across as a surprise to staff, the ex-employees said. Square Roots had only just opened the Kenosha facility \u2014 its largest yet\u2014 in August and its Shepherdsville location had been operational for less than three months, they told Insider.\"It was just a normal day,\" the former Grand Rapids employee said of the latest layoffs and farm closures announced Tuesday. \"We were in the middle of production and everyone received an email and Slack saying essentially 'Drop everything and attend this Zoom call.' There was really no context as to why this was happening so suddenly and everybody was kind of shocked.\" During the Zoom call, Peggs told employees the company was shifting its focus away from packaging its own product and focusing more on supporting business partners like Gordon Food Services, the ex-staffers said.A spokesperson for Gordon Food Service directed Insider to Square Roots and a spokesperson for the startup did not respond to multiple requests for comment ahead of publication. The company told local news that Square Roots was changing its business model to focus on \"farming as a service.\" Square Roots CEO and cofounder Tobias Peggs showing some of the company's vertical farming containers in New York in 2017. Getty/DON EMMERT \"We're now operating our controlled climate farms exclusively for our strategic partners \u2014 whether that's to immediately secure the supply of high quality crops, or to explore novel ways of profitably growing high calorie food indoors,\" the company told WDRB. \"As we've made this move, we have had to pause commercial production in some of our facilities while we reconfigure them to be more suitable for servicing customers under the Farming as a Service model, and we look forward to bringing these facilities back on line in the future.\" Employees were told they would learn via email shortly after the Zoom call whether their role had been impacted by the farm shut-downs. The Grand Rapids employee said the workers at their location learned they had been laid off after they were abruptly locked out of their work email.\"It was quite abrupt and has been very devastating to this wonderful team of people,\" the former Grand Rapids employee said. \"A lot of us feel like we have to start from ground zero now. There's not a lot of hydroponic startups in Michigan, so it's tough on everybody.\""

Oracle Health includes health IT giant Cerner, which it acquired last year for about $28 billion. Cerner is Larry Ellison's primary focus as he bets on it to prove Oracle's cloud to the world. Oracle on Thursday laid off hundreds of employees, rescinded job offers, and cut back open positions within its health unit, three people familiar with the matter told Insider.

Oracle declined comment.Oracle Health includes health IT giant Cerner, which it acquired last year for about $28 billion. Current and former employees recently told Insider that Oracle has halted raises and promotions and laid off thousands of employees in the unit since the acquisition. Thursday's layoffs were due in large part to Cerner's challenged work with the US Department of Veterans Affairs, which hired Cerner to replace its homemade medical records with Cerner's technology, one of the people told Insider.Work began on the project in 2020 and has been plagued with many fits and starts. Most recently, the VA paused the rollout in April due to issues with the sites where Cerner's records have already been deployed. The VA and Cerner renegotiated their contract in May, allowing the government, per the VA, to hold Cerner more accountable.That situation means Cerner has less government-related work to do and led to this round of cuts, the person said. Cerner is Oracle's largest acquisition, and insiders say it has become a primary focus for chairman and CTO Larry Ellison, who has a vision for a \"revolutionary\" health data system in the cloud for providers and public-health officials to access patient data across organizations and believes the system will prove Oracle's cloud business to the world.Are you an Oracle employee or do you have insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "The venture studio Fractal Software will no longer start new companies, Insider has learned. As a result, the New York firm has laid off a number of recruiters and research analysts. Fractal is now throwing its resources behind its existing portfolio in the midst of a downturn. Fractal Software, a venture studio that creates startups by hatching its own ideas and hiring founders to execute, has laid off staff and will stop starting new companies, Insider has learned. After forming about 130 companies in the span of three years, Fractal now wants to throw its resources behind its existing portfolio, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.This change in focus means the company has no further need for recruiters, who work to enlist potential founders, or investors and research analysts, who are responsible for coming up with the ideas for those founders to pursue. At least 28 employees, about 25% of staff, have left Fractal in the past six months, according to LinkedIn. Fractal confirmed layoffs occurred starting in December, but would not specify the number of employees affected. A person close to the company said it has added new hires to a portfolio support team that gives founders assistance with product, sales, recruiting, and fundraising.The people recently notified of layoffs are staying on until September 1, a spokesperson confirmed. The job cuts follow a round of layoffs in December, which mostly affected the venture studio's recruiters.Fractal has a few more startups in the pipeline, with a goal of launching 145 companies, two people familiar with the company's strategy&nbsp;said. Fractal is still hiring for roles to start those new companies. In a job posting seen by Insider, the venture studio said it was still seeking engineers and operators to fill its \"last few spots.\"&nbsp; \"This may be your last opportunity to start a company through Fractal as this will be the last cohort of companies we launch before we shift 100% of our focus to our portfolio companies,\" the posting said.Fractal appears to be regrouping at a difficult time for startups. The market downturn has made funding for startups harder to come by, particularly for late-stage companies. So as Fractal's startups go out to raise new funds, some are struggling to shore up cash, according to several founders in the portfolio.Fractal's pullback from creating new startups suggests it needs to put time and money into helping its existing companies prosper, before it takes on any additional risk. \"Naturally, having launched so many companies, and having seen the initial success those companies have had, we're eager to ensure they continue to grow for years to come,\" Omri Bloch, chief executive officer of Fractal, told Insider in an email. \"That's why we are moving to our next chapter and focusing our time and resources on the companies we have created and the small business customers they serve.\"An unusual funding structureFounded in 2020, Fractal had been aiming to make it easier for founders to create software firms that target specific industries, a category known as vertical SaaS. Investors had long ignored such startups because they felt their markets were too small to produce an outsized outcome. That's now changed as companies like Procore, Toast, and ServiceTitan show that industry-specific software providers can become multibillion-dollar juggernauts, and changes in buyer behavior give way to new opportunities.Fractal's pitch to founders was to give them a made-to-order business idea and a cofounder to work with. According to founders and former employees, each startup received $1 million through a financial instrument called a simple agreement for future equity or SAFE note, which gave Fractal the right to own certain shares of a startup at the next financing event. It assigned a standard post-money valuation cap of $4 million, which was later raised to $6 million. In recent years, Fractal has produced vertical SaaS startups like scrap recycler software company GreenSpark, which received a Series A investment from Tiger Global in 2021, and behavioral healthcare software startup Ritten, which landed a seed check from 8VC in 2022.Regulatory filings show Fractal had raised $40 million in funding to cover costs like payroll and office space, from backers including Bienville Capital, an asset management firm in New York, and Joe Lonsdale's 8VC. A person familiar with Fractal's finances said it closed an additional $25 million this year.Though, Fractal doesn't use its own money for deals, multiple sources said. Before it had launched the first startup, it entered an agreement with Bienville, one of its investors, that the asset management firm would raise the funds to invest in Fractal's companies, for a slug of equity in each. Bienville had raised two funds to write initial checks into startups and to participate in future financings, growing its stake in those companies that performed well, according to two people with knowledge of the partnership. Regulatory filings show Bienville raised $25.6 million for the first fund and $209 million for the second, though a source familiar with the firm's fundraising efforts said those funds closed higher at $50 million and about $285 million, respectively.Now, Bienville is raising a third fund with a target size of $325 million, the source said. Bienville declined to comment on the fundraise citing rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Related stories 'A job well done'Fractal's pivot came as a surprise to some, but not those at the top. The three people familiar with Fractal's strategy said the venture studio never intended to launch an infinite number of startups, and that it made this clear to its investors and staff. Fractal has a narrow set of parameters for companies it's interested in building, which include the market size, competition, and use of software, one source explained.Fractal now says it's exhausted those opportunities in vertical software, according to sources. The company had spun up more than a hundred companies that now employ a combined 720 people. The layoffs, said one source, is \"representative in many ways of a job well done.\"Yet, several former employees told Insider that they weren't aware of the plan to stop forming new startups, with one adding that they would not have joined the company had they known. \"You could never tell people that and expect them to stay,\" one former employee said.Fractal employees received equity in the portfolio, which vests on a four-year schedule, and those affected by the layoffs will continue to vest all of their equity beyond their employment, a company spokesperson confirmed.Fractal is cutting costs as other venture studios and accelerators face the music. Newchip, an accelerator that helps start companies for a fee, is closing after filing for bankruptcy in March. On Deck, which bills itself as a community for founders, has slimmed down after mass layoffs last year. And Y Combinator, the Coke Classic of accelerators because it takes equity in startups instead of charging a fee for its services, has pulled back from growth investing and laid off 17 employees as capital dries up. Even as Fractal sloughs off the part of the business that creates new startups, a person close to the company insisted that the decision had \"nothing to do with the market environment.\"And it might reverse its decision yet. Two people familiar with Fractal's strategy said the company may decide to launch new startups in the future.Are you a Fractal founder or employee with insight to share?

They will continue to vest their equity after employment, it does not vest immediately."

        "Extracted Article": "Creator economy startup Jellysmack laid off staffers in the US and France on Thursday. 13 employees in the US were impacted by the cuts, the company said. The layoffs in France are still being determined, the company told Insider. The creator economy startup Jellysmack on Thursday laid off staffers in the US and France as part of a larger company restructuring, Insider has confirmed. In an email to Insider, a Jellysmack spokesperson confirmed the news. They said the company was making organizational adjustments and that eliminating these positions was necessary for \"operational efficiency.\"In the US, 13 roles have been impacted, but the number of roles in France is yet to be determined because of a legal process that is expected to take several months, the company said. Jellysmack is also working through a voluntary departure plan, known as Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, in the country. \"Streamlining teams is necessary to position our business for long-term success, address ongoing macroeconomic conditions, and continue adapting to the evolution of social media platforms,\" a Jellysmack spokesperson said&nbsp;in an email to Insider. \"We are committed to supporting all affected employees through their transition.\"This news comes shortly after the creator economy startup began hiring for a new M&amp;A leader to help integrate companies that it buys.Jellysmack, which identifies creator content that can be recut and distributed on platforms like Facebook and Snapchat to make ad revenue, had recently set aside $25 million to invest in kids and family influencers, as part of $500 million it had earmarked to license creator back catalogs. The company partnered with entertainment startup Pocket.watch, a studio that works with popular kids and family entertainment franchises like Ryan's World and Love, Diana. Jellysmack has had several rounds of layoffs in the last year, and laid of staffers in France in February, as The Information reported.Jellysmack sent a company-wide email on Thursday detailing the layoffs. Here's the exact email Jellysmack's president sent all employees, viewed by Insider:&nbsp;From: Sean Atkins Subject: Resetting Our Go-To-Market TeamsToday I am sharing the decision to restructure our go-to-market teams to better serve both our white-glove core businesses and our emerging lighter-touch, higher-volume products. In addition, we will scale down in some countries and reconfigure teams to allocate resources more efficiently. This will result in us saying goodbye to some talented teammates. Although we maintain a healthy financial position, we have reluctantly reached this conclusion as we continue to manage through the ongoing macroeconomic conditions.These are always tough decisions when it impacts our colleagues, especially with the strong work we've done together this year, but it is a critical adjustment we must make as a company to stay focused on areas of success and where we have the best tactical path to pursuing our vision. If you are among those impacted, you will receive a calendar invite to a 1:1 meeting with a manager in your department within the next 2 hours. For employees in France, more details are below. In the meantime, I wanted to provide more context about why we made this decision and how our teams will move forward.Jellysmack go-to-market 2.0Jellysmack's mission has been to help creators go bigger, by bringing them products, services, and infrastructure that helps them grow. We've had numerous successes from our unique Creator Program to Originals to JellyFi - all powered by our Al and technology. As a result, every day we are fortunate to work with top creators who inspire us and reach new heights with our syndication products. That core business has performed exceptionally well since launching, but what has worked historically is no longer as efficient as it once was in today's market. The opportunity across social media platforms has dramatically evolved and requires us to approach the market differently.For example, all the major platforms are chasing TikTok and focusing less and less on traditional long-form videos. From ad-spending to changing algorithms, the rise of short-form video will be a challenging evolution for creators, platforms, and the entire digital media industry.The good news is that we have made immense progress optimizing short-form content; partnering with over 300 top creators across TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Reels. We have also introduced new offerings that are gaining traction and providing more ways for creators to grow, and for us to serve even more creators. But the reality is that this more dynamic business cannot continue to be operated in the same way, with the same go-to-market strategy as our previous syndication product. Our business needs to move beyond a \"one-size-fits-all\" model into a more nimble approach. In a world where we will have white-glove services, financial products, self-serve products, OTT products, merchandise lines, AI editing solutions, and more - our teams are not structured in a manner that is optimized for the realities of these products' go-to-market needs.In order to fix this we need to re-envision our go-to-market team, prioritize speed of impact and take it down to a leaner, customer-focused team that leverages technology for efficiency.What's next for departing employees Our goal for those of you who are leaving is that you are treated with a level of fairness, professionalism, and compassion that matches your valuable contributions to the company.For our impacted US employeesSeverance Pay: We will pay 3 months of severance to departing employees PTO: We will pay for all unused PTO timeHealthcare: We will pay to cover COBRA for 3 monthsLaptops: You will be able to keep your laptop Other Comp: We will pay 50% of pro-rated bonuses and 100% of earned commissionsCareer support: We will connect you with an outplacement agency for career support as well as give you the option to receive support from our in-house recruitersFor our employees in France We have started discussing with our \"Comite Social et Economique\" (the CSE is the equivalent of a Works Council and includes the employee representatives that you have elected). Our shared desire is to come to an agreement that may take the form o a \"Rupture Conventionnelle Collective\" (a voluntary departure plan) and could impact : number of permanent roles in France. We will be working very closely with Employee Representatives to design together a strong support package for those of you who would be eligible to choose to leave Jellysmack's French entity (Keli Network France).Our hope is that we reach an agreement to match the same conditions as our previous agreement. If you are an eligible French permanent employee, you will receive an invitation later today for an All-Hands Meeting on Friday morning (10 am CEST in English and 11:30 am CEST in French) where you will be presented with an overview of the plan and have the option to ask questions.For our impacted employees in other geographies: We will handle terminations in other geographies in accordance with local labor laws and with the same level of support as in each of our main geographies.Moving forward as a teamFor those who are staying, we know this is another unnerving period in a chaotic market. Not only are you saying goodbye to people you've worked alongside, but many of you will be feeling uncertainty about the future. We want you to know that we're making this change to ensure our future is strong and that we are adapting to changes in real-time. There is no doubt that the Creator Era is here to stay. The opportunity for talented storytellers to build brands and businesses on the success of their content and communities will only grow. Jellysmack will be a big part of that journey for creators and the industry.In the coming days, you will be meeting with senior leaders to align on move-forward plans and strategies. I will host an All-Hands on Tuesday, May 30th @ 9:00 AM (PST)/ 6:00 PM&nbsp;(Paris) to provide more context and information.The vision for Jellysmack stays focused on being the best infrastructure partner for creator growth. With a leaner team and a more-diversified portfolio, we will be able to iterate faster, bring products to market sooner, and honor every teammate who helped us get here. I am enthusiastic about our emerging products and the road ahead as we continue to pivot to support our creators - and the industry - as they evolve and grow. I'm confident in this team, the momentum we already have this year, and the speed with which you all are adapting to the opportunities that continue to appear before us.Thanks,Sean"

Last valued at $1 billion, Tractable uses AI to help insurance companies assess damage to cars or homes. The layoffs come despite a broader trend of investors rushing to throw cash at AI startups. Tractable, a startup focused on AI and computer vision, has laid off a chunk of its workforce, the company confirmed to Insider. Founded in 2015 by CEO Alex Dalyac, chief technology officer Razvan Ranca, and ex-president Adrien Cohen, Tractable uses artificial intelligence to analyze photos of damage to cars and homes to help insurers accurately gauge repair costs. The company is primarily based in New York and London.In a statement to Insider, Tractable confirmed that it downsized its teams on two occasions; it cut 10 to 15 staffers in September 2022, followed by a larger cut to its teams in January 2023. The company declined to confirm numbers due to ongoing regional workplace laws, which mean the layoffs process is ongoing in different countries. In total, the reductions spanned seven countries.&nbsp; \"Letting go of team members is always a painfully difficult decision to make, but like many tech companies, we have had to adapt as markets and VCs move from rewarding growth regardless of losses, to rewarding profit,\" a Tractable representative told Insider. \"Taking these steps allowed us to prepare for a challenging economic environment and to position ourselves for strategic growth in 2023.\"Like many of its growth-stage peers, Tractable benefited from tech's bull run in 2021, cinching a $60 million Series D from New York-based private equity firm Insight Partners and Toronto-based venture firm Georgian. The round valued the company above $1 billion.But the startup has not been immune to the effects of the global tech downturn, which has culled VC investment into startups and seen tech firms layoff almost 200,000 employees globally in 2023, per layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi.&nbsp; Asked if the company has retained its $1 billion-plus valuation, the representative told Insider: \"Tractable was valued at $1 billion the last time we raised funds in June 2021.&nbsp;\"The entire tech market is now valued at different revenue multiples than in mid-2021 and Tractable is no exception.\"And as is common in growth-stage companies, Tractable remains loss-making, according to accounts for its UK entity filed with Companies House for the year ended December 2021, covering Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa but excluding the Americas. The UK entity lost \u00a315.7 million (around $19.4 million) on revenue of \u00a313.2 million (around $16.2 million), steeper than its loss of \u00a36.7 million (around $8.2 million) on revenue of \u00a38.7 million (around $10.8 million) the prior year. The growing losses were partly down to a near-doubling of the startup's administrative expenses year on year, which include staffing costs.In its 2021 financials, Tractable stated that the firm could continue operating as a going concern even if its losses continue, due to a $40 million revolving credit facility. Additional filings with Companies House in late 2022 list the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as a lender. Tractable declined to comment on whether it had raised further equity or debt financing.The layoffs come despite increased investor appetite for startups developing AI, fueled by the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. &nbsp;During the first three months of 2022, investors poured $24.1 billion into AI and machine learning startups; that traction has held a year on, with AI and machine-learning startups bagging $25.2 billion, according to Dealroom.&nbsp;"

        "Extracted Article": "Oracle spent about $28 billion to acquire health IT giant Cerner last summer. Insiders say Oracle has since cut costs significantly, such as pausing raises and laying off 3,000. Leadership changes and workforce cuts have made a critical project more challenging, they said. Since buying health IT giant Cerner for about $28 billion, Oracle has halted raises and promotions and laid off thousands of employees in the unit, four current and former employees told Insider. After the acquisition closed in June, Oracle has laid off more than 3,000 of the 28,000 original Cerner employees, one of the people said. It also has not issued raises or granted promotions, and, earlier this year, announced that workers shouldn't expect any through 2023, two of them said.&nbsp;Layoffs, which have occurred as recently as this month, have affected workers across teams, including marketing, engineering, accounting, legal, and product, a former employee said. Oracle declined to comment. While such restructuring is common after a company acquires another the size of Cerner, between the cuts, wage freezes, and Oracle selling Cerner's buildings in Kansas City \u2014 where Cerner has historically been a major employer \u2014 morale within the Cerner workforce is \"terrible,\" a former Cerner executive told Insider.The unit has also seen significant leadership turnover.Dr. David Feinberg, tapped to lead Cerner as CEO prior to the Oracle acquisition, has been sidelined in a largely \"ceremonial\" role, a former employee with knowledge of the matter said. According to his LinkedIn, Feinberg left the CEO role in September before becoming \"chairman\" of Oracle Health. Feinberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Soon after the acquisition closed, Ellison brought in Don Johnson \u2014 the former Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) boss once named by Ellison as a potential contender for co-CEO \u2014 to run engineering for a combined unit called Oracle Health and AI. Johnson abruptly left the post in January.After Johnson left, Oracle moved data and artificial-intelligence back under its cloud business. Oracle's vice president of AI and data-science services, Elad Ziklik, wrote in an email viewed by Insider at the time that the team would \"absolutely continue to focus on healthcare, and this will remain one of our top priorities across the org.\"Internally, the face of the unit appears to be Oracle Health General Manager Travis Dalton, who has been in charge of all-hands meetings. Cerner is Oracle's largest-ever acquisition, and insiders say it has become a primary focus for cofounder Larry Ellison, who has a vision for a \"revolutionary\" health data system in the cloud for providers and public-health officials to access patient data across organizations.&nbsp;That grand vision is already facing its first test. Oracle Health is in charge of a contract worth several billion dollars to overhaul the US Department of Veterans Affairs' information systems. The VA last month paused the rollout, which has moved at a glacial pace since starting in 2020, to fix issues at five sites already using the system.Do you have tips about Cerner or the VA rollout?

Those cut included top salespeople and creative executives, LinkedIn posts suggest. Layoffs hit newsletter publisher TheSkimm for the second time this year as it continues to face a punishing advertising market. Two knowledgeable sources said 22 people were cut, or about 13% of the workforce. The round appears to have included an EVP of sales, VP of national sales, and the creative director, according to LinkedIn posts of recent days. Insiders called it a \"mass layoff\" and \"bloodbath.\"TheSkimm employed about 150 people after January layoffs, when it cut about 10% of its staff, or 17 people. The cuts came amid a tough economic environment in which a wide range of media, entertainment, and tech companies have laid off staff. Digital publishing insiders have variously told Insider that they'd seen advertising revenue decline 15% to 30% year over year in the first quarter.Founded by Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg in 2012, New York-based TheSkimm took off on the popularity of its newsletter, the Daily Skimm, aimed at millennial women. Over the years, TheSkimm raised over $28 million from investors including GV (Google Ventures) and RRE Ventures, as well as prominent individuals like Spanx founder Sara Blakely, Shonda Rhimes, and Mariska Hargitay. The funding has fueled its expansion into podcasting, personal finance and lifestyle newsletters, virtual courses, and video production.The company hasn't raised funding since 2018, and industry insiders said it was looking for a buyer and new investment as its growth slowed. The company faced tough times in the pandemic when advertisers were spending less and reassessing which media outlets were truly essential, and TheSkimm's lighthearted tone felt out of step with the times. TheSkimm has also struggled to diversify its revenue sources, industry insiders said."

It follows an earlier round of layoffs in August last year, which reduced its then-headcount by 12%. Permutive said it wants to focus on profitability amid a challenging economic environment and drop in venture funding. UK-based adtech company Permutive this week announced a layoff that is expected to affect just under 80 staffers, or about 40% of its headcount, Insider has learned. Staffers in the company's UK office have now entered a formal consultation process. UK employment laws stipulate employers laying off more than 20 staff must consult with employee representatives over redundancy plans. Permutive said it would conduct similar processes for international employees, in compliance with local laws.The company said the decision reflected prolonged challenges in the economy. A Permutive spokesperson said the company couldn't comment on the numbers or divisions affected. \"Late-stage venture capital has fallen by 80%, and as we chart a course for responsible growth, we've decided to prioritise profitability and double down on our existing customers,\" wrote Permutive CEO Joe Root in a blog post published after Insider requested comment from the company.This week's announcement followed an earlier round of layoffs in August, which affected 30 roles. At the time, CEO Joe Root said the company had over-hired in certain areas \"ahead of revenue.\"Ad businesses ranging from big tech giants to smaller startups have been affected by a deceleration in digital ad spending in 2022 and 2023, prompting a wave of layoffs and other cost-cutting measures across the space. It followed a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021 that didn't retain its velocity when consumer behavior returned to normal. Rising interest rates and inflation have also driven up costs for businesses, while venture capital funding has plunged. Permutive has raised $105 million in funding to date. It counts SoftBank, EQT Ventures, and Octopus Ventures among its investors.The company works with publisher clients like Insider, The Economist, and Cond\u00e9 Nast to organize their audiences into anonymized cohorts for advertisers to target. It also offers data clean room technology that helps advertisers and publishers match their data in a privacy-controlled environment.\"The changes we make today will see us focus on the capabilities our customer base needs now and what they will need in future to get ahead of industry changes,\" said Root in the blog post."

The company, which runs influencer-marketing campaigns, has raised $145 million. Grin, a marketing platform used by brands to run sponsored campaigns with influencers on social media, is the latest creator-economy startup to lay off employees. On Tuesday, the company laid off a number of staffers across its marketing, engineering, and other teams, according to multiple people close to the company.Grin did not respond to multiple requests for comments about the nature and scope of the layoffs. This is the company's second round of layoffs in recent months. In November, a spokesperson for Grin confirmed the company had laid off 60 staffers. Those November layoffs, which affected about 13% of its staff, mostly impacted staffers in Grin's sales department, the spokesperson said at the time.Three former Grin staffers laid off on Tuesday, who spoke with Insider on the condition of anonymity to protect career prospects, said they were logged out of both Slack and email on Tuesday. A fourth former staffer said after the memo was sent, some staffers received communication from their direct manager, adding that they were told this round of layoffs was \"significantly larger\" than the last round, and that the cuts were \"not totally surprising given the state of Grin's business and the economy at large.\" The identities of the four employees are known to Insider.\"There was a memo sent on Slack, but halfway into reading it, my Slack account got deactivated, which is when I knew I was going to be a part of it,\" the first former staffer said. \"All departments were impacted, from individual contributors, managers, and directors. But the sales team took a really brutal hit.\" A second former staffer said they were also caught off guard by the cuts.&nbsp;\"I do feel hurt by the cuts,\" the third former staffer said. \"I feel like my team in general pulled all nighters and weekend hours to get a critical project done. To know that we put in this much work and some of us were cut seemed very unfair and unexpected.\"The influencer-marketing software company has raised a total of $145 million to date, per Crunchbase data. The company was founded&nbsp;by former Red Bull marketing manager Brandon Brown in 2014. Grin provides software that helps e-commerce brands access influencers, artists, athletes, and more, for marketing campaigns. Grin is among a slew of creator-economy startups that have laid off employees recently, including Spring and Faze Clan."

        "Extracted Article": "French retail marketplace startup Ankorstore is set to cut a significant amount of roles, sources said. The Tiger Global-backed company has raised 365 million euros (around $387 million) to date. It is the latest high-profile Tiger Global startup to slash jobs, following on from Stripe and Getir. Ankorstore, a $2 billion marketplace startup that counts US investing giant Tiger Global among its biggest backers, is set to cut a substantial amount of its workforce, sources say. The Paris-based company, which was founded in 2019 by veterans of Etsy and Vestiare Collective, has built a wholesale platform that connects independent shop owners with retailers. France's Ankorstore has raised 365 million euros (around $387 million) to date and is also backed by Coatue and Index Ventures.The company is currently undergoing a sizable reorganization that will result in job cuts, four Paris-based venture capitalists and another London-based source told Insider. The cuts could result in around half of Ankorstore's workforce leaving the business, inclusive of a cut of around 20% of staff last October, one industry source estimated. Ankorstore employed around 400 people in February 2022 but LinkedIn estimates that around 600 people currently work at the startup.A post referencing the reorganization has appeared on LinkedIn while over a dozen Ankorstore staffers have set their profiles to \"Open for Work.\"A spokesperson for Ankorstore said the company was unable to comment on the matter. 2023 has been a busy year for tech layoffs after a difficult 2022, as companies look to cut costs and rein in burn amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment. So far in 2023, more than 450 tech companies have laid off more than 120,000 staff, according to the tracker site Layoffs.fyi.Investment firm Tiger Global had been a major pandemic startup investor, with a particular uptick in European deals through 2021.&nbsp;In keeping with the broader downturn in the sector, many of those well-funded startups are now slashing jobs. Others in Tiger's portfolio reducing headcount include Stripe, Checkout, Getir, and Messagebird.Ankorstore competes with US rivals like Faire, which was last valued at $12.59 billion and expanded into Europe in 2021. Faire also cut 7% of its 1,200-person workforce in November, The Record reported. Usually, smaller retailers struggle to compete with bigger players because the brands they want to showcase will have a high minimum order requirement. Ankorstore effectively acts as the middleman with a minimum order of 100 euros (around $106), allowing smaller retailers to buy a greater variety of stock. Brands are then charged a commission on sales by Ankorstore.Speaking in February 2022, Ankorstore cofounder Nicolas Cohen said the company had to move \"very fast\" and that while it wasn't operating in a \"winner takes all market,\" there was definitely a first-mover advantage.&nbsp; The startup says it works with around 200,000 retailers and some 15,000 brands.Got a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "Cerebral plans to cut 15% of its staff, or 285 employees, Insider has learned. It's the mental-health startup's third round of layoffs in less than a year. Cerebral has been struggling to stay afloat following scrutiny of its prescription practices. Mental-health startup Cerebral is laying off 15% of its workforce, or about 285 employees, as the company reels from a tumultuous year of public scrutiny and federal investigations into its prescribing practices. CEO Dr. David Mou told employees in a February 27 email that the cuts are necessary for Cerebral to maintain a sustainable business \"to ensure we can continue to provide care to our patients in need,\" according to a copy seen by Insider.In an email to Insider confirming the layoffs, a Cerebral spokesperson said the decision is the culmination of Cerebral's efforts to reorganize the company to \"refocus on the most important service offerings for our patients.\"&nbsp; It's Cerebral's third round of layoffs in less than a year. The company previously cut about 350 employees between June and July, according to Bloomberg News. It slashed an additional 20% of its workforce in October, the Wall Street Journal first reported, which Insider confirmed.The startup provides mental-health services for issues like anxiety and depression, and has been focusing in recent months on improving care for people with serious mental illnesses, per Insider's reporting in November.Last year, Cerebral came under fire for how it prescribed controlled substances, including stimulants like Adderall, that can be addictive. Insider first reported in May that the&nbsp;Drug Enforcement Administration&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Department of Justice were investigating Cerebral's prescribing practices. It has since stopped prescribing many of those controlled medicines. The February layoffs will take place \"over the next several weeks,\" according to a separate email to laid-off employees&nbsp; from Cerebral's human resources team. Impacted employees will be notified through March 1, per Mou's email to Cerebral staff.The company's severance package for laid-off employees includes ten weeks of separation pay, full benefits through the end of April including health insurance coverage, and up to six months of Cerebral's behavioral health services, according to Mou's email. Related stories Cerebral's rocky futureIn 2021, Cerebral called itself the fastest-growing mental-health company. The startup banked $300 million in a December 2021 round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, skyrocketing to a $4.8 billion valuation. But problems began cropping up as Cerebral tried to grow too fast. Nurses working for Cerebral told reporters they felt pressured to prescribe medications like Adderall after short visits with patients.Insider reported in June that Cerebral had put hundreds of patients at risk, based on more than 2,000 incident reports by employees flagging concerns about patient care.&nbsp;In May, Cerebral ousted then-CEO Kyle Robertson and handed the reins to Mou, who previously served as Cerebral's chief medical officer. In a statement to Insider in December, a spokesperson for Cerebral said that the company is not fighting for its survival, and that the company is using technology to advance behavioral health, including by measuring clinical outcomes with surveys.Cerebral's pharmacy of choice, Truepill, has also been affected by Cerebral's troubles. The DEA said in December that it may revoke Truepill's ability to fill controlled substances, citing allegations that the online pharmacy startup unlawfully dispensed controlled substances for online mental-health startups like Cerebral.Do you have a tip about Cerebral that you want to share?

Betterment told employees that rising operating costs and market volatility impacted the firm. Betterment's CEO said in a memo that the firm tightened spending and slowed hiring last year. The digital wealth management firm Betterment is laying off 28 employees, according to an email its chief executive officer sent to the company on Wednesday. \"You've all experienced the very difficult market conditions throughout 2022, and the outlook for the economy in 2023 is mixed at best. Our business is not immune to the effects of this volatility, or to the record levels of inflation that have pushed operating costs up for Betterment in all areas,\" Sarah Levy said in the email that Insider obtained.The robo-advisor laid off employees in roles across the organization, including in marketing, sales, and engineering roles, a person familiar with the matter said. In an Insider story about Betterment published in August 2022, the company said it had 450 employees. A Betterment spokesperson declined to specify how many employees the company has now and which roles were impacted. Betterment, which has its headquarters in New York City, is also in the process of closing its Philadelphia office and sub-leasing a floor in its offices in New York, Levy said. The spokesperson confirmed the company's plans to Insider. The spokesperson said the Philadelphia office space is small, but declined to specify how many employees worked there.&nbsp;Levy, who took over as CEO in late 2020 from cofounder Jon Stein, said the company had also tightened spending and slowed hiring last year. \"While our hard work has helped, it makes business sense to further reduce expenses through headcount reductions,\" she wrote in the Wednesday memo.&nbsp;The moves reflect the challenges that companies across the finance, technology, media industries, and beyond have weathered after a brutal year for the public and private markets. US-based firms as varied as BlackRock, Disney, PayPal, and Amazon have laid off employees as the economy has slowed. The overall health of Betterment, which oversees $32 billion of assets under management for 775,000 customers as of December, is tethered to market fluctuations. The company makes money in part from fees it charges clients to handle their investments. In recent years it has aimed to diversify its business lines by expanding its business-to-business offerings, where it can charge higher fees than with individual investors.&nbsp;The company's investors include the private-equity firm Francisco Partners, Citi's venture-capital arm, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Swedish investment firm Kinnevik. Betterment last raised capital in late 2021, a Series F round that valued it at $1.3 billion. It made two acquisitions \u2014 the US business of Canadian competitor Wealthsimple, and a crypto startup called Makara \u2014 in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp;\"Building something durable and sustainable ultimately takes a long time,\" Levy told Insider an interview last year. \"But we felt that just being what we historically called 'the robo' probably wasn't enough to be a stand-alone entity long term.\" Levy told employees on Wednesday that benefits to laid-off staff, in addition to severance and healthcare insurance continuation, would include removing the equity vesting cliff for employees who worked at Betterment for less than one year. She also said that because of the access employees have to customers' financial data, \"we had to turn off access to internal systems right away for those impacted.\"Do you work at Betterment?

        "Extracted Article": "Nearly all staff at adtech firm EMX Digital were laid off this week after parent company Big Village filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Former staffers are angry they didn't get severance, after a round of layoffs last year included severance. Big Village owes millions to media giants like Google, NBCUniversal, and Hulu, according to filings. When ad agency holding company Big Village filed for bankruptcy, it laid off nearly all of the roughly 100 staffers at its adtech firm EMX Digital this week, many without severance, according to four people who were impacted. The mass layoffs caught people by surprise, these former employees told Insider. They said that they were told late last year that Big Village was close to finding a buyer. One person told Insider that they had expected a deal to be finalized by January.But during a company meeting earlier this week, employees were told that Big Village filed for bankruptcy because its private equity owner Lake Capital Partners couldn't find a buyer, according to three people at the meeting. Big Village, EMX Digital, and Lake Capital Partner did not respond to a request for comment.Employees were also shocked by the mass layoffs because they had assumed that a round of cuts last fall had put the company in a better position, two people said. And while the people cut last year got severance, those laid off this week did not, according to three people impacted.\"To me, that is pretty inhumane,\" one person said. \"Even if they were trying to find a buyer, they certainly weren't making employees at the front of their minds.\" The former employees said that they were also frustrated and surprised by the quick exit of Big Village's global CEO Kasha Cacy earlier this month. On February 1, some employees learned that Cacy was leaving Big Village after an Ad Age story was published about her new role as chief media officer at ad agency Known.\"It seemed like the ship was sinking, and she jumped ship first,\" said one former employee. \"Whatever happened, it happened under Kasha's watch, and she was the first to leave.\"Despite leaving the company, Cacy led EMX Digital's meeting this week about layoffs, said a second former employee.&nbsp; EMX Digital's CEO Michael Zacharski also recently left the company but was not part of the meeting, that person said.\"Last week, we were told that things were being dealt above his head,\" said a third former employee.A small staff and part of EMX Digital's business that handles managed services with advertisers has been acquired by adtech firm Zeta Global, according to two former employees. Zeta Global declined to comment for this story. Cacy and Zacharski did not respond to a request for comment.EMX Digital got backlogged on payments to publishersTwo of the former EMX Digital employees said that financial problems started last summer, after Big Village rebranded from Engine Group. Lake Capital Partners had recently sold the European arm of Engine Group to consultancy Next Fifteen Communications Group for about $100 million, so the US arm changed its name to differentiate itself.There were internal rumors that this was when Lake Capital Partners started looking for a buyer for Big Village, according to two former employees. At the same time, EMX Digital stopped paying publishers, and between July and September, EMX Digital was bombarded by emails from publishers who were getting increasingly mad about missed payments, said one former employee. Some of the missed payments came from longtime clients, stretching back to 2015 and 2016.\"It was like a snowball effect,\" this person said.In October and November, staffers were told that the payment issues would be fixed, but by December, it was clear that the payment issues were spiraling, this person said. \"With every month that passed it got bigger and bigger,\" this person said.According to the Chapter 11 filing, Big Village has between 5,001 to 10,000 creditors, particularly large media companies that it owes for buying ads. The documents cite $10 million to $50 million in estimated assets for Big Village, and estimated liabilities are between $50 million to $100 million.Big Village's 30-biggest creditors include Yahoo (which is owed $2.8 million), Google (owed $1.7 million for search ads), and Hulu (owed more than $700,000), according to the filing. Other top creditors include Viacom's Pluto TV, Samsung Electronics, and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp; EMX Digital is the latest adtech company to be hit by big layoffs as advertisers rethink their spending during an economic downturn. Also this week, Yahoo laid off half of its adtech staff, equivalent to 1,600 people.To get in touch with Insider's Lauren Johnson, email ljohnson@businessinsider.com or follow her on Twitter at&nbsp;@LaurenJohnson."

        "Extracted Article": "Medly is shutting down for good in February, after declaring bankruptcy in December. The pharmacy startup sold its patient data and drug inventory to Walgreens on Tuesday. Medly burned through cash as it tried to grow too fast, Insider reported in November. Medly is permanently closing its doors in February as the once-hot pharmacy startup's run comes to a turbulent end. Medly told its remaining employees in an email Tuesday afternoon obtained by Insider that its 22 pharmacies will officially close after Thursday, and all of its staff will be let go by the end of the month. The company, which once hoped to disrupt giants like Walgreens and CVS with its app to help patients manage prescriptions and deliveries in addition to its in-person stores, sold its pharmacy data and inventory to Walgreens on Tuesday in a bankruptcy auction.&nbsp;The startup's sudden shutdown comes after months of chaos for Medly, which declared bankruptcy in December. The pharmacy company burned through cash as it tried to grow too fast, Insider reported in November, showing just how difficult it is to make it big in an industry with low margins and fierce competitors. Medly's retail stores will shut on February 25, the company told staff in the same email. Because Walgreens bought Medly's pharmacy inventory and not Medly's retail inventory, the company said it will attempt to sell its remaining over-the-counter goods in stores before they close and online through its website.The online sales will continue through March 31, at which point Medly's distribution center will close down, per the email.Medly had originally planned to sell its store leases and other assets, including that retail inventory, Medly's lawyer said during Tuesday's bankruptcy hearing. But Walgreens didn't bid on those leases.&nbsp;Medly did not respond to a request for comment. The company said it will not pay severance to the employees it's letting go due to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.&nbsp;Medly's chief people officer told employees in a separate email that Walgreens had expressed interest in interviewing Medly employees to work for the pharmacy giant. The startup referred its staff to Walgreens' open job listings. Related stories Months of turmoil come to a headFormer employees told Insider in November that Medly was crumbling under mounting losses as the pharmacy startup blew through cash. The company, which last raised $100 million in venture capital in 2020, posted losses of $35 million in the first half of the year even before accounting for expenses like interest and taxes, according to a company presentation obtained by Insider.In June 2022, the startup was operating 51 stores and serving 32,000 patients, according to that same presentation. But Medly ultimately closed down nearly half of those stores and laid off about 1,100 of its 1,900 employees in August.Medly closed many of its pharmacies without notifying patients, leaving many patients stranded without necessary medications, according to former patients and employees. Walgreens will pay $19.35 million to Medly for its patient data, pharmacy inventory, and intellectual property, according to a February bankruptcy filing, helping Medly to settle some of its debts. December bankruptcy filings showed Medly owed millions of dollars to other drug and software companies, including nearly $10 million to the pharmaceutical wholesaler Cardinal Health."

The layoffs come as the tech industry saw more than 84,000 jobs cut in January. The VC-backed unicorns Clari and Workato both laid off employees abruptly in the past week, Insider has learned, capping a brutal start to 2023 for the tech industry. Clari's layoffs caught the startup's staffers off guard, according to one employee Insider spoke to.&nbsp; Clari, a buzzy revenue-software startup valued at more than $2.6 billion, whose backers include Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures, and Blackstone, cut more than 20 roles following a previous round of layoffs in August, according to a former employee who spoke to Insider, and multiple LinkedIn posts authored by former staffers.Workato, an automation-software startup that was last valued at $5.7 billion, laid off 10% of its workforce, or about 90 employees, a company spokesperson confirmed to Insider. It now has 824 employees globally following the job cuts. Clari and Workato are among the latest entrants in a long list of startups that have slashed jobs in the first few weeks of the year, including Carta, Bolt, Scale AI, Vial, Miro, and Chainalysis. They joined large tech companies such as Salesforce and Amazon, which each trimmed thousands of employees from their payrolls.The hefty number of layoffs indicate that 2023 hasn't put a halt to the carnage in the tech industry. Altogether, tech companies shed nearly 160,000 jobs last year, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Yet in the first few weeks of 2023, the industry has already slashed more than half that total, with more than 84,000 employees laid off in January and more than 3,700 in the first few days of February.Growing too fastWorkato has raised a total of $420 million in funding from investors such as Battery Ventures, Tiger Global Management, and Insight Partners. As startups and investors began bracing for an economic slowdown last year, Workato's leadership team began emphasizing a push toward profitability in its quarterly update meetings with staff, a former employee told Insider. Over the past two years, the company's revenue nearly doubled, but so had its staff, they said. \"I knew that some things were getting tight, and they were readjusting expectations, but I didn't realize it was going to come with a head-count reduction,\" the former employee said.Though the layoffs were unexpected, the former Workato employee said they appreciated the way the company delivered the news. An executive held one-on-one video calls with the affected members of the employee's team, rather than delivering the news in a company-wide missive or an all-hands meeting. The layoffs cut across several teams, the former employee said. Related stories Caught off guardClari, by contrast, delivered its layoff news in a&nbsp;group&nbsp;Zoom meeting for those affected. The layoffs caught staffers off guard, a former employee told Insider, given that employees had posted on LinkedIn just a few weeks ago about the company's strong hiring despite the broader turmoil in the tech industry. But despite raising $225 million in a round of funding announced in January 2022, Clari has shown signs of waning momentum over the past year. Its recent layoffs are its second round of job cuts within a year: The company slashed about 40 jobs in August, the former employee said. This time around, the company's go-to-market team bore the brunt of the layoffs. For several quarters, Clari had been struggling with lagging sales, the former employee said.A spokesperson for Clari could not be reached for comment.The former Clari employee Insider spoke with said that the spate of layoffs had prompted them to reconsider their dedication to the tech industry. \"I feel optimistic about it, but at the same time, I'm hedging my bets,\" the former employee said. \"I'm looking at possibly doing consulting, for instance, and getting out of tech in general. It's a little too soon, but over the next weeks and months, if the momentum doesn't really pick up with tech, maybe I'll go a different route.\"Correction: February 9, 2022 \u2014 The story has been updated to reflect that Clari's layoffs were conducted in a group Zoom meeting for those affected."

        "Extracted Article": "Getir laid off roughly 100 US corporate employees this week, Insider has learned. The layoffs come as Getir combines operations with Gorillas, which could lead to store closures. Getir's US arm has struggled to pay store employees properly and held them to strict time goals. Rapid grocery-delivery startup Getir has laid off about 100 corporate employees, Insider has learned. The company made the cuts earlier this week, and they affected employees on several teams, including Getir's legal, operations, HR, fleet, and finance departments, a source familiar with the details told Insider. Before the layoffs, Getir's Slack channel for US employees contained roughly 260 corporate employees. Afterward, that number was about 160, according to the source, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.More cuts could be on their way at Getir's stores as the company combines its US network with that of Gorillas, another rapid-delivery startup, and eliminates overlapping locations, the source said. Getir uses small storefronts to fill orders and deliver them to customers close by, using bikes and scooters. In November, Getir reached a deal to acquire Gorillas, Insider reported. The acquisition closed for $1.2 billion, a steep discount to Gorillas' 2021 valuation of $3 billion. The companies haven't yet combined their teams at the corporate or store level.Getir did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.One employee said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that layoffs had happened. \"My time at Getir has come to an end,\" she wrote. \"Like several of my colleagues, I was notified my position was eliminated.\" The layoffs are the latest challenge for Getir, which delivers groceries and other essentials in as few as 10 minutes. The company laid off 14% of its workforce last May, the New York Post reported.&nbsp;In 2022, Insider reported on the conditions that Getir employees faced filling and delivering orders at the company's US stores. Workers risked being terminated for not meeting strict time limits, such as packing orders in less than two minutes, as well as trips to the hospital after accidents riding the company's electric bikes and scooters to delivery orders.Getir also struggled to pay store employees in full and on-time, several told Insider. That prompted an investigation from New York state's Department of Labor. The most recent job cuts were spread across different teams at Getir, the source familiar with the layoffs said. They also swept out many high-performing employees, some of whom had helped build Getir's business since it launched in the US in late 2021.\"What a lot of people are thinking is that they're getting ready to pull out of the US market altogether,\" the source said. \"They're trying to save money. It looks like they're getting down to a skeleton crew.\"In January, Getir appointed Kristof Van Beveren as its first US general manager, Insider reported. Van Beveren previously served as Getir's UK general manager and was founder and CEO of UK grocery delivery service Weezy. Getir acquired Weezy in 2021. Before entering the US, Getir built its businesses in densely populated European cities such as Istanbul, London, and Amsterdam. Even in those markets, Getir and its rivals have struggled to achieve profitability.&nbsp;The US presented additional challenges for Getir. Customers were used to buying all their groceries at once instead of making smaller daily trips, and the company had to build its operations from the ground up instead of relying mainly on acquisitions of similar businesses as it had done in Europe, analysts and former employees told Insider in 2022."

        "Extracted Article": "Newsletter publisher and digital media company TheSkimm laid off nearly 10% of staffers in January. The last major round of layoffs at TheSkimm, which targets young women readers, was in 2020. Bustle Digital Group, The Washington Post, and Buzzfeed are among other media companies that cut workers in recent months. TheSkimm, the popular newsletter publisher and digital media company, laid off nearly 10% of its workforce \u2014 or about 17 staffers \u2014 in mid-January, according to a source familiar with the matter. The cuts came amid a tough economic environment that has seen hundreds of layoffs at a wide range of news and media companies, and impacted writers, editors, producers, and marketers within the TheSkimm.&nbsp;Founded by Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg in 2012, New York-based TheSkimm first captured the attention of readers with its newsletter, the Daily Skimm, which caters to millennial women. The company describes itself as being \"dedicated to succinctly giving women the information they need to make confident decisions.\"&nbsp; Over the last decade, TheSkimm has expanded into podcasting, personal finance and lifestyle newsletters, virtual courses, and an in-house, full-service video production team. According to the company's website, its investors include GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Disney, RRE Ventures, and Homebrew Ventures.The company has seven open positions listed on its careers site, including postings for a chief financial officer and VP of commerce.&nbsp;TheSkimm last engaged in a major round of layoffs in the spring of 2020, just a few months into the start of the pandemic, axing about 20% of its 130-person staff. Zakin and Weisberg told staffers at the time, shortly before the layoffs, that the economic downturn had sent ad proposals plummeting 75%.&nbsp; TheSkimm is far from the only media company that has enacted wide-ranging personnel cuts in recent months. The Washington Post, Bustle Digital Group, BuzzFeed, Gannett, Dow Jones and People magazine parent Dotdash Meredith have all laid off staffers. Publications including Protocol and Gawker have been shuttered or suspended. Entertainment media companies have also been heavily impacted, with AMC, NBCUniversal, Paramount Global, Roku, and Spotify paring back headcount."

        "Extracted Article": "TikTok has laid off employees on its human-resources team focused on talent acquisition and recruiting. The move comes during a brutal week in tech as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google cut thousands of staff. The scale of TikTok's layoffs, which occurred earlier this week, wasn't immediately clear. TikTok initiated a new round of layoffs this week, letting go of staffers who worked in talent acquisition and recruiting at the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. Impacted employees were informed on Wednesday, the sources said. A handful of people&nbsp;who identified themselves as TikTok employees also posted about the layoffs on LinkedIn. Insider was unable to immediately determine the scale of the layoffs.TikTok has cut employees on multiple occasions in the past year. In August, the company trimmed its advertising team in North America in a push to reorganize its sales, ad operations, and account-management employees into industry-specific verticals. In December, the company laid off a significant portion of its Russian workforce, many of whom were working in its Eastern Europe division, as it evaluated the evolving circumstances in the region following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, also laid off hundreds of employees at the end of 2022, the South China Morning Post reported. Unlike other platforms including Alphabet's YouTube and Meta Platform's Instagram, TikTok is a private company that does not publicly disclose its financials in the US.In mid-2022, the company's head of global business solutions, Blake Chandlee, in an interview with CNBC, projected strength around the state of its ads business, saying TikTok had neither experienced an ad market slowdown nor some of the headwinds affecting other tech companies. But in September, TikTok reduced its global revenue targets for 2022 by 20%, the Financial Times reported.It's unclear whether TikTok's layoffs will impact its broader recruiting and talent acquisition strategy. The Information reported in November that TikTok has plans to nearly double its staff at its Mountain View office. The company currently has thousands of global job openings listed on its careers portal. The layoffs come during a brutal week for tech workers. Amazon began the process of letting go of 18,000 staffers this week. Google parent Alphabet prepared to let go of around 12,000 workers. Microsoft cut 10,000 positions, and employees at Twitter also braced for a possible additional round of layoffs.Other creator-focused companies have also opted to make cuts recently in the face of a possible economic downturn, with around two dozen companies including Snapchat-maker Snap, creator-merch company Spring, and creator-monetization company Jellysmack, all laying off employees.TikTok did not respond to Insider's multiple requests for comment."

The changes follow the announcement that Derek Wise, the unit's chief product officer, will leave this month. Wise's departure follows another high-profile exec exit after Don Johnson abruptly resigned this month. Oracle Advertising laid off another round of employees this month and the unit's chief product officer, Derek Wise, is leaving, according to internal emails viewed by Insider. Wise plans to leave Oracle this month and his product organization has already been moved under Stevan Vlaovic, the unit's senior vice president of product and engineering, according to one of the emails. Wise's departure follows another recent, high-profile exit of cloud and health leader Don Johnson, who Insider reported resigned abruptly this month.Previously called Oracle Data Cloud, Oracle renamed its cloud-based advertising and customer relationship management software to Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience. Oracle Advertising now falls under Edward Screven, Oracle's executive vice president and chief corporate architect who reports to founder and CTO Larry Ellison. Customer Experience is under Rob Tarkoff, executive vice president and general manager, who reports to Steven Miranda. The unit also laid off an undisclosed number of employees and reorganized apparently to replace Wise, according to another email from Vlaovic \u2014 who reports to Oracle Advertising boss Screven.\"Over the past few days we have had to make some very tough choices about the future of Oracle Advertising,\" Vlaovic wrote in a Jan. 17 email. \"Our strategy in Oracle Advertising moving forward is to be more focused and be able to self-fund our growth.\"Some of these business units have seen months of turmoil. Oracle's marketing and customer experience divisions were hard hit when Oracle conducted mass layoffs in August, as Insider previously reported. And Oracle's advertising unit also laid off about 60 employees in July,&nbsp;Insider reported. Chris Bell, the former vice president of identity product management who joined Oracle in April 2021, will be the advertising unit's new head of product, with four direct reports running areas like data strategy and compliance, and a data collaboration platform.&nbsp;\"I want to be crystal clear,\" Vlaovic wrote in the email announcing Wise's departure in which he referenced chief revenue officer Mollie Spilman. \"Our strategy has and will not change. Derek, Mollie and myself are hyper aligned with how we want to move forward and our increased focus will position us as THE key player in the advertising ecosystem.\" Related stories Oracle declined comment and Wise did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Do you work at Oracle or have insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Vial let go of its entire site network division, 40 to 50 people, last October, Insider has learned. These cuts followed an earlier round of layoffs during the summer. Just a month after the October cuts, the healthtech startup announced a $67 million funding round. Ahead of the deluge of tech layoffs that have plagued the beginning of 2023, one healthtech startup quietly slashed dozens of jobs late last year, Insider has learned. In October, Vial, which helps biotech companies run faster and more efficient trials, laid off an entire division. The cuts affected between 40 to 50 people, according to two former employees who spoke with Insider, as well as multiple LinkedIn posts authored by former staffers at the time of the layoffs. Insider granted anonymity to the former employees so they could speak about personnel matters. As of December 2022, Vial had 125 employees, according to Pitchbook.&nbsp;The Fall job cuts were preceded by another round of layoffs in Summer 2022 that affected multiple employees working on regulatory issues, said one former employee. The former employees added that the multiple rounds of layoffs came as a shock to many employees \u2014 especially because mere weeks after the October cuts, Vial announced a whopping $67 million Series B round, led by General Catalyst.To date, the buzzy startup \u2014&nbsp;which was founded in 2020 by Andrew Brackin and Simon Burns \u2014 has raised over $100 million from prominent VC firms including Byers Capital and BoxGroup.Representatives for Vial did not respond to multiple requests for comment. General Catalyst also did not respond to request for comment.&nbsp; The cuts arose from a move to revamp Vial's business model, the former employees said. Initially, the startup had acquired the clinical trial divisions of clinics, managing the trial process and employing and providing benefits to clinic researchers, but in 2022, Vial's leadership decided to focus instead on its software offerings instead, the former staffer explained.When this department was slashed, Vial gave the original clinics the option to buy back the clinical trial divisions, which many took, leaving clinical researchers and employees in limbo in the meantime, the former employees said.Vial's troubles mirror those seen in many other hot healthcare and tech companies, like Truepill, a healthtech startup that saw four deep rounds of layoffs in 2022 alone. As the tough market environment continues into the new year, health tech companies will likely be forced to continue making difficult decisions on cost-cutting.

The layoffs affected members of the Whoop Unite team, which sells into organizations. In June of 2022, Whoop rolled out an intitiative to go after enterprises as customers. Whoop, a fitness-wearables startup, has laid off members of its enterprise team, totaling 4% of its corporate workforce, only seven months after it launched an effort to sell into organizations. The layoffs are part of a strategic decision to \"sharpen its focus,\" said a Whoop spokesperson.&nbsp;The workforce cuts come amid a broader wave in the tech industry with giants like Amazon, Salesforce, and Coinbase handing out pink slips to thousands of workers. And many startups have not been immune to scaling back, either.&nbsp; Founded in 2011, Whoop makes a wearable device that measures heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen levels, and skin temperature, and has earned fans like LeBron James and Justin Bieber, to early adopters in the high-tech world.It's raised more than $400 million in funding from investors like IVP, NextView Ventures, and Accomplice, and in August of 2021, at the height of a tech bubble, it netted a $3.6 billion valuation in a funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2.Early on, the company sold mostly to professional athletes and college sports teams, and as it added new features for measuring sleep and respiratory rate, it caught on with regular people, especially during a pandemic&nbsp;that caused people to pay closer attention to their health. Whoop provides the device to consumers for free and charges about $30 a month for an app subscription. Whoop had looked to expand revenue streams over time. In June 2022, it took the wraps off a new division, Whoop Unite, aimed at selling into organizations from universities to healthcare systems to technology giants. It hired Mark McLaughlin, a sofware-industry veteran, as chief business officer, and set a pace to double its enterprise headcount by the end of the year.\"We have always aspired to help organizations empower people with coaching and data to achieve their best performance,\" said Will Ahmed, founder and CEO of Whoop, in a statement announcing Whoop Unit. \"Our new dedicated enterprise solution realizes that vision and represents a new chapter in our company's growth.\"Now, a rash of layoffs raise questions about the success of the initiative. A woman holds a pair of Whoop wearable devices in her hands. Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images The cuts mark the second round of layoffs for Boston-based Whoop in less than a year. It laid off 15% of its corporate staff, or 150 people, in July, according to a report in The Boston Globe. A Whoop spokesperson told the newspaper it had about 550 employees left at that time.&nbsp;Melia Russell is a correspondent for Insider, and writes features about startups and venture capital.

Autograph, the buzzy NFT platform cofounded by NFL star Tom Brady, has laid off dozens of staffers after separately severing ties with former board member Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of FTX, Insider has learned.&nbsp; The layoffs are mostly centered in the marketing, HR, and creative departments, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Autograph employs 124 people, according to Linkedin data.&nbsp;\"Like other technology companies, we aren't immune to the challenges of the market and had to conduct a small workforce reduction,\" the company wrote in a statement, confirming the layoffs. \"We look forward to continuing to build new Web3 fan experiences and products for years to come.\" Brady launched Autograph last year at the height of the NFT sports boom, along with entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt and his son Dillon Rosenblatt, who is the company's CEO.A modern, blockchain-enabled take on trading cards that have been around for more than a century, Autograph enables users to buy non-fungible tokens featuring sports stars such as Tiger Woods, Naomi Osaka, Derek Jeter, and Wayne Gretzky.&nbsp;Autograph, which is based in Los Angeles, closed a $170 million Series B funding round earlier this year led by Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins with participation from former top Andreessen crypto partner Katie Haun, who earlier this year raised a $1.5 billion fund. Haun, Arianna Simpson, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and Ilya Fushman, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, joined a star studded board of directors that already included Brady. Other board members include Eddy Cue, senior vice president at Apple, and Abel Makkonen Tesfaye,&nbsp;the recording artist known as the Weeknd.Bankman-Fried joined the board of directors last year several months after Brady and his then wife, Gisele Bundchen, invested in FTX.&nbsp;\"Autograph is at the forefront of the digital collectable space, and I look forward to helping them expand their capabilities,\" Bankman-Fried said at the time. \"As a pioneer in the space, Autograph has limitless potential as they bring icons and crypto together.\" It is not clear when Bankman-Fried left the board but his name is no longer listed on Autograph's website.&nbsp;By almost every measure, the NFT market has been hit hard since the beginning of the year amidst the broader pullback in stocks and crypto currency. &nbsp;Venture capital funding into Web3 startups in the third quarter of 2022 dropped by nearly half from the previous quarter, to $3.3 billion from $6 billion, according to Crunchbase. Many crypto companies, including Coinbase, Gemini, and OpenSea, have collectively shed more than 1,000 jobs through layoffs.&nbsp;"

The Austrian startup has already cut roles in Italy, Germany, and Vienna, Insider understands. GoStudent has raised $686 million to date and is also backed by Coatue and Prosus. GoStudent, a $3 billion edtech startup backed by some of the world's biggest tech investors, has started laying off staff for the second time in three months, Insider understands. The Vienna-based company, which counts Japan's SoftBank and US hedge fund Coatue among its backers, has already cut roles in Italy, Germany, and Austria with further reductions expected elsewhere, three sources familiar with the matter said.It is unclear how many roles will be affected but two sources based in the DACH region said over 100 people could be laid off as part of the cuts. A global all-hands meeting has been scheduled for 4pm CET on Thursday where full details of the job cuts are expected to be revealed. Screenshots of an all-hands Slack channel obtained by Insider show the number of employees in the channel dropped from 1,690 on Tuesday, to 1,430 on Wednesday. Employees who were laid off immediately had their accounts deactivated, one of the sources said.GoStudent did not respond to Insider's request for comment.GoStudent, which employs around 1,600 people according to its own estimates, is an online learning company offering one-to-one classes in over 30 subjects for students up to college age over video chat. The job cuts come after GoStudent announced in September it had slashed a tenth of its global workforce \u2013 around 200 staffers. They also follow GoStudent's acquisition of Germany center-based tutoring company Studienkreis earlier in the month as it shifts towards a hybrid model of teaching.The startup, which was founded in 2016, doubled its valuation to 3 billion euros ($3.19 billion) in a 300 million euro Series D round in January that was led by Dutch investor Prosus. As it grew rapidly, the company also continued a slew of acquisitions, including UK-based revision platform Seneca and Spanish tutoring marketplace Tus.A rocky macroeconomic environment has seen many growth-stage startups pivot from rapid, expensive expansion fuelled by easy venture capital cash to efficiency and profitability. As they find it tougher to raise cash from more cautious investors that, in practice, has meant cost-cutting and layoffs. Despite a boom in online education during the pandemic, education platforms are feeling the squeeze. San Francisco-based Outschool cut a quarter of staff last week, TechCrunch&nbsp;reported. BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School, also halved its staff, per&nbsp;TechCrunch.&nbsp;According to public layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi, almost 1,000 tech companies have cut more than 150,000 staff.A GoStudent spokesperson told Insider in September that it had \"made some adjustments to its business plan\" to ensure the company \"remains sufficiently funded throughout these unpredictable times.\"&nbsp;"

Digital ad firm Viant said it plans to lay off 13% of its workforce, or about 46 employees, becoming the latest in a line of adtech companies trimming headcount in the face of an advertising downturn. The company said in a financial filing late last week that the move is meant to reduce costs and \"sharpen the company's focus on key growth priorities in light of the current adverse macroeconomic environment.\" The company also noted it would incur $1.2 million in charges in connection with the reduction.&nbsp;A Viant spokesperson said in a statement the company had undertaken cost reduction actions affecting employees in \"several areas of the company,\" without specifying which departments.

        "Extracted Article": "Spora Health's founder and CEO, Dan Miller, told Insider his firm was seeing thousands of patients. Insider has since found Spora is struggling after closing shop and laying off its workers in 2022. Miller was pushed out of his last company after he was accused of misusing funds, documents show. The way Dan Miller told it, his startup Spora Health was crushing it, providing high-quality care to \"thousands\" of people online. But now he's backtracking, after Insider's reporting found Spora to be struggling after laying off its workers. Miller founded the Bay Area startup in 2019 to take on a serious problem: In the US, people of color tend to have worse healthcare experiences and outcomes than white people. He said he wanted to erase these disparities by training healthcare providers in bias and health equity.Spora attracted a ton of media attention early on. Articles in Fast Company, TechCrunch, and other outlets highlighted Miller's mission. Insider first wrote about Spora in 2021 when it landed $3 million in a seed-plus round, bringing its total funding to $4.1 million. At the time, the company was tiny, serving about 100 patients in four states, Miller said back then. Two years later, Insider interviewed Miller to determine whether to feature him on an annual list of top young healthcare leaders. In an interview in July, Miller said the company had \"expanded significantly,\" offering online healthcare in more than 22 states. He said Spora planned to be available nationwide this year.Miller said Spora was serving \"thousands\" of patients \"right now\" and working with \"a lot of large enterprises,\" including Fortune 10 companies, to provide Spora's services to their workers or other groups of people. He declined to disclose those companies.\"I wish I could say some names, but I can't right now, but things have been going really, really well,\" he said in July. The impression Miller gave of Spora was one of a young company firing on all cylinders. Based on the interview, Spora's mission, and previous conversations with Miller, Insider included him on the list and published an interview with him.After the interview came out, a former employee contacted Insider to share a more troubling view of Spora, prompting Insider to look into the company more deeply.Interviews with seven former employees and a source close to the company, as well as an internal memo, suggest that Spora shut down, at least temporarily, near the end of 2022 and laid off its small team of workers after failing to pay them for a month. Some former workers are still trying to recover their pay from Spora. Insider also found that Spora's size might be more limited than Miller said. Some of the clinicians listed on Spora's website no longer work for the company or aren't seeing patients. Public documents show Spora's business registrations have gone inactive or fallen out of compliance in numerous states.Confronted with these findings, Miller confirmed in a phone call on October 23 that Spora had laid off all of its workers after it was unable to raise a Series A funding round last year. He said he had believed the company would need to shut down and that he was able to keep Spora alive by renegotiating contracts with employers and health plans and signing new ones.He said that more than 2,000 people had registered online to get care from Spora but that not all of them had attended appointments with a clinician. He declined to say how many people had received care from Spora this year but said \"it's been slow.\" The company, which now has fewer than five employees, is working to raise money so it can hire more people and grow, he said. \"Going into 2023, we were able to have another chance and keep our doors open and try to keep serving all of our patients and all of our customers and stakeholders,\" Miller said. \"But obviously as a solo founder and running the show on my own for a little bit of time, things are slow.\"Insider also reviewed internal communications and a complaint filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that show Miller was pushed out of his previous venture before Spora, a company that provided mental-health care online, after he was accused of misappropriating tens of thousands of dollars of company funds. Miller declined to comment on this company.Insider has removed Miller from its list of top young healthcare leaders. Spora shut down in 2022 and laid off its employees, email says The telehealth startup Spora Health's app. Spora Health In early 2022, Spora seemed to be gaining some traction. It had turned its focus from selling its services directly to consumers to also working with employers, Miller said in the July interview. The startup had secured at least one big contract, with Apple, according to three former Spora employees and another source close to Spora. A page on Spora's site says Apple partnered with Aetna and UnitedHealthcare to offer Spora to Apple employees. Related stories Apple and Aetna didn't return requests for comment. UnitedHealthcare declined to comment.Still, five former employees said Spora was treating few patients, and nowhere near thousands, as of the latter half of 2022. By the middle of 2022, things started to break down at Spora. Miller spent six weeks away from the company in June and July of that year while taking part in a Stanford Graduate School of Business executive education program, according to five former Spora employees and a source close to the company. Miller left Spora in the hands of his chief of staff, who had been with the company for a few months, four of those former employees said.His absence confused some employees, who were under the impression he was working to raise a Series A round. Two former employees said progress on various projects stalled while Miller was away because he wasn't available to sign off.In November, paychecks stopped coming, according to four former employees. Then, on the Monday after Thanksgiving, Miller held a company meeting in which he told employees Spora was shutting down, two former employees said. Three former employees recalled that Miller said the company didn't have enough money to continue operations.Miller followed up with an email to employees on November 30 that said Spora had ceased operating and \"everyone's employment is terminated\" as of November 28. Insider reviewed a copy of the email, which also said any retroactive payments would be made directly to employees' bank accounts. He said in the email that Spora was in talks to get acquired.Three former employees told Insider recently that they still hadn't been paid fully and were working to recover what they say they are owed. Miller told Insider he had expected to be able to pay employees and wind things down at Spora with bridge financing after the Series A round fell through. But he said an investor gave Spora less than it initially said it would and Spora didn't have enough money to pay all workers.Spora's investors, including Refactor Capital, Human Ventures, and MaC Venture Capital, didn't respond to requests for comment on this story. The venture firm M13 declined to comment.Miller said he paid some workers with his own money in November and December and then paid other former employees what he thought was the full amount Spora owed them in late February and early March of this year. Spora has been communicating with the former employees to determine how much it still owes them, and Miller said he was working to resolve the matter. Miller was pushed out of his previous company after he was accused of misusing company fundsMiller called Spora the third company he's founded. It's not the first to run into difficulties.Before Spora, Miller started the mental-health care company Level Therapy, an app launched in 2016 that people could use to have video chats with therapists, and FreshSessions, a marketplace for musicians to book recording studios, according to news articles and his LinkedIn profile.Level raised hundreds of thousands of dollars through the incubator 500 Startups (now 500 Global), a SeedInvest crowdfunding campaign, and from individual investors, company documents show. In September 2017, Level executives accused Miller of using company funds for personal reasons and demanded that he resign, according to internal documents and emails. Miller's cofounder also filed a police report that month related to his use of funds, according to an internal email. A police department document shows the report was filed but not its contents.An investor filed a complaint with the SEC in October 2017 alleging Miller misappropriated funds and misrepresented information to prospective investors about the company's finances and progress. Insider viewed a copy of the complaint.&nbsp;The investor said the SEC never responded to the complaint. An SEC spokesperson said the agency doesn't comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.At least $31,000 of expenses that Miller charged to Level in 2017 were for personal reasons and unrelated to business, according to an auditor's analysis provided to Level executives in September 2017 and viewed by Insider. A summary of the audit also says the full amount of an outside investment did not appear to have been deposited in Level's bank account. In a September 2017 email seen by Insider, Miller denied allegations of fraud. He eventually agreed to pay roughly $32,000 to Level, according to a copy of a promissory note dated December 13, 2017. He paid the sum more than three years later, in February 2021, according to a message viewed by Insider.By then, Miller had already moved on. In November 2020, news outlets reported that Spora had raised about $1 million in seed funding.In the October 23&nbsp;interview, Miller declined to comment on his time at Level. Spora most likely isn't operating at the scale Miller claimedThis year, Miller has continued to do interviews about Spora and celebrate company milestones, without any mention of the company ceasing operations or laying off staff. Related stories Miller wrote about company achievements on LinkedIn, including posts about a collaboration with a design studio and achieving accreditation for Spora's cultural-competency training program. In April, Spora issued a press release sharing results from its maternal-health program.Currently, Spora's reach appears to be more limited than Miller said in July. Spora's medical group has filed paperwork to do business in at least 18 states, but the registrations aren't active or current, or have been revoked, in 10 of them, according to Insider's review of public documents.In the October 23 interview, Miller said that Spora's counsel didn't file this paperwork on time because of a clerical error but that the paperwork had since been sent off to bring Spora's registrations back into good standing. He maintained that Spora had coverage in 22 states. Still, Spora's website as of October 27 allows people in only nine states to sign up for a membership.Spora's website also provided inaccurate information about the company's medical staff by including clinicians who no longer work for the company. As of mid-September, 11 clinicians \u2014 mostly nurses and physician assistants \u2014 were listed as available for appointments, according to Insider's review. Four of them told Insider they either no longer worked with Spora or hadn't seen Spora patients in a year. Two of the clinicians declined to speak with Insider, and Insider could not reach the rest.Two doctors listed on Spora's website as \"featured Spora providers\" also told Insider that they no longer worked for the startup. The company's founding physician, whose name is signed to an email sent to new members, also no longer works for Spora, two former employees said.Miller said Spora was working to ensure its systems don't show providers who don't have availability or who are no longer with the company. \"Sometimes things, it takes time to get to them with the team that we have right now, the limited team and the limited resources and the folks that we've brought back,\" Miller said. \"But we're working to make sure that we can continue to grow and scale, and also that we continue to provide high-quality care for everyone, but also making sure that the product reflects that.\"One of the former clinicians still listed as taking appointments told Insider that despite starting with the company in mid-2022, she never saw any patients before she was told the company was shutting down at the end of last year.Another former clinician said she only ever treated a handful of Spora patients. \"It wasn't a very busy place,\" she said.Want to tell us about your experience with Spora?

        "Extracted Article": "This latest round of layoff culls the company down to 30 people.The all-cash offers company previously&nbsp;laid off 40% of its employees, in July.This updates Insider's November 19 story about impending staff cuts.Proptech Ribbon laid off about 170 people, or 85% of its remaining staff, on Monday, reducing the startup that helps people make all-cash offers on homes to a shell of its former self, according to a company spokesperson. Company executives sent emails announcing the layoffs to each affected employee this morning.\"After today, Ribbon will be a company of less than 30 people,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. Ribbon employees had been waiting for an update about the cuts since last week, when CEO Shaival Shah told staff that a second and potentially large round of layoffs was imminent. In a November 15 email to employees reviewed by Insider, Shah wrote that the layoffs would be \"deeper\" than the company initially expected, and that severance would \"differ\" from initial plans.The company laid off 139 employees \u2013 some 40% of its workforce \u2014 this summer, which left the company with around 200 employees on its payroll.Ribbon, founded in 2017 by Shah and chief technology officer Wei Gan, offers software for real estate agents and temporary financing for homebuyers looking to better compete with all-cash offers. Investors like Goldman Sachs and Greylock have provided $900 million in funding since its inception. \"This is a re-balance and the reduction in force is the first and most painful part of that,\" the spokesperson said in the statement.Inman recently reported Ribbon suspended cash offer service.Staff cuts represent just the latest batch of layoffs in the proptech and mortgage sectors, which have been battered in 2022 by soaring interest rates and falling demand. Sales of existing homes in the US declined for the ninth consecutive month in October, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. Among recent layoffs, online brokerage Redfin shut down its iBuying business earlier this month and laid off 862 employees, or 13% of its workforce, after cutting 6% of its workers in June. Meantime, iBuyer Opendoor let 18% of its workforce \u2014 some 550 employees \u2014 go earlier in the month. Like Ribbon, those companies blamed the cooling housing market and widespread economic uncertainty.Tech company layoffs have ballooned far beyond the niche covered by Ribbon, Opendoor and Redfin, too. Behemoths like Twitter, Amazon and Meta this month axed thousands of jobs, in aggregate, with more likely to come.Shah indicated in last week's email that Ribbon's \"situation has changed considerably\" after talks with Ribbon's funders. He encouraged employees to turn their attention to their \"self care.\" \"During the time of uncertainty, we ask team members who are not customer or finance-facing to shift their focus from their work to self-care, spending time with family and doing things that bring you comfort. We ask that you stay 'on call' in case your support is needed to come to a resolution as quickly as possible,\" he said in the email.Read the rest of Shah's November 15 email here:Team, First and foremost, thank you for your patience through this challenging time for Ribbon. We know this has been an uneasy week and we apologize for sharing this information so late in the day.The company's situation has changed considerably since our last email announcing the upcoming Reduction in Force (RIF). This is primarily due to ongoing discussions with our funding partners.I know we have mentioned this already, but RIF will have to be much deeper based upon the events of the last few months, and the uncertainty of what lies ahead. Business circumstances continue to evolve, and unfortunately severance packages will differ from what we originally believed to be achievable. We sincerely regret having to send you this note and would not be making this change unless it was absolutely necessary. We will have a specific answer and decision to share with everyone on Monday. We know everyone is anxious and we are working with the various counterparts daily. If we were able to finalize sooner, we will certainly share with you earlier.During the time of uncertainty, we ask team members who are not customer or finance-facing to shift their focus from their work to self-care, spending time with family and doing things that bring you comfort. We ask that you stay \"on call\" in case your support is needed to come to a resolution as quickly as possible.This is never where we planned to be or wanted to be. We want to thank you for helping to build something important that has impacted so many people's lives.

        "Extracted Article": "Redfin announced it would cut 862 people, or 13% of its staff, on Wednesday. It's winding down its home-flipping business, RedfinNow, also known as an iBuyer. The layoffs follow job cuts in June and signal the company sees a housing contraction into 2023. The real-estate company Redfin announced on Wednesday that it would lay off 862 staffers, or 13% of its workforce as it sees the housing contraction lingering into 2023. Of the cuts, 264 of those are related to the company's home-flipping business, RedfinNow, which it will shut down, the company said in a financial filing.An additional 218 staffers will have their roles eliminated, though they're being offered a new role within the company, Redfin said. The announcement comes after Redfin's stock took a nosedive to a record low, after Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein downgraded its stock to underperform and called the business \"fundamentally flawed.\"The company was already feeling the pain of the housing slowdown in June when it saw homebuying demand plunge 17% year-over-year, and cut more than 470 employees in response. Its quarterly loss nearly tripled in the the second quarter to $78.1 million from the same period a year earlier, and was expected to climb again. It reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.In a memo to employees, CEO Glenn Kelman said Redfin's business outlook darkened from just a few months earlier. \"We plan to keep increasing our share of the market, but that market in 2023 is likely to be 30% smaller than it was in 2021,\" Kelman wrote. \"The June layoff was a response to our expectation that we'd sell fewer houses in 2022; this layoff assumes the downturn will last at least through 2023.\"Redfin was one of a handful of companies known as instant buyers, or iBuyers \u2014 deep-pocketed tech companies that use algorithms to make quick cash offers to home sellers. The business model, popularized by companies like Zillow and Opendoor, has suffered setbacks recently as companies struggle to offload homes at a profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago, Zillow announced it would be shutting down its own iBuying division and laying off roughly 2,000 people, about a quarter of its workforce. At the time, Zillow estimated that it would be forced to write down as much as $569 million on the thousands of homes on its books.&nbsp; Zillow's home-flipping unit, known as Zillow Offers, had been aggressively bidding on homes in an effort to gain market share and catch up to rival Opendoor, an Insider investigation found. That plan backfired when the company was forced to sell thousands of homes at a loss."

CloudKitchens joins other startups that are eliminating staff as private market valuations plunge. These young businesses are under more pressure to control costs. CloudKitchens,&nbsp;the richly valued startup founded by former Uber chief Travis Kalanick, is cutting jobs as a pandemic-era boom in online food ordering subsidesand a recession looms.&nbsp; The ghost kitchen operator has shed&nbsp;corporate recruiting employees, a move made to get closer to profitability, according to a person close to the matter.On November 1, employees on the recruiting team were asked to attend an impromptu Zoom meeting, described as a \"global update.\" Staff were told to give the meeting priority over other meetings, this person said.&nbsp; David Tunna, head of recruiting, read from a script, according to the person, who witnessed the video call. Tunna said Kalanick's goal is for CloudKitchens&nbsp;to be profitable next year, and with that, the startup has to make some changes, according to the witness.\"We're going to be downsizing. If you're a part of these layoffs, you will meet with your manager and an HR VP sometime today,\" the source recalled Tunna saying.After the speech, which lasted about five minutes, Tunna exited the call. About 10 minutes later, everyone who was going to be laid off that day had another Zoom meeting put on their calendar with their manager and a human resources representative.&nbsp; The source estimated the layoffs impacted about 30 people in the recruiting division. Another person, a current employee of CloudKitchens, confirmed that job cuts have happened. Both people asked not to be identified discussing private matters.&nbsp;CloudKitchens joins many other startups that are eliminating employees as plunging private market valuations put pressure on young businesses to cut costs.

        "Extracted Article": "Insider has learned that InfoSum laid off around 20 staffers earlier this month. Sources said the company had struggled to gain traction in the US and missed revenue targets. InfoSum said the layoffs were due to uncertainty in the macro economy. Data-management company InfoSum had a recent round of layoffs, the company confirmed. The layoffs, which happened this month, come as it faces a gloomy economic outlook and as the company has struggled to hit its revenue targets, according to people familiar with the matter. Founded in the UK in 2016, InfoSum is a software-as-a-service platform that offers companies tools to store and manage their data. It also licences a so-called data bunker that helps advertisers, publishers, and adtech companies co-mingle their data to find customers they have in common, or other insights that can be used for marketing. The data itself is aggregated, cleaned of any identifiable information, and can't be removed from the bunker.The layoffs earlier this month were across areas including engineering and sales, the people familiar with the matter told Insider. Prior to that, the company had clamped down on costs, such as marketing, those people said. Another person familiar with the matter estimated the layoffs hit 12% of Infosum's staff, or about 20 employees.The company's founder, Nicholas Halstead, also left the company this week, according to an announcement on his LinkedIn profile. His post said that he had \"been transitioning out of the company for a while\" and that he planned to spend more time pursuing his motorsport career.\"Due to uncertainty in the macro economy, we recently made the difficult decision to reduce headcount,\" CEO Brian Lesser said in a statement. \"Out of respect for our impacted employees we did not announce these decisions publicly.\" People familiar with the company said InfoSum had struggled to gain traction in the US with a product that was built in the UK, a much smaller market. Companies in Europe \u2014 where data-privacy rules like the General Data Protection Regulation, came into force years ago \u2014 tend to prioritize privacy more than those in the US, they said.&nbsp;And while InfoSum has boasted impressive case studies from the likes of broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 and the retailer Boots in the UK, it hasn't managed to secure equivalent anchor clients in the US, those people said.&nbsp;The company didn't hit its revenue goal last year and these people said it was unlikely it'd hit its 2022 target either. Lesser said in a statement that InfoSum had doubled the size of its business in the last 18 months and that it planned to double again in the next 12 months. Lesser said the company has more than 100 partners and customers across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia \"including significant anchors.\"Lesser told The Wall Street Journal in August 2021 that the company expected to generate more than $15 million in revenue that year.When Lesser, a former executive of AT&amp;T's ad unit Xandr and ad agency holding company WPP,&nbsp; joined the company's board of directors in 2020, industry observers believed it was to help InfoSum ramp up its business in the US. Lesser became CEO later that year and helped secure its 2021 $65 million Series B financing. At the time, he said the funding \u2014 which brought its total investment to around $90 million \u2014 would be used to expand internationally and hire across sales, customer relations, operations, and engineering.&nbsp; InfoSum's products compete with similar \"data clean room\" technology from companies like Habu, Snowflake, LiveRamp, and Optable, but the space is still nascent and many marketers have yet to trial the tech. Earlier this month, companies in the space \u2014 including InfoSum \u2014 launched \"The Clean Room Primer Group,\" to educate marketers on the technology and to work together on industry standards.But convincing marketers to take on extra costs in the face of a recession, when many companies are already trimming their marketing budgets, will be challenging, industry observers told Insider.&nbsp;\"I think it's just hard to get rapid adoption of this new tech, which, candidly, kind of feels like a tax right now because the business model is still evolving,\" said one industry executive. \"Wait, I used to buy ads with all this free data from cookies and [mobile advertising IDs] and now I have to pay just to make the same ad buy I was making a year ago?\""

London-based carbon accounting startup Emitwise has become the latest to cut jobs. Investors have remained bullish on the sector, with startups raising $13.7 billion up to June. Carbon accounting startup Emitwise has become the latest climate tech startup to lay off staff as the industry jostles with the economic downturn, Insider understands. The London-based startup, which has raised $19.2 million to date, has developed a carbon management platform for manufacturers in the automotive, construction, FMCG, and packaging industries. The company employed 70 people as of October 3.Emitwise declined Insider's request for an interview but confirmed it was \"right-sizing\" the business due to the challenging macro environment. The company did not reveal how many employees had been laid off. Zoomo and Mosa Meat investor ArcTern Ventures is among the company's backers alongside London investor Outsized Ventures.Emitwise joins Berlin-based vertical farming company Infarm in scaling down its workforce. The Atomico and Balderton-backed unicorn laid off 50 employees, or 5% of its headcount in September, Sifted reported.Meanwhile, Bill Gates-backed climate startup Turntide, which is based in California but has a presence in the UK, laid off almost 20% of staff in July \u2013 a month after raising $80 million and hitting a $1 billion valuation. The weakened economic outlook has wreaked havoc on the wider tech industry with public companies like Snap forced into bruising layoffs and startups such as Klarna cornered into accepting a markedly reduced valuation.However, climate tech has been somewhat insulated from the market \u2013 but \"not 100%,\" according to Helen Lin, partner at At One Ventures.\"Like in any other sector, there are bound to be a certain percentage that struggle,\" she said.&nbsp; Climate tech is wide-ranging, encapsulating everything from research and development-heavy batteries to carbon accounting SaaS tools. Each solution has a varying degree of impact, with many firms using carbon abated or removed as a measurement.&nbsp;Global venture capital pumped into climate startups spiked last year, doubling between 2020 and 2021 to over $30 billion, according to PitchBook.Startups in the sector had raised $13.7 billion up to June 3 this year, down on the $17.9 billion raised in the first half of 2020, its data showed. PitchBook also pointed out that 2021 had featured a \"string of outsized venture deals\" for battery makers Northvolt and SVOLT. Helen Lin, partner at At One Ventures. At One Ventures Trying times may push investors to rethink strategy and prioritize startups driving \"real value,\" Lin said. Related stories \"When the amount of available capital becomes limited in a downturn, it means that capital will generally be prioritized for only the top solutions that feel like they will drive the highest value to the cause,\" she said.In fact, there has been \"phenomenal growth\" across some subsectors, according to Kiko Ventures partner Arne Morteani. \"Crisis creates opportunity and the cost of living crisis highlights just how pressing the development of climate tech and addressing issues around energy supply is,\" he said.The energy crisis has been a boon for home energy startups working on rooftop solar, heat pumps, and smart thermostats. Sharing economy models, such as peer-to-peer sharing and rental models, also help to alleviate problems tied to the cost of living crisis, he said.&nbsp;This is in stark contrast to the decline in climate investing Morteani expected when the energy crisis hit. \"We feared that the world would regress to the times when climate change was seen as a luxury problem,\" he said. \"But quite the opposite happened, which makes us very optimistic.\" At One Ventures' Lin added that in moments of economic difficulty \"sometimes the&nbsp;most interesting innovations are born.\"\"It's like that cliche that necessity is the mother of invention,\" she said."

HelloFresh and rivals like Blue Apron have struggled with profitability as the public opens back up. The meal-kit maker HelloFresh is laying off over 600 employees and closing a facility in the Bay Area, according to California state records. The company notified 611 workers at its Richmond, California, warehouse on October 10 that it plans to eliminate their roles as of December 11. HelloFresh notified the State of California under the requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.The layoffs are associated with the permanent closure of the facility, according to the notice. The warehouse itself, located at 2041 Factory Street in Richmond, is currently listed for lease, according to PropertyShark.\"The lease for HelloFresh's production facility in Richmond is expiring at the beginning of 2023 and after an extensive analysis of our production network, HelloFresh has decided not to extend the lease,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. The company is focusing on \"newer, more efficient sites,\" and \"profitable growth through strategic investments in infrastructure, technology, and high-efficiency operations.\"\"The decision not to extend the lease is not a reflection of the local teams' performance, and we are grateful for their contributions,\" the spokesperson said about the layoffs. The Richmond facility is one of two warehouses in the US where HelloFresh employees attempted to organize a union last year. The other warehouse that saw a union drive is in Aurora, Colorado.&nbsp;Workers at both facilities voted against creating a union, the industry publication Food Dive reported in December.Like many grocery-delivery players, HelloFresh saw sales rise in the early months of the pandemic. The company ships ingredients and recipes to customers, allowing them to prepare their own meals and hone their cooking skills. HelloFresh has continued to grow sales in 2022 even as rivals such as Imperfect Foods saw their sales fade as pandemic restrictions lifted.But HelloFresh's EBITDA fell nearly 23% in the six months through June 30, according to a recent earnings report. Shares of the Berlin-based company are down roughly 68% so far in 2022, falling farther than the broader market.A rival meal-kit company, Blue Apron, has also seen its shares take a similar dive, falling 67% year-to-date. Last year, HelloFresh started allowing customers to add other grocery items to their regular meal-kit deliveries. Uwe Voss, the US CEO of HelloFresh, told Insider at the time that the company was trying to capture a greater portion of consumers' overall grocery budgets \u2014 a tactic that often helps grocers improve their profitability."

Over a dozen digital-health startups have conducted layoffs this year as the market tightens. The digital-health startup Wheel cut 17% of its staff on August 18, Insider has learned. In an email sent to Wheel staff on August 18 and shared with Insider, CEO Michelle Davey said the company decided to conduct layoffs in service of its long-term strategy.The Austin, Texas-based startup provides virtual-care infrastructure and a national clinician network to help companies ramp up telehealth services faster and at reduced costs. It's led the pack of startups acting as a backbone for health systems, insurers, and other healthcare companies venturing into virtual care. Davey said the company had planned to move this year from building a marketplace of solutions, like tools for patient messaging, scheduling, and payments,&nbsp;to building its own platform to connect patients with virtual care.By cutting staff, Wheel plans to \"prioritize quality over quantity of our efforts,\" Davey wrote \u2014 \"For example, we'll invest more heavily in the platform experience for Wheel clinicians so they can more easily focus on providing great patient care.\"A Wheel spokesperson said the company let go of 35 employees, or 17% of its workforce.

Read the full email Davey sent to Wheel staff announcing the layoffs.Hi team \u2014 Related stories Today will be a tough day for Wheel. We've made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team and part ways with 35 Wheelies. We wanted to hold true to our commitment to transparency and communicate this as early as possible so that you know what is happening and what to expect next.Within the next 20 minutes, those of you who are leaving Wheel will receive a calendar invite to meet with a senior leader in your department. You'll have the opportunity to learn more about the decision and ask questions in a private conversation. For those who are staying, we'll be gathering as a team at 3 pm CT to discuss this news and our go-forward strategy. You'll receive a calendar invite in the next hour. In the meantime, I wanted to provide more context regarding why we made this decision, how we're taking care of those who are leaving, and how we'll move forward from here.&nbsp;Why we made this decisionFrom the start, our mission has been to put great care within everyone's reach. Over the last few years, we've collectively built a strong business by pairing technology with the leading clinician network for virtual care. We've provided care to millions of people while offering clinicians a new way to work in healthcare.&nbsp; As you know, this year we planned to move from Horizon 1 (building our marketplace) to Horizon 2 (building our enterprise platform). Horizon 2 is the logical next step for our business to unlock more virtual-first care markets and opportunities. By scaling the underlying infrastructure for the industry, we'll accelerate everyone's ability to get quality care on-demand \u2014 at any time, from anywhere, and on their own terms.&nbsp;This decision to part ways with some of our teammates wasn't easy and I don't take it lightly. But this was the right decision to make for our long-term success and to accelerate our move into Horizon 2. Just as importantly, it allows us to prioritize quality over quantity of our efforts. For example, we'll invest more heavily in the platform experience for Wheel clinicians&nbsp;so they can more easily focus on providing great patient care.Additionally, as we've discussed as a team, we've been proactively planning for an uncertain economy so that we're prepared to execute with focus and adjust as needed. That includes accelerating our fundraising timeline to close our Series C last December. Together, these actions give us the stability to achieve our strategic goals and solidify our position as the clear market leader as we navigate market conditions and industry dynamics. How are we supporting those who are leaving us?We value the contributions of the Wheelies leaving us today. Because of their commitment to Wheel and our mission, we've made great strides through Horizon 1 as we built our marketplace. I want to express my gratitude for their contributions, which is why we're prioritizing putting them in the best position possible by offering a comprehensive severance package.How will we move forward? For those who are leaving, I'm incredibly grateful for the role each of you has played in Wheel's journey.&nbsp;For those who are staying, you'll be hearing from your team leads later this morning. In addition to meeting as a company at 3 pm CT, next week we'll discuss our go-forward plans more extensively, including our product strategy, in our All Hands on Tuesday the 23rd. I know this is a lot to process so please take the time you need to take care of yourself and prioritize your wellbeing.&nbsp;And for everyone, I can't say thank you enough for your commitment to our mission of putting great care within everyone's reach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,Michelle&nbsp;"

The layoffs hit various divisions, including engineering, marketing, and talent.\"We made redundancies where we had over-hired, with varying levels of reductions by teams and departments,\" Permutive CEO Joe Root wrote in a blog post that was published after Insider requested comment from the company. \"Some teams were more heavily affected than others \u2014 that was not a reflection of their importance or contribution to the company, but rather a case of having over-hired ahead of revenue.\" Root said the company paused hiring in June amid concerns about the economy's impact on advertising spending and venture capital.\"Big tech companies like Google and Facebook started freezing hiring in response to slowing ad spend, which was a leading indicator that forecasting where advertisers spend would get measurably harder and unpredictable in the coming months,\" Root wrote in the post.It's the latest in a string of layoffs to hit the tech industry. More than 30,000 tech employees lost their jobs in July. In adtech in particular, companies from Oracle to AppLovin have cut staff as marketers have trimmed their spending amid a softening economy.

Its latest round last year was led by SoftBank through its Vision Fund 2, with existing investors EQT Ventures, Octopus Ventures, and Ace &amp; Company also participating. At the time of the raise, Permutive CEO Joe Root said the company wanted to use the fresh funds to double its then-140-person staffand expand into the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions over the next couple of years.SoftBank this week posted a $21.68 billion loss for its Vision Fund in the second quarter of this year, having been hit by the recent stock market slump. SoftBank has said it also may need to \"dramatically\" reduce headcount at its Vision Fund. At least 10 companies backed by SoftBank have had layoffs so far this year."

Slync's board fired Chris Kirchner, the startup's globe-trotting CEO and cofounder. Slync.io, the Goldman Sachs-backed supply-chain tech startup that failed to pay employees in full for almost three months, laid off some staff Friday, said two affected employees and two former employees with contacts inside the company.&nbsp; Slync's board has also terminated Chris Kirchner, the company's CEO and cofounder, and removed him from the board, after suspending him last week. Tim Kehoe, the company's former chief of staff, was named interim president, Insider reported last week and Slync has confirmed.&nbsp;Burt White, Slync's vice president of global sales and marketing, declined to comment on the number of layoffs.&nbsp; Kirchner and Kehoe gave several explanations for the company's missed payroll to the staff and media in the past three months. During that time, Kirchner tried and failed to buy a British football club and played in multiple international golf tournaments.&nbsp;Kehoe told staff in an all-hands meeting last week that the board would be helping the company with its liquidity struggles to get unpaid and underpaid employees all the money owed to them. Kehoe forecast the \"restructuring\" then.&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday morning, Kehoe sent Slync employees an email that said payroll had been made in full. Five current and former employees confirmed to Insider that they had received their overdue wages.&nbsp; \"Those days are behind us,\" Kehoe wrote.&nbsp;Less than an hour later, Slync began laying off employees via individual calls with company leadership. Canadian employees were given two weeks of severance, and US employees were given none, said one affected employee and one former employee with knowledge of the offers.&nbsp;\"For me, it was not really shocking,\" one affected employee told Insider. They said they stayed with the company despite the payroll issues because they believed Kehoe and Kirchner's explanations from May and June, that a locked-up investment froze the company's cash flow.&nbsp; Friday's layoffs affected employees across departments and appeared to affect those who had questioned management about the payroll issues on Slack, the same laid-off employee said.&nbsp;\"All the people who questioned the management were laid off,\" the affected employee said.&nbsp;White confirmed in a statement that the board fired Kirchner, but he declined to answer Insider's questions regarding the departments affected, the severance offered, or how laid-off employees were selected. Since Insider and other media outlets began reporting on Slync's failure to pay employees in June, management has locked several employees out of the company email and Slack without formally terminating them, current and former employees said. At least one of these people was also laid off on Friday, the affected employee told Insider.&nbsp;\"Now that this chapter in Slync's history is closed, we must collectively focus on the future and continue to deliver value to our customers with our world-class software,\" Kehoe wrote to employees in the Friday-morning email announcing Kirchner's termination.&nbsp;Here's the full note Kehoe sent to Slync staff:&nbsp; Team Slync,&nbsp;I know the past two months have been extremely difficult for every one of you and your families. Missing payroll and the lack of truthful communications surrounding those payrolls was completely unacceptable, you deserve better. However, thanks to the tremendous support of our board of directors and current investors, all the payrolls have gone out and those days are behind us. Additionally, the Slync Board of Directors took decisive action this week to terminate Chris as the CEO and as an employee of the company. In conjunction with the board's actions to suspend and ultimately remove the CEO, the board has entrusted me as the interim president to lead us through this time of transition and I'm humbled to have the opportunity.&nbsp;Now that this chapter in Slync's history is closed, we must collectively focus on the future and continue to deliver value to our customers with our world-class software.&nbsp; Very Respectfully,&nbsp;Tim"

        "Extracted Article": "Cannabis-tech firm Weedmaps laid off 10% of employees, per an August 4 memo. The company's stock has suffered this year, falling over 55%. Cannabis is far from recession-proof, as Weedmaps' recent layoffs show.&nbsp; Layoffs have already come for tech. Now, they're coming for cannabis too. Cannabis-tech firm Weedmaps is cutting 10% of its workforce, Insider has learned. The company had 606 full-time workers at the end of 2021. In an email dated August 4 that was obtained by Insider, CEO Chris Beals cited a slowdown in legal cannabis sales in states like Colorado and California, the rising price of gas, and broader economic conditions that point to a coming recession.\"There are certainly lessons I will learn from this, and we will continue to do the best we can to grow and guide the business for employees, clients and investors. In regard to the slowdown of end markets, I was wrong in predicting that this would bottom out at the start of the year and that we would start to see a recovery,\" Beals wrote. A Weedmaps spokesperson confirmed the layoffs to Insider. In a follow-up statement, Beals said that given the macroeconomic challenges, the \"prudent approach was to plan more conservatively for the coming quarters.\"\"Though difficult, we believe this restructure better positions the company to weather end market turbulence and operate profitably in the second half of the year,\" Beals said in the statement.Weedmaps&nbsp;lists recreational and medical cannabis shops on its site, allowing consumers to browse dispensaries and see reviews of marijuana products. It also provides a way for cannabis businesses to engage with customers and market products. The layoffs point to coming troubles in the cannabis industry, which has proven to be far from recession-proof as some commentators have suggested.&nbsp;Like many other publicly traded cannabis companies, Weedmaps stock has suffered this year. Nasdaq-listed shares have dropped over 55% this year, as legal cannabis sales have slowed and broader economic shocks have hit the market.Weedmaps was also the subject of a pair of July complaints that alleged the firm was listing illegal marijuana products and shops on its platform, as Marijuana Business Daily reported. Read the full memo from Weedmaps CEO Chris Beals here:Dear Weedmappers:This is a tough email to write. As many of you have heard by now, we made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team by about 10% today. The impacts were distributed fairly evenly across teams in the company and were focused on areas where we felt we could achieve our same level of growth even with the reduction in staff. As part of this, we have also moved to centralize certain functions across the company and cut costs that weren't directly driving the growth of the marketplace, driving revenue or increasing product adoption.By many measures, our growth for the last few quarters has been strong, and we outpaced the growth of legal cannabis markets by a significant margin. We have also been conducting active, ongoing rationalization of investment areas (e.g Weedmaps Exchange, Weedmaps Retail).&nbsp; Unfortunately, the confluence of several factors have created a set of headwinds that lead me to believe we need to be conservative with our spending in the immediate future. These factors include:\u2022 Several of the cannabis end-markets have actually contracted over the last few quarters, notably California (-12% y/y), Oklahoma (-21% y/y) and Colorado (-17% y/y), each which have experienced meaningful slowdown in legal cannabis sales.\u2022 The rapid increase in gas prices put heavy pressure on delivery operators and left them with less money to spend on marketing and customer acquisition on platforms like WM.\u2022 I have increasingly come to believe that we are facing a high probability of recession and there is just a broad deterioration in the macro environment. This means we need to position ourselves to weather a potentially protracted storm to be well positioned for potential worsening of consumer demand.&nbsp;There are certainly lessons I will learn from this, and we will continue to do the best we can to grow and guide the business for employees, clients and investors. In regard to the slowdown of end markets, I was wrong in predicting that this would bottom out at the start of the year and that we would start to see a recovery.&nbsp; Instead, we saw the combination of consumers feeling a recessionary pinch in their wallet running up against retailers that were holding prices steady despite falling wholesale prices.&nbsp; In time, more licenses, lower taxes and better retailer pricing will help solve that, but that still needs to happen.I can't express enough the gratitude I have for the contributions of those we had to part ways with today, and as we come out on the other side of this turbulence, we would very much like to find ways to bring teammates back to the company.For those of us who are continuing with WM, I know today's news is painful and scary. While I can assure you that a lot of thought went into how to save costs and better streamline our teams, it doesn't lessen the sting. Please know that we sized these cost reductions at a level to help ensure we had a buffer against further market deterioration so that we could provide better stability on the path forward. We have now put ourselves in a better position to grow and do so profitably. The future continues to get brighter for cannabis legalization, and the growth opportunity for Weedmaps is outsized with new cannabis markets and new cannabis licenses ahead. This means that we need to pull together and focus on delivering the right solutions that clients need at a very rapid pace. For those of you that are ready to run fast and build something great, we can truly revolutionize this industry, and I look forward to building that future together.All of the executive team and managers will be organizing team meetings throughout the day, and we will provide more color at our upcoming all-hands.Thanks,ChrisIf you have a tip or were affected by recent layoffs in the cannabis industry, reach out to this reporter via email (jberke@businessinsider.com), Twitter direct message (@jfberke), or LinkedIn.

The company confirmed to Insider that it laid off on August 2 a \"small\" number of US staff.&nbsp; The CEO said in a memo that FuboTV will focus more on \"fewer priorities\" and \"profitable growth.\" FuboTV has laid off a number of staffers in the US, the streaming-TV company confirmed to Insider.&nbsp; The company said in a statement that it made on August 2 a \"small workforce reduction\" in light of the economic downturn.The statement said: \"The quickly deteriorating macroeconomic environment, coupled with the increasing level of uncertainty, is impacting all companies. FuboTV continues to focus on cost savings and taking a conservative approach to growth. As part of this, the company made a small workforce reduction across its U.S. business today. While not welcome, this reduction is an opportunity for Fubo to re-examine key initiatives and focus on profitable growth in support of its long-term vision.\"FuboTV told staff about the layoffs in a memo from CEO David Gandler that was viewed by Insider. Impacted employees would be invited by 10 a.m. EST on August 2 to meet with management and the layoffs would be effective August 15, according to the memo.\"To support the long term vision and ensure financial flexibility for the company, we have made the very difficult decision to reduce headcount across U.S. domestic business units,\" Gandler said in the memo. The layoffs come as FuboTV is scheduled to report its Q2 financial results on Thursday after market close.The sports-focused pay-TV and gambling operator went public in 2020. It had a divisive run as a meme-stock from late 2020 to 2021, after revealing plans to expand into the red-hot sports betting sector. But the company is not yet profitable and Wall Street has been harsh to both media and sports stocks without a healthy bottom line amid the economic downturn.FuboTV ended 2021 with $638 million in revenue, a 144% increase from the year before, driven by its pay-TV subscriptions and advertising. And it narrowed its net loss 37% year over year to about $383 million. But the streaming company's net loss then doubled year over year during Q1 to $140.8 million, on $242 million in revenue.Shares of FuboTV opened at $2.46 on the morning of August 2, down roughly 80% year to date, compared with the S&amp;P 500's 14% dip during that time.\"While we certainly don't welcome these cuts, this is an opportunity to re-examine our initiatives, double down on our priorities and focus on profitable growth,\" Gandler said in the memo. \"By focusing more on fewer priorities, and with everyone stepping up to the challenge, we must increase our productivity on what truly moves the needle for the company.\" Read the full memo that FuboTV sent to staff:Subject: Organizational UpdateTeam, While FuboTV was founded on an idea - to give consumers access to global sports content streamed through a premium user experience at a fair price - Alberto and I, alongside our co-founder Sung Ho Choi, could never have made it a reality without the perseverance and drive of many dedicated, hard-working and talented people. We have always been grateful that you have supported our vision from the very beginning.Because we have achieved many things together, I always want to be transparent with you. So, it is with a heavy heart that I communicate some bad news today.As you know, all growth stage companies, and the broader tech sector overall, have been facing financial challenges due to macroeconomic concerns and an increasing level of uncertainty. Fubo is unfortunately not immune. We have worked hard over the last few months to achieve cost savings by cutting unnecessary expenses across the company but, regrettably, we need to do more. To support the long term vision and ensure financial flexibility for the company, we have made the very difficult decision to reduce headcount across U.S. domestic business units. Employees impacted by the reduction will receive an invitation by 10am ET today to meet with management, and will transition from the company effective August 15. Please support your colleagues in this transition. I am here to help them in any way I can.I want to be clear that this reduction is not reflective of individual performance. We made these changes today solely to ensure the company is stronger from a financial perspective and to support our path to profitability. Various factors were considered when deciding who would be impacted by this reorganization. There are no further reductions planned at this time.This has been an extremely difficult decision made by myself and the senior leadership team. I have always been proud that we have never previously initiated any layoffs at Fubo. I always found a way for Fubo to persevere despite any financial challenges we faced. However, it is no longer my decision alone. There are a significant number of external forces at play here now that we are a public company. Senior leaders will meet with their teams today and, in the upcoming days, they will further take their teams through the organizational changes and team realignments. They will set forth very focused efforts around key organizational priorities. I am also here to help you in any way I can during this process.While we certainly don't welcome these cuts, this is an opportunity to re-examine our initiatives, double down on our priorities and focus on profitable growth. By focusing more on fewer priorities, and with everyone stepping up to the challenge, we must increase our productivity on what truly moves the needle for the company. We need to make sure that Fubo is still the innovative, fast-moving and nimble organization that we were at the beginning, always operating with a clear sense of urgency to deliver on our goals.Our direction remains clear: providing our customers with a best-in-class user experience that allows them to enjoy and interact with aggregated sports, news and entertainment content. I have no doubt that we can achieve this if we work together and commit to executing on our goals. I look forward to doing this with you. I will host a meeting on Wednesday for U.S. employees only to answer any questions.DavidGot a tip about FuboTV?

        "Extracted Article": "OnlyFans has laid off employees in a move to \"reshape certain teams.\" The subscription service known for its adult content experienced immense growth during the pandemic. The platform is the latest creator economy company to conduct layoffs. OnlyFans, the subscription service famous for its adult content, has laid off employees as part of a move to \"reshape certain teams,\" the company said in a statement to Insider. OnlyFans did not specify how many employees were laid off or which divisions were affected.\"While this is the right decision for OnlyFans and our Creator community, we recognize it is difficult for the people who were impacted by this decision,\" the statement said. \"Affected employees have been provided with a generous severance package and career counseling to support their transition period.\" OnlyFans use skyrocketed during the pandemic, when it entered the zeitgeist and even found its way into a Beyonce\u0301 song.Per the company's 2021 financial filings \u2014 the most recent available \u2014 the number of creators on the app grew from 348,000 in 2019 to 1,618,000 in 2020, and the number of \"fans\" grew from 13,478,000 to 82,308,000. Revenue grew from about \u00a344,164,000 (about $53.7 million) in 2019 to about \u00a3283,467,000 (about $345 million) in 2020.The platform has become a lucrative way for many creators to make money. Some adult content creators have earned millions of dollars from subscribers who pay to get access to their photos and videos, as well as to message the creators and receive custom content. In late 2021, the company had a sudden change of leadership, when founder Tim Stokely stepped down as CEO, and Ami Gan, the company's former PR and marketing chief, was named CEO. Stokely and his family had sold the majority of the company to billionaire Leonid Radvinsky in 2018.While other media companies, like Netflix and Roku, have been hit with slowdowns after thriving during the early months of the pandemic, OnlyFans execs said in June that the company had avoided such a downturn.\"We're not experiencing that slowdown,\" Keily Blair, OnlyFans' chief strategy and operations officer, said at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam, CNBC reported. At the same conference, the company's chief financial officer, Lee Taylor, said that the company was increasing its team by 2% to 3% each month. He specifically called out the UK office, saying, \"We are building a team in the UK to help our creators maximize their earnings.\"Currently, however, the company only has one open job listing on LinkedIn, and it is in the US. It did not appear to have job openings listed on its website or other popular job platforms, like Indeed.com.Here is the full statement from OnlyFans on the layoffs: \"OnlyFans regularly reviews our internal structure to ensure we are Creator first in everything we do. As the number of Creators on OnlyFans continues to grow, we recently elected to reshape certain teams to better address the needs of our Creator community. While this is the right decision for OnlyFans and our Creator community, we recognize it is difficult for the people who were impacted by this decision. Affected employees have been provided with a generous severance package and career counseling to support their transition period.\"If you have been affected by layoffs at OnlyFans or have more information, please reach out at Mberg@businessinsider.com."

The Los Angeles Amazon-brand aggregator Boosted Commerce has laid off about 5% of its employees, a person familiar with the matter told Insider.The news comes as several other Amazon aggregators have cut staff since spring, with companies like Suma,&nbsp;Heroes, and the industry heavyweight Thrasio announcing significant staff cuts since April as the sector moves toward consolidation.&nbsp; A Boosted Commerce employee who was laid off earlier this year told Insider several of the employees affected by the latest round of layoffs were \"VP and director level\" and that brand and marketing departments were hit the hardest. The former employee was granted anonymity because they signed a nondisclosure agreement, but their identity is known to Insider.\"Over the past two years, we have acquired 40 businesses and are continuing to look at how to resource to best manage growth across our portfolio,\" Boosted Commerce CEO Keith Richman said in a statement to Insider. \"In examining our second-half initiatives, we decided it would make sense to reallocate investment into different resource buckets. We continue to hire for those roles and areas related to those investments.\" Amazon aggregators were tempting targets for investors and private-equity firms in 2020 and 2021 as e-commerce growth skyrocketed. Aggregators acquire already profitable brands on Amazon and then attempt to optimize them to increase margins. But the market has soured on aggregators as the underlying business model comes into question, with funding for aggregators down 60% in the first half of 2022, according to Marketplace Pulse.A spokesperson for Boosted Commerce said the aggregator continued to acquire brands and that the company was far from struggling, adding that Boosted had hired a new chief financial officer, Martin Dunstheimer, at the end of June.&nbsp;Boosted has raised $380 million in outside funding to date, according to Marketplace Pulse."

        "Extracted Article": "Lunchbox offers digital ordering, loyalty, and marketing services for restaurants. The startup is led by industry provocateur Nabeel Alamgir, who got his start as a New York busboy.&nbsp; On Thursday, the CEO told Insider that the company had grown \"bloated\" and had to cut 60 employees. Lunchbox, a New York-based food-tech startup whose CEO is known for speaking against the anti-restaurant tactics of delivery apps like Grubhub and DoorDash, laid off 33% of its employees Thursday. The company, which has raised $72 million in less than three years, went from 180 to 120 full-time employees on Thursday. One-third were notified in a Zoom call. The other 40 workers were sent messages to their personal emails,&nbsp;Lunchbox CEO and cofounder Nabeel Alamgir told Insider late Thursday.The layoffs come as food tech investors pressure well-funded startups to trim bloated operations amid turmoil in the capital markets.&nbsp; \"We are all drunk on VC capital, and we needed to sober up,\" Alamgir told Insider.&nbsp;Other food-tech companies downsizing workforces and shoring up operations include&nbsp;Nextbite,&nbsp;ChowNow,&nbsp;Reef Technology,&nbsp;Gopuff, and&nbsp;Sunday. SoftBank backs many of these startups.Alamgir&nbsp;said Lunchbox, like other VC-backed companies, had grown too quickly. He said the layoffs hit all divisions, especially engineers and tech roles. Over the last few months, Lunchbox has acquired companies such as Delish and NovaDine to help automate restaurant onboarding. The CEO said that Lunchbox could operate with a much leaner staff now.&nbsp;\"We were all bloated,\" Alamgir told Insider. \"We no longer are growth at all costs. I'm no longer going to be dependent on investors. We're now working towards being in cash positive.\"Two former employees, one who was laid off from the company this week, said the company spent excessively on marketing and promotional materials such as opening a restaurant in the metaverse and holding its own conferences called Lunchbox Roadshows.\"I think the combination of the industry, seeing reductions, and then just the fiscal behavior of the company, like Nabeel especially, is incredibly irresponsible with his money. He spends everything on brand and marketing and, and cool-looking things and does not spend anything on the product.\" Alamgir said the company's marketing spend was aimed at giving the startup&nbsp; \"a strong brand voice\" amid a slew of competition.\"Excess marketing spend has not been our issue; overhiring throughout the company and being drunk with my peers on VC money has been,\" he said.Alamgir, whose company is entirely remote, said he has Zoom calls set for Friday and the weekend to talk to those who were notified of their job loss by email. He said the company is investing $700,000 in severance packages, and he's personally trying to find jobs for those who got cut.\"It still feels like crap. I'm responsible for a lot of people, and I'm gonna get to have to sleep tonight knowing that.\" Nabeel Alamgir is the CEO of Lunchbox. He laid off 60 people on this birthday - Thursday, July 21, 2022. Lunchbox Well before the coronavirus pandemic swept the nation in March 2020, restaurant operators began sounding the alarm about the economic hardships they face when working with third-party delivery apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alamgir, then a marketing chief at Bareburger, often screamed the loudest. He left Bareburger to start Lunchbox in 2019 to erase what he called \"injustices\" restaurants faced at the hands of delivery apps. Alamgir said it's always been his mission to help mom-and-pop restaurants reduce their dependence on third-party delivery companies.&nbsp;Besides offering online restaurant ordering, Lunchbox's services include loyalty and marketing programs for brands like Mexicue, Fuku, and Bareburger. Last year, Lunchbox launched a&nbsp;NotGrubhub website to promote direct orders from New York restaurants. It also introduced Citizens Go, an online ordering app for virtual brand company C3.&nbsp;However, LunchBox was seeing churn inside the company, former employees said. Restaurants were leaving the startup, including the prominent virtual brand company Virtual Dining Concepts. \"We were shown a scorecard last week during an all-hands that basically said we weren't meeting any goals,\" an employee who was laid off from the company told Insider. Last year,&nbsp;Insider named him among 33 restaurant tech power players. Today, Lunchbox works with nearly 4,000 restaurants and still plans to grow through acquisitions, Alamgir said.In June, Lunchbox began offering its basic online ordering software for free to mom-and-pop restaurants. Despite today's layoffs, that free offer remains, Alamgir said. \"Restaurants need it now more than ever.\"Kristen Hawley contributed to this reporting.&nbsp; This piece has been updated to include comments from former employees."

The company confirmed the job cuts to Insider on Monday.&nbsp; The company is one of several to initiate a round of layoffs amid fears the US is entering a recession. Vimeo is conducting layoffs, a company spokesperson confirmed to Insider on Monday. Vimeo CEO Anijali Sud said the layoffs would impact 6% of the company's workforce in a blog post on Monday. The company employed just over 1,200 workers as of December 2021, according to its annual regulatory filing.&nbsp;\"We are making this decision in order to ensure we come out of this economic downturn a stronger company,\" she said in the post. \"Our people are what makes Vimeo great, and losing any of them is a personal failure that I feel deeply.

Meanwhile, Meta slowed hiring in May and has reportedly warned some staff that cutbacks are coming.Vimeo went public on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2021.&nbsp; The company's main business is software as a service that makes it easier for the average person to create and distribute video content; it's recently been shifting to big corporate clients like Gap, Nike, and Expedia and away from its role as a YouTube alternative.\"Today we are a technology platform, not a viewing destination. We are a B2B solution, not the indie version of YouTube,\" its CEO Anjali Sud wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier this year. As part of that strategy shift, Vimeo notified independent video creators it was sharply increasing the cost of its services, leaving some scrambling for alternatives.Anjali acknowledged the company had some stumbles earlier in its B2B transition but that the problems were fixable through better execution in 2022. She also predicted the company's growth would slow in 2022 as Vimeo transitions to focusing on bigger companies.Have a tip or more information about this story?

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon aggregator startup Heroes quietly cut a fifth of its staff in May, Insider understands. The London-based firm, founded in 2020, acquires and scales top sellers on Amazon. Heroes cited market conditions and potential difficulty raising capital as reasons behind the cuts. Amazon aggregator startup Heroes, which has raised over $300 million in two years, quietly laid off a fifth of its staff in May as the nascent industry attempts to shift from hypergrowth to profitability. Aggregators, or rollups, acquire third-party brands that rely on Amazon infrastructure to store, process, and ship out products. London-based Heroes, founded by brothers Riccardo, Alessio, and Giancarlo Bruni in 2020, joined a bevy of these newly-spawned companies trying to capitalize on an ecommerce boom fueled by the pandemic.The ballooning sector has attracted $15 billion in funding since March 2020, when lockdowns drove a surge in online shopping.&nbsp;Heroes' backers include Cray hill Capital Management, 360 Capital, Fuel Ventures, and Upper 90. The company faces competition from London-based Olsam and Berlin-based firms SellerX and Razor. Heroes cofounder Riccardo Bruni informed staff on May 30 that 20% of the company's 120-strong workforce would be cut, Insider understands. Bruni cited challenging market conditions, a potential global recession, the consequent shift in consumer spending, and potential difficulty raising future capital as the driving forces behind the cuts during a 10am meeting.In a follow-up email seen by Insider, Bruni said the company had come to the \"hard decision\" to restructure the business and reduce its workforce in order to help it become a \"cash-flow positive business.\" He also said the company was \"unfortunately dependent\" on the flow of external capital to enable them to acquire more sellers.The move to slash up to 24 jobs at Heroes was sudden, according to a source familiar with the situation, who said the company had still been focused on growth during an all-hands meeting in April. Heroes had just acquired its first brand with substantial traction off Amazon, which was in bricks and mortar stores, a goal previously made clear by the company. Bruni confirmed the cuts in an interview Friday with Insider. He said the company hired 12 to 18 months in advance and that the slowdown meant Heroes was overstaffed. Layoffs were company-wide but the investment team, which sources deals and acquisitions, was particularly hard hit. Up to five people from a team of 10 lost their job, Bruni said.Those being made redundant were invited to a 1:1 session within half an hour of the cuts being announced. Two to four people were offered different roles within the company when there was a fit, Bruni said. The others being made redundant were instantly cut off from the company's IT and placed on gardening leave \u2013 per advice from a HR consultancy, Bruni added.&nbsp;The Heroes cofounder said the decision to cut staff was not a result of investor pressure and that the people who were let go had \"immensely contributed\" to the startup's success to date. \"But, as a business, we also have a fiduciary duty towards our investors, who trust us as management to take the right decisions,\" he said. \"We felt it was the right decision to go through this round of redundancies and right-size the business.\"Bruni said that no further cuts will be made at Heroes but predicted layoffs across the wider tech ecosystem.\"My view is that we're just seeing the very, very beginning of mass layoffs across the entire industry,\" he said. \"And I'm not talking about the FBA aggregator space but about the industry as an economy as a whole.\" Like other aggregator businesses, Heroes is largely funded by debt. It raised an undisclosed sum in February, according to PitchBook. US heavy hitter Thrasio, which pioneered the business model and has raised a total of $3.4 billion, also announced layoffs in May.Do you work at an aggregator? Got a tip?

The company, which helps creators make and sell merch, has raised $60 million. Spring, the merchandise company formerly known as Teespring, is the latest creator economy startup to lay off employees.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the company laid off a number of staffers across its growth, marketing, and other teams, including some high-level execs, according to multiple people close to the company. Spring confirmed the layoffs to Insider, but did not comment on how many employees were affected.\"Today, we announced a plan to streamline parts of our business saying goodbye to some team members and legacy business functions,\" Chris Lamontagne, CEO of Spring, said in a statement. \"Going forward we are focusing singularly on building the best creator-facing product to create, sell, and fulfill their products to fans. In the current climate, we believe more than ever in our purpose to help individual creators thrive in doing what they love.\" \"It was very swift,\" said one former staffer who was laid off on Tuesday. \"Most of us lost immediate access to Slack.\"Six former staffers, who spoke with Insider on the condition of anonymity to protect career prospects, said they felt the business was facing challenges beyond simply the current economic downturn. Their identities are known to Insider.&nbsp;\"The company, over the last three months, has gone a bunch of different directions,\" said a second former employee laid off this week. \"Doesn't seem like there is sort of a grand vision. It's been a little chaotic.\" \"With the latest layoffs impacting all creator-facing departments ... it's hard to see how Spring can claim itself to be The&nbsp;creator company,\" said a third former employee laid off this week.The San Francisco-based company launched in 2011 as a platform where users could create T-shirts. By 2018, it had begun to focus on making merch for content creators like YouTube stars. The company helps creators with production and distribution, and it has built partnerships with platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram \u2014 as well as other creator economy startups like Linktree and Pietra.&nbsp;In partnership with YouTube, Spring created a \"merch shelf\" feature that lets creators sell merchandise directly below their videos. Spring also has an in-app integration on TikTok for creators to sell their merch directly on the platform. Spring had raised a total of $60 million in funding to date, according to Pitchbook data. Lamontagne told the Information in September 2021 that Spring was eyeing an IPO \"within the next 18 to 24 months.\" At that time, The Information reported that Spring had 450 employees.Earlier this year, Spring poached Meta VP Annelies Jansen to serve as president and COO.Spring is among a slew of other&nbsp;creator economy startups that have laid off employees in the last three months, including Cameo, Jellysmack, and Lightricks."

The startup said it had made the \"very difficult decision\" given the current macroeconomic climate. Insider reported that the company was set to lay off staff previously.&nbsp; Virtual events startup Hopin, which was valued at $7.75 billion during the pandemic, is laying off 242 of its staff in its second wave of job cuts in 2022, confirming earlier reporting from Insider. The cuts equate to around 29% of the company's workforce. Hopin said it had made the \"very difficult decision\" due to the current macroeconomic climate and the need for its events product to \"move forward efficiently.\"\"We're extremely grateful for our departing colleagues and friends and will always appreciate their talent, contributions and impact on Hopin,\" a company spokesman said. \"While we took preventative measures before looking at a more significant restructure, it became necessary to simplify our events business and supporting operations to build a profitable and sustainable company. Hopin's mission has always been to build technology that better connects people, and these changes were made so we can focus on this now more than ever.\"Founded in 2019 by 28-year-old British entrepreneur Johnny Boufarhat, UK-based Hopin offers conferencing software for virtual and hybrid events, with its paid plans ranging from $99 to $799 per month or higher. The firm grew quickly during the pandemic, and attracted $1 billion in venture capital funding from backers on the hunt for future \"winners\" of hybrid work.But this February, Hopin announced it was cutting 12% of staff \u2014 around 138 people \u2014 citing the need for sustainable growth. The company told Insider that those impacted will receive three months of compensation and health benefits and their one-year cliff dropped for stock vesting.&nbsp; The firm employs around 834 people.The cuts come amid a broader cooling in interest in high-risk startups and tech firms. European firms including fast-delivery firm Gorillas, rival Getir, car sales platform Cazoo, and others have all cut jobs in recent months.Hopin faces an additional challenge in the world returning to real-world events, and a possible dropoff in demand for its services.&nbsp;When the startup&nbsp;raised a big $450 million round in August last year, the startup&nbsp;had&nbsp;approximately $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), and around 800 employees. It also claimed to be hosting around 15,000 events a month on its platform.&nbsp;But currently there are just&nbsp;158 events listed for the month of July and 54 for August. Hopin is backed by major investors like General Catalyst, Tiger Global, Coatue, Accel, and IVP. Its young founder and CEO Boufarhat switched his residency to Switzerland weeks shortly before the last set of job cuts. A paper billionaire thanks to Hopin's multibillion-dollar valuation, he has cemented his wealth by selling $195 million of his own shares.The firm remains privately held. According to data from Zanbato, a platform for trading private shares, the market price for Hopin's shares fell 57% during the first half of 2022."

Electric-vehicle startup Canoo has laid off some workers this year as its deadline for starting vehicle production approaches, six sources familiar with the changes told Insider. A company spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and said the move is part of Canoo's strategy to execute its plans, but employees impacted say uncertainty is brewing. The spokesperson said Canoo has let 58 employees go this year, which is about 6% of its approximate 940-person headcount. The spokesperson also said 313 employees have been hired this year, and that it is still hiring.Canoo has cut personnel in areas like talent sourcing and acquisition, marketing, brand design, and engineering, according to current and former employees with direct knowledge of the situation, along with LinkedIn posts from those who say they've been laid off.&nbsp; Sources were granted anonymity, as they are bound by NDAs or are unauthorized to speak publicly about the company.

A recent report from local paper Tulsa World said those plans are on hold, citing a local official.&nbsp; The reality of the difficulty of making that many vehicles by late this year is setting in, sources told Insider.\"It was chaotic to say the least,\" an employee who says they were just terminated from the company told Insider.The startup has also lost top talent and sources allege it missed supplier payments this year. Meanwhile, its stock price has dropped 90% from an all-time high of $22 in December 2020 to around $2. Canoo reported a \"going concern\" statement about its financial viability at the end of the first-quarter but announced a new plan to raise much-needed capital, including $50 million in funding via a committed private investment in public equity from Aquila's firm, Aquila Family Ventures, and a $250 million equity purchase agreement with financing partner Yorkville Advisors. The plan also included filing a $300 million universal shelf registration, allowing the company to issue securities like common stock in the future.The company's burn rate is more than $100 million a quarter.&nbsp;Are you a current or former Canoo employee?

        "Extracted Article": "Martech company Sprinklr recently laid off at least 50 staffers in its global marketing department. The firm says it is restructuring the unit under its new CMO as it focuses on more efficient growth. The cuts come amid a slew of recent layoffs in the tech sector. Sprinklr, the publicly traded customer experience software platform, laid off dozens of its employees late last month, Insider has learned. The cuts affected at least 50 roles in the company's global marketing department, sources with knowledge of the situation said. Impacted employees were notified late last month.A spokesperson for the company, which is headquartered in New York, confirmed the layoffs, but declined to comment on the exact number of staffers let go. More than 4,000 people on LinkedIn list that they currently work at Sprinklr, though this likely includes part-time roles. \"Sprinklr made the business decision to reorganize our marketing function under the leadership of our new CMO, which resulted in the elimination of some roles in marketing,\" said a Sprinklr spokesperson in a statement.Founded in 2009, Sprinklr offers clients including L'Or\u00e9al, UBS, and IKEA software that helps them manage their relationships with their customers and market to them on digital channels like social media sites, messaging apps, and their own websites and call centers. The company generates revenue by selling subscription software licenses.The new CMO, Arun Pattabhiraman, joined Sprinklr in May this year from India-based business-to-business software company Freshworks, where he was the firm's chief growth officer. News of Sprinklr's cuts mark the latest in a slew of tech layoffs this year, with many firms citing a slowdown in growth, increasing labor costs, rising interest rates, and fears about an impending recession. More than 22,000 US tech workers were laid off between the start of the year and the end of June, according to Crunchbase News.\"Our first priority is to support those affected with the greatest care and respect,\" the Sprinklr spokesperson's statement continued. \"We then must create a unified marketing function, hire the right roles in the right areas, and organize marketing to continue to help deliver profitable growth to the business.\"Sprinklr beat its own guidance by posting a 31% lift in revenue year-on-year in its most-recent quarter, but the company warned that this growth could slow. Sprinklr execs said the company faces \"tougher compares for the remainder of the year,\" which reflect its strong 2021 performance but also the challenges of the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Its operating loss widened to $23 million in the three months to April, up from $10.5 million in the year-ago quarter&nbsp; Sprinklr's stock is trading down by more than a third in the year to date.On the company's June earnings call, Sprinklr CEO Ragy Thomas said that while the company hadn't seen a slowdown in demand for its product, there had been a recent uptick in conversations with customers about \"uncertainty and pullback\" more generally.\"We are heavily focused on efficient and profitable growth, and restructuring marketing under our new CMO will enable us to right-size our program spend to generate sales pipeline and growth at scale,\" said the Sprinklr spokesperson in a statement."

It was founded in 2019 to let stars like Paul McCartney and Addison Rae communicate with fans via text message. The company has raised $90 million in venture funding from Salesforce Ventures and others. Community, a platform that lets influencers and brands communicate with fans over text message, laid off about 40 staffers earlier this month, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. The platform, an&nbsp;SMS reimagining of a classic email-marketing tool, gives public figures and companies \u2013 including Eminem, Addison Rae, Paul McCartney, and Stacey Abrams \u2013 a unique phone number where fans can opt in to receive content and promotions.&nbsp;Influencers can also glean location and demographic information about their followers. Then, they can send messages to various subsets of their communities, or even on a one-to-one basis \u2013 to wish a fan happy birthday, for instance. Community monetizes by charging influencers and businesses a fee, which is based on frequency of use and the size of the following.&nbsp; Community launched in 2019, and in April 2021 raised $40 million from Salesforce Ventures, the software company's investment arm, The Wall Street Journal reported. That brought its total funding to $90 million, with other backers including Twilio, Live Nation Entertainment, and the Sony Innovation Fund.At the time, the company said it had 6,000 creators on its platform and 26 million users who had signed up to receive text messages.The company has said its main point of differentiation is enabling influencers and brands to connect with fans directly, without the deterrence of social media algorithms. It isn't the only company betting on text messaging. Other players in the field include Subtext; SimpleTexting (a division of MessageMedia); and Mailchimp, which last year acquired the text-marketing startup Chatitive.Community is not the first company at the intersection of tech and media to have layoffs amid a challenging economic climate. In addition to Netflix and Peloton, food content purveyor Food52 laid off 20 of its 200 employees in early April, while celebrity shoutout platform Cameo laid off 87 staffers in May. And creator economy startup Jellysmack laid off 8% of its staff earlier this month."

        "Extracted Article": "Weee! laid off around 150 employees including its entire marketing team. Its CFO is also leaving the company. CEO Larry Liu told staff the cuts would extend its runway another year as it eyes an IPO. Weee!, the Asian and Hispanic grocery delivery service, recently cut 150 employees including several top executives, as the startup, recently valued at $4 billion, faces a tight funding market and broader ecommerce slowdown. The layoffs affected 10% of the company's workforce but were targeted mostly at its corporate ranks, including the marketing team which was almost entirely laid off, according to three people familiar with the matter. CEO Larry Liu also shook up his executive ranks, with his VPs of marketing and human resources out and his CFO, Ankur Shah, set to leave in the coming weeks, these people said.Weee!'s retrenchment is the latest in a wave of cutbacks within the grocery delivery world. In the last few months, rapid delivery startups like GoPuff, Gorillas, and Getir laid off hundreds of employees. Earlier this year, Instacart lowered its valuation to reflect the less exuberant economic environment. Weee! doesn't do rapid delivery and focuses on a subset of the market of people looking to buy Asian and Hispanic groceries, but the company still benefitted from the pandemic ecommerce boom. It has raised over $800 million since it launched in 2015 and earlier this year announced a $425 million Series E funding round led by Softbank which valued the company at $4.1 billion. Its other investors include Tiger Global, DST and Blackstone.Liu told Insider in a statement that the cuts were not a reaction to a business slowdown or the economic environment, but instead were part of its long-term strategy:\"With this reorganization, Weee!'s long-term outlook continues to be strong as we meet the needs of growing ethnic populations in the U.S. along with diversifying consumer tastes more broadly,\" he said. \"Following our recent highly successful Series E funding round, the company is well-positioned to thrive in a variety of market conditions as we continue to focus on long-term growth objectives.\" Liu declined to comment on the status of his CFO beyond saying Shah was currently serving in the role.&nbsp;Weee!'s growth had been good. Last year Weee! brought in around $400 million in revenue, double the previous year, as Insider reported. But since then its growth rate has slowed. Early last year, Weee! projected it could bring in $1 billion in revenue in 2022. But more recent forecasts put annual revenue closer to $600 to $700 million according to two people familiar with the matter.The layoffs also reflect Liu's desire to pull back on its high spending, high growth strategy and assert more control, people familiar with the matter said. Historically, Liu had run the business with a close eye on costs. He would approve purchases that were greater than $2,000. That changed as Weee! raised nine-figure rounds in 2021 and 2022 and the company built up its marketing team and hired a handful of senior executives.&nbsp;In announcing the layoffs internally, Liu made clear that it was back to basics when it came to operations and marketing. He also told his staff that cutting costs would help extend Weee!'s runway by a year\u2014 giving it three years of capital. Furthermore, he doesn't intend to raise more private financing; its next fundraising will instead come via an IPO, according to one person briefed on his statements.Liu told Insider that the cuts were designed to remove the need for any future private funding, but he had not ruled it out.

Jellysmack's leadership also told employees it planned to cease some international operations. Here's the email Jellysmack leadership team sent to employees on Thursday.&nbsp; Jellysmack laid off 8% of its employees on Thursday as part of a larger restructuring that affected several departments across the startup.&nbsp; The creator economy startup has raised over $991 million, according to Pitchbook, from backers including SoftBank, Unilever Ventures, and Highland Europe. The company, which identifies creator content that can be recut and distributed on platforms like Facebook and Snapchat to make ad revenue, had most recently set aside $500 million to buy the licensing rights to influencers' back catalogs in January, and doubled down on food creators, signing 23 of them in 2022 alone.\"In light of the current macroeconomic volatility, Jellysmack \u2013 like many other technology companies \u2013 anticipates a short-term decline in ad spending,\" a Jellysmack spokesperson told Insider in a statement. \"We have made the difficult decision to reduce the size of the Jellysmack team by 8% to focus on areas of growth that bring the most added value for our creator partners.\" A company-wide email sent on Thursday signaled Jellysmack's plans, which include shutting down commercial operations in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and curbing its investment in marketing.\"We will be reducing our investment in areas of the company that are not driving sustainable growth for us and for our creator partners,\" the cofounders wrote in the email.Impacted employees were then notified through a meeting with a senior leader or HR staffer.&nbsp; The company continues to employ over 1,000 employees post-layoffs.&nbsp;\"It came as quite a shock as there was no indication prior to today,\" said a person close to the company, who asked to not be identified to protect career prospects. Their identity is known to Insider. \"I'm very disappointed. I quite enjoyed my time at the company and was excited to be a part of a fast-growing organization in a very fluid field.\"&nbsp;Jellysmack's layoffs come as the tech sector braces for an economic downturn. Roughly 16,000 tech workers lost their jobs or saw job offers revoked in May alone at companies such as Carbon Health, Loom, Coinbase, and IRL. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also told company executives in early June to \"pause all hiring worldwide\" and reduce employee headcount by 10%.&nbsp; Here's the email Jellysmack's leadership team sent all employees:&nbsp;From: Michael Philippe&nbsp;Subject: Message from the founders Dear team,As you probably already know, we are seeing signs of an economic slowdown that is impacting technology companies globally. As a result, our platform partners anticipate decreases in ad spending.This will have implications for the entire Creator Economy, and Jellysmack is no exception. To ensure the mid and long-term success of the company and position ourselves for growth, it is essential we take action now.&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have come to the very hard decision to reduce the size of the Jellysmack team by 8%. This is a difficult and sad choice that no founder wants to make, but we know it's above all, difficult for the team members leaving Jellysmack.&nbsp;Focusing our business strategy Our long-term mission remains the same: to help creators Go Bigger. We will continue to pursue this ambition by focusing our efforts where we are seeing the most success and bringing the most value to creators.&nbsp;Therefore, we will be reducing our investment in areas of the company that are not driving sustainable growth for us and for our creator partners.This means: Narrowing our footprint in regions where we are seeing little tractionWe are shutting down our commercial operations in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. Some countries will be asked to narrow their focus to a more limited number of services such as India, South Korea, and Japan.Sunsetting parts of the business that don't bring the most immediate value to our creator partners We will be closing JellyX and reducing our Marketing investment globally.Increasing our focus on areas of the business that help us deliver on our missionWe will be right-sizing teams across the organization to support this more focused business strategy.&nbsp; What's next for impacted employeesWe are committed to supporting team members through this transition in a thoughtful and respectful way. All departing employees will be offered a severance package and provided job search assistance from our People team, should they wish to use it.&nbsp;For U.S. team members, we can provide immediate clarity. Within the next few hours, those leaving Jellysmack will receive a calendar invite for a meeting with a manager and an HR business partner. The details of individual severance packages will be outlined at this time and today will be the final working day for impacted employees.&nbsp; For team members outside of the U.S., this announcement and its implications will be conducted in accordance with local laws. Within the next few hours, impacted employees will receive a calendar invite for a meeting with a manager and an HR business partner. During this meeting, managers and HRBPs will be sharing the next steps.&nbsp;For those continuing on the Jellysmack journey&nbsp;Jellysmack's mission remains intact, and our strategy and ambition remain the same. We know we can rely on our strong foundations: our culture, our values, our DNA. These will guide us through our journey, so we can keep building the future of the Creator Economy. Over the next few days and weeks, we will share more details about supporting organizational changes that will help streamline our operations and make us a more focused and efficient company.&nbsp;In addition, a global all-hands meeting will be held at the end of the month to share more about our vision for the future, and to answer questions you may have about the actions we've taken to ensure Jellysmack's lasting success.&nbsp;To those leaving Jellysmack We want to thank you for all your hard work and your commitment to helping our company grow. Whatever your role, you made Jellysmack, Jellysmack and we're extremely grateful for that.

ID.me grew rapidly during the pandemic, hiring nearly 1,500 people and winning contracts with the IRS and state unemployment agencies. ID.me, an identity verification company that has done work for the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, and dozens of state unemployment agencies, said it would be laying off staff on Tuesday, Insider has learned.&nbsp; In an email to staff, CEO Blake Hall said the job cuts were because of a volatile economy and push for profitability.\"While ID.me has experienced tremendous growth, we are not immune from the difficult market conditions that have negatively affected the tech industry,\" Hall said in the email, which was obtained by Insider. \"To remain in control of our future, we must reorient the business around core products and establish an organic path to profitability.\" Hall said that affected employees would get an invitation to join a meeting within 30 minutes of his email, informing them of the layoff. Remaining employees were invited to join a town hall meeting that afternoon. A current employee who attended the town hall told Insider that Hall did not answer any questions from employees during the meeting.&nbsp;In a statement to Insider, the company's outside spokesperson, Patrick Dorton, declined to comment on how many employees were affected by the layoffs but claimed they only affected corporate employees, and not any of the customer support staff, known internally as Trusted Referees. According to seven current and former employees,&nbsp;the layoffs affected some&nbsp;customer service managers, senior members of the support team, and quality assurance auditors.\"With economic headwinds beginning to be felt across many industries, as good stewards of our company we must position ID.me for long-term success,\" Dorton said. \"ID.me is committed to investing its resources wisely to ensure its customers continue to be properly served.\" ID.me has grown rapidly since 2020, hiring nearly 1,500 employees and winning dozens of lucrative contracts with state unemployment agencies, the Social Security Administration, and the IRS in less than two years, Insider previously reported. In that time, it expanded its real-estate footprint and opened a new office in Tampa, Florida, in addition to its headquarters in McLean, Virginia.The company closed its most recent venture funding round, a $100 million Series C led by Viking Global Investors, in March 2021, valuing the company at $1.47 billion. It took on an additional $100 million in debt financing from Fortress Investment Group in September, according to PitchBook.ID.me's most profitable products, according to one person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss company financials, are its discount programs for veterans, nurses, doctors, and first responders. These workers qualify for a discount at major retailers and restaurants after verifying their identity and work status on ID.me. As reported in an Insider investigation, customer service workers hired during ID.me's rapid expansion described long helpline queues, user-data security lapses, and insufficient training to do their jobs or protect their mental health.People who had difficulty getting verified on ID.me could get locked out of their unemployment benefits or IRS child tax credit money. Hundreds of veterans lodged complaints to VA helplines that they had been barred access to healthcare, housing, and education benefits because of issues with ID.me, Insider previously reported.Employees who lost their jobs on Tuesday were told they would receive a severance package of up to four months of pay followed by two months of paid COBRA health coverage, according to two people. One of these people said that ID.me's leadership had asked employees earlier this year to tabulate the work their teams were doing, including estimates of time spent and the fiscal impact of individual employees' work. The company's chief financial officer, Stephen Benedict, and VP of engineering, Alexei Czeskis, assured employees that this assignment was not an indication of coming layoffs, this person said..&nbsp;\"It seems that last part was not true,\" they said.

Along the way, my commitment has been to do what is best for ID.me's customers, employees, and users.While ID.me has experienced tremendous growth, we are not immune from the difficult market conditions that have negatively impacted the tech industry.

Tech startups have faced a wave of layoffs as valuations drop and VC cash dries up. Sendoso, the SoftBank-backed marketing platform that lets companies send gifts to business connections, is the latest startup to succumb to layoffs amid a broader job cull in the tech industry. The startup on Monday laid off about 100 people from its 700-employee workforce, a Sendoso spokesperson confirmed to Insider. Layoffs affected employees in the US and Ireland across the company's business units, the spokesperson said.In a statement to Insider, Sendoso chief people officer Alexis Kavazanjian said that in the last month, market volatility and global crises have impacted the technology market. \"Because of this, Sendoso has come to the tough decision to adjust our operations, which requires a reduction in roles for some of our employees,\" Kavazanjian said, adding that the company will offer support for laid-off employees while \"ensuring that the company moves forward in a way that is best for our partners, customers, and future of the business.\"Sendoso announced in April that it was moving its headquarters from San Francisco to a new, $40 million office in Phoenix, Arizona.The startup&nbsp;is the latest in a long line of startups and tech firms that have laid off employees in recent weeks, affecting more than 20,000 workers so far in 2022. Superhuman, Main Street, Cameo, On Deck, and Robinhood recently cut staff, while countless other tech firms and startups are freezing or slowing hiring. The layoffs are coming as share prices for public tech companies have plummeted while VC funding has dried up, with investors instructing their startups to cut costs and extend their runways to avoid a \"death spiral.\"More than 21,000 tech workers have been laid off so far this year, with 16,800 people dismissed in May alone, according to the online layoffs-tracker Layoffs.fyi.Sendoso most recently completed a $100 million Series C funding round in September led by SoftBank Vision Fund. The Japanese investor, which has bet big on winners such as DoorDash and ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has sunk money into former startup darlings that have imploded, like WeWork, Better, and Greensill Capital. View, a SoftBank-backed smart glass company, has burned cash and risks being delisted by the Stock exchange after becoming one of the worst SPAC deals ever.&nbsp;"

The Tiger-backed startup has raised $126 million in funding and was last valued at $825 million. The wave of tech layoffs has reached even the pandemic darlings of the productivity sector. Email startup Superhuman has laid off 23 employees, representing about 22% of its workforce, CEO Rahul Vohra announced on Twitter on Friday. \"We are doing all we can to support them, including generous severance, mental health support, health insurance throughout the year, and job search assistance,\" Vohra added in a follow-up tweet. Vohra also offered to help those laid off to find a new job.Superhuman amassed a cult-like following among tech founders and investors for pledging to make email faster. The app uses keyboard shortcuts and pre-written messages to help users churn through their inbox in less time. Backed by Tiger Global, the startup has raised $126 million in funding, most recently at a $825 million valuation. It had its share of critics, to be sure. A Superhuman subscription costs $30 a month, which led some people to mock the app as luxury software for the tech elite. And until recently, people needed an invite from an existing user to join.For years, Superhuman elicited gripes from tech-savvy professionals that the app wasn't compatible with Microsoft Outlook, one of the world's largest email services with nearly 345 million paid users. People needed a Gmail email address to use the app. Superhuman finally arrived on Outlook in May, a major milestone for the five-year-old startup that had the potential to unleash hundreds of millions of paid subscribers.&nbsp;The integration came about a year after Superhuman fired up enterprise sales, where businesses pay for licenses directly or through reimbursement.The layoffs raise questions about the success of the launch, which had the potential to turbocharge business. The layoffs are part of cutbacks sweeping the tech industry as venture capitalists slow down their pace of investing and startups slash their burn. More than 21,000 tech workers have been laid off so far this year, with 16,800 people dismissed in May alone, according to the online layoffs-tracker Layoffs.fyi.Have a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "Supply-chain startup Stord laid off 59 employees Thursday, the company told Insider.&nbsp; The startup announced an additional $120 million in funding and a $1.3 billion valuation on May 10.&nbsp; Laid-off employees told Insider the news was a shock due to the recent funding and a high valuation. The wave of tech layoffs has reached the supply-chain sector. Flexible-warehousing startup Stord laid off 59 employees \u2014 about 8% of its 700-strong workforce \u2014 Thursday, the company confirmed to Insider. The layoffs came from multiple business units within the company, a spokesperson said via email.&nbsp; Founded in 2015, Stord is a cloud-based platform that connects hundreds of independent warehouses to a network so shippers can keep inventory close to consumers without leasing space. It began offering trucking and e-commerce-fulfillment services during the pandemic.&nbsp;\"While this was a challenging day for everyone, the company remains in an incredibly strong position as brands continue to invest in the technology and logistics solutions they need to meet customer expectations and fuel growth,\" a spokesperson told Insider via email. \"Stord has achieved record revenue growth, is on pace for greater growth in Q2, and has an extremely strong balance sheet with the additional capital raised in May.\"&nbsp; Stord announced an additional $120 million in Series D funding less than a month ago, which brought its Series D total to $210 million. Franklin Templeton Investments led the round and was top of mind for some of the laid-off employees.&nbsp;\"Our CEO specifically came out and said this is our war chest \u2014 this is going to hold us through any tough times,\" a laid-off Stord employee, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their future job prospects, told Insider Thursday.Stord notified affected employees Wednesday night of a meeting the next morning and some started to expect layoffs when the calendar invite for the meeting said it was only scheduled for 15 minutes.&nbsp; During the meeting \u2014 conducted on Zoom with no visible participants \u2014 Stord cofounders Sean Henry and Jacob Boudreau said they'd hired too quickly, according to two affected workers. Ahead of the new funding announcement on May 10, the founders told multiple media outlets they would reach 1,000 employees by the end of the year.&nbsp;\"We all got off the phone very confused because they had just raised all that money a few weeks ago and had a $1.3 billion valuation,\" said another laid-off employee speaking on the condition of anonymity.&nbsp;Stord's spokesperson said the company \"has a stronger balance sheet and more capital than ever,\" and that \"running a responsible business requires regular reviews of our entire business to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible. Stord is in a position of strength and set up for long term success.\" Stord will continue to pay laid-off employees until June 15, when the firm will give them severance packages with amounts based on the time they worked with the company, Stord confirmed. The company will also provide \"career assistance, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, and networking on an ongoing basis,\" according to the spokesperson.During the pandemic, customers and funders took a new interest in supply-chain tech, specifically warehousing startups like Stord. The company entered the pandemic with less than $20 million in funding and reached 2022 with a fundraising total above $300 million.&nbsp;Santosh Sankar, an early Stord investor and managing partner at Dynamo Ventures \u2014 which led the company's seed round \u2014 told Insider the business still has \"impressive fundamentals.\"&nbsp; \"Parting ways with colleagues is hard,\" Sankar told Insider via email. \"But Stord is in a strong position and continues to make the right investments for sustainable success.\"&nbsp;Have you been laid off by a supply-chain tech startup?

The layoffs are concentrated in its maps unit, due to improvements in TomTom's mapmaking automation.&nbsp; 500 employees will be affected by the restructuring, according to a press release. Geolocation tech firm TomTom is laying off 500 employees in its maps unit after engineering investments improved its automated mapmaking platform, the company said. It announced the decision in a company press release published on Wednesday.&nbsp;The number of maps unit employees affected is equivalent to around 10% of the company's total global headcount.&nbsp; \"Higher levels of automation and the integration of a variety of digital sources will result in fresher and richer maps, with wider coverage,\" said TomTom CEO Harold Goddijn in the statement.&nbsp;A TomTom spokesperson told Insider: \"The intended reorganization is spread over more than 20 countries globally. We will not comment on the specific country by country impact as we want to ensure a diligent process with all parties involved.\"It added: \"When hiring, the potential redundant profiles are considered thoroughly, to see whether these could be a match, before turning to the market.\" The company said it would assist any employees involved, where possible, to find and apply for new positions within TomTom.TomTom's stock has fallen nearly 19% year-to-date. Tech companies have been battered by stock sell-offs as yearly revenue projections have been downgraded and investors have gotten jitters.Once best-known for its satellite car navigation, Amsterdam-based TomTom revamped its strategy in 2019, including to cater to self-driving car mapping technology. It has signed a string of partnerships with major car brands to provide HD maps to their systems, amounting to a roughly 60% market share in HD maps when measured by total car volume, according to a corporate pitch deck. It also has ongoing partnerships with Uber, Microsoft, and Apple Maps, according to Venture Beat.&nbsp;TomTom joins a rapidly growing list of tech companies slashing their workforces, including European tech darling Klarna, a \"buy now, pay later\" fintech that laid off around 700 of its employees this month. Related stories Streaming giant Netflix, delivery startup Gorilla, and retail investing app Robinhood have also made recent cuts to their workforces.&nbsp;"

        "Extracted Article": "Eaze quietly laid off as many as 25 employees on Wednesday. The layoffs include members of its engineering and live operations team. In a statement to Insider, Eaze said the cuts were related to a merger that closed in January. Cannabis tech startup Eaze quietly laid off as many as 25 employees, Insider has learned. The layoffs took place on Wednesday, and the cuts included members of Eaze's engineering team and live operations team, which handles its delivery service. Three former employees described the job cuts to Insider. They asked not to be identified to preserve relationships and protect future job opportunities in the industry.\"While it is always a difficult decision to part with dedicated employees, we must make changes in order to be successful in the maturing cannabis market,\" Eaze CEO Ro Choy said in a statement to Insider on Friday. \"These changes position Eaze for long-term growth as we continue to focus on providing a high quality delivery and shopping experience for Eaze customers and partners in California, Colorado, Michigan and Florida.\" Eaze began as a cannabis delivery service in the Bay Area and has weathered a few tumultuous years of executive churn, layoffs, and business pivots.The latest layoffs come after quietly cutting jobs in October and again in February, Insider has learned. The February layoffs affected roughly 20 employees, including Eaze's government affairs and communications team, its legal team, and other divisions, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company laid off 36 employees in 2019.Eaze has also seen a parade of long-tenured senior executives depart in the past few months, the people said.&nbsp; In August of last year, the startup \u2014 once a darling of the young cannabis industry \u2014 acquired Green Dragon, a chain of cannabis dispensaries with storefronts in Colorado and Florida, in an all-stock deal. The acquisition was an effort to pivot into selling cannabis itself rather than just delivering it, as Insider has reported.&nbsp;In its statement to Insider, Eaze said that the cuts were related to the Green Dragon acquisition, which closed in January.\"As a result of the merger with Green Dragon, Eaze has eliminated a number of positions from various departments to increase efficiencies within the merged company operations,\" the statement read. In 2020, Eaze shifted to running its own dispensaries, rather than partnering with other companies, Insider&nbsp;previously reported. The company was forced to pare back expectations that it would sell over $1 billion worth of cannabis that year as well.Eaze's struggles aren't unusual in the broader tech industry. During the earlier part of the pandemic, the US technology industry boomed. Firms like Amazon and Apple reached record-breaking market caps, while private companies received large funding injections from venture capital firms loaded with cash. But now, an ugly downturn has hit the industry with layoffs brewing.Eaze CEO Rogelio Choy told Insider in August that the company was looking to raise a $75 million Series E funding round at a $700 million pre-money valuation, with 80% of the capital already committed as of last August. In its statement to Insider, Eaze said that it closed its Series E round in January with $65 million in funding.&nbsp; Read Eaze's full statement below:As part of a strategic shift integrating retail with delivery, Eaze Technologies, a leading cannabis delivery company based in California, finalized the acquisition of Colorado-based Green Dragon early this year. With 16 dispensary locations in Colorado and an MMTC license in Florida, Eaze Technologies will focus on the build out of its Florida footprint including over 25 stores in 2022, and a 400,000 square foot cultivation and manufacturing facility.As a result of the merger with Green Dragon, Eaze has eliminated a number of positions from various departments to increase efficiencies within the merged company operations. \"While it is always a difficult decision to part with dedicated employees, we must make changes in order to be successful in the maturing cannabis market\", said Ro Choy, CEO of Eaze. \"These changes position Eaze for long-term growth as we continue to focus on providing a high quality delivery and shopping experience for Eaze customers and partners in California, Colorado, Michigan and Florida.\"By the end of 2022, the company plans to continue to expand its retail footprint after acquiring two retail locations in Southern California, which operate under the name Eaze Dispensary. In January of 2022, the company completed its acquisition of Green Dragon and closed on $65 million in its Series E fundraise.Are you an Eaze employee with insight to share? Got a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "The purchase-mortgage firm Tomo is cutting almost a third of its staff and halting expansion plans. The news comes amid a wave of layoffs in the mortgage industry as interest rates have soared. Venture-capital markets have also cooled, with some VCs advising startups to lower costs. Tomo, a startup focused on providing mortgages to people buying homes, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 44 people, or almost a third of its roughly 150 employees. The news comes amid a wave of layoffs at traditional lenders like Wells Fargo and more tech-enabled venture-backed startups like Better as interest rates have risen and volumes have slowed. Last week the drumbeat of job cuts continued at the lending arm of the brokerage Keller Williams, a company that also counts mostly on its purchase-mortgage business.Tomo burst onto the scene last year with a pitch that it would work only with the more stable but more work-intensive purchase-mortgage market instead of the cyclical refinance market, following a $70 million seed infusion that was likely the largest-ever fundraise for a proptech. The company announced a $40 million Series A this year, with investors buying into the view that home purchases would remain strong, CEO Greg Schwartz, a former chief revenue and chief business officer at Zillow, told Insider. Market conditions have since deteriorated \u2014 largely because of a 2-percentage-point increase in the average 30-year mortgage rate this year \u2014 making it clear that even companies tying their success to a firm housing market will face challenges.Tomo on Tuesday said it was making significant staff cuts and rethinking plans to expand into additional real-estate markets.\"The recent shift in the mortgage and venture capital markets due to the rapid increase in interest rates has impacted Tomo's business plans, and led us to make changes to our near-term strategy,\" Schwartz wrote in a statement provided to Insider. \"As part of these measures, we have reduced the size of Tomo's workforce by almost a third. This was a last resort, but ultimately something we felt was necessary to maintain a strong foundation.\" The Mortgage Bankers Association predicted this month that purchase-mortgage originations would increase in 2022 from last year. But those projections have been pared back from the start of this year, suggesting that the shift has surprised even the most seasoned mortgage professionals. Refinancing originations are projected to plunge to well less than half of their 2021 volume.Meanwhile, one of the most voracious buyers of homes has cooled its activity. Redfin's iBuying unit has turned cautious on the US residential market because of growing \"macro uncertainty,\" its chief financial officer, Chris Nielsen, said during the Jefferies Virtual Internet Summit on Tuesday, according to Seeking Alpha.While there is room for purchase mortgages to grow, the softening housing market is being met by a historic pullback in the venture-capital market after a jubilant boom during the pandemic. There are increasing signs that the venture-capital industry is slowing down, leading some investors advising startups to cut back on their commitments."

        "Extracted Article": "B2B finance startup MainStreet has laid off a third of its roughly 150 employees. CEO Doug Ludlow cited \"today's incredibly rough market,\" and warned it may get worse. The company grew quickly after raising a significant Series A, but revenue failed to keep pace. In January 2022, B2B financial-services startup MainStreet flew the entire company out for a week-long working vacation in Maui.&nbsp; About 150 employees stayed at the luxurious Grand Wailea Hotel, attended meetings, and enjoyed free buffets at the beachfront Hawaiian resort. Workers who questioned the expense were told the startup was aiming to land a significant Series B funding round that would ensure significant runway.But the funding that ultimately materialized was smaller than originally planned, Insider has learned, and on Tuesday the company cut around 50 employees \u2014 roughly a third of its workforce. The layoffs highlight the risks of unchecked startup spending as financial markets become increasingly turbulent, and come hot on the heels of similar rounds of employee reductions at Robinhood and Cameo.In an email to staff, MainStreet CEO Doug Ludlow cited difficult market conditions and a push toward profitability. \"We took this action because we believe that there is a very strong chance that today's incredibly rough market is only going to get worse, and potentially remain so for months, if not years,\" he wrote.\"We need to ensure that as a company we are in control of our own destiny, not subject to the whims and waves of the market. This reorg is one of the steps that puts us on a near-term path to profitability and self-sustainability.\" MainStreet was founded in 2019, and grew rapidly on the back of a product that helped startups and other businesses claim tax credits. In March 2021, it raised $60 million in a Series A funding round from investors including SignalFire, Tusk Venture Partners, and Sound Ventures.&nbsp;Headcount and costs quickly ballooned, one source said, but revenue growth failed to keep pace. The company set its sights on securing a similarly lofty Series B \u2014 an effort known internally as \"Baker Street\" \u2014 but Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rising uncertainty in the markets proved troublesome.&nbsp;The company's chief marketing officer Stacey Politi shared a copy of Ludlow's email to staff with Insider, and did not respond to further questions about the business. The VP of engineering, VP of people, VP of sales, and VP of design have all left the company, one source said, with some taking voluntary severance. Rank-and-file layoffs came from across much of the company, including engineering, sales, and marketing.&nbsp;Let-go employees were given two months' salary, healthcare support, and were allowed to keep their laptops.Here's the full email CEO Doug Ludlow sent employees:This week, we took the difficult step of reorganizing and restructuring the company, and in doing so have eliminated ~30% of the roles at @MainStreet. &nbsp;I know from firsthand experience just how painful it is to lose a job due to a reorg - it can be confusing, disorienting, and scary - so I understand just how difficult this week is for our affected team members.We did not take this decision lightly, and we are doing everything within our power to provide as much transition assistance (severance, health care, recruiter and job placement assistance) as is possible.A big part of leadership is looking reality square in the eye, and then making the right call, no matter how difficult it may seem.&nbsp; We took this action because we believe that there is a very strong chance that today's incredibly rough market is only going to get worse, and potentially remain so for months, if not years.&nbsp;We need to ensure that as a company we are in control of our own destiny, not subject to the whims and waves of the market. This reorg is one of the steps that puts us on a near-term path to profitability and self-sustainability.&nbsp;We believe deeply in our mission of helping support founders and small business owners, and we are committed to doing whatever needs to be done to achieve that mission. How can you help? Please DM me, and let me know if you're hiring. I will connect you with our internal recruiting team who is working to help place former MainStreet Team Members with new roles.Thanks,&nbsp;Doug"

        "Extracted Article": "Food52, a crowdsourced recipe and home goods bizarre, was founded in 2009. It laid off around 20 staffers Wednesday in an apparent shift towards e-commerce. Employees Insider spoke with said they were shocked because they had just been given raises. On Wednesday morning, about 20 of the roughly 200 employees at Food52, the popular venture-backed recipe and home-goods bazaar, received an unusual calendar invitation to have an individual \"check-in\" over Google Meet with a company executive. Those employees, who were part of Food52's content team, were told by SVP of content Stacey Rivera that they were being laid off, effective immediately. Within minutes, their Slack and email accounts were suddenly shut off, according to two employees who requested anonymity to speak about the layoffs.&nbsp;\"Everyone on the team and my immediate boss were gut-punched,\" one of these employees told Insider. \"We all had gotten raises and bonuses just a month prior.\" \"We just had new funding, we just acquired another company, and leadership only said everything was going very well,\" another employee added, referring to the $80 million investment the company secured from TCG in December and its recent $48 million acquisition of decor and furnishings company Schoolhouse.TCG, which is the investment arm of The Chernin Group, previously bought&nbsp;an $83 million majority stake in the company in 2019. The latest funding round valued the company at $300 million, according to Pitchbook. Food52 has more than 200 employees, according to LinkedIn.For the previous decade, Food52 had operated independently as a website offering easy-to-make recipes for everything from egg sandwiches to acorn squash soup, along with selling home goods like ice cube trays and bakeware. Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, two veteran food journalists who worked for The New York Times, cofounded Food52 in 2009. &nbsp; Rivera, as well as Kelsey Burrow, a spokeswoman for Food52, declined to comment but referred to the company's in a Digiday story confirming 20 staffers had been laid off where she said the reductions are a move to \"better support our commerce business and to better integrate the two companies we acquired last year.\"&nbsp;Mike Kerns, a partner at TCG who led the Food52 investment, did not respond to a request for comment.The layoffs signal a shift towards Food52's more lucrative home goods marketplace and away from costlier original content like recipes and cooking tips. At least two of the terminated employees were told by executives the company was \"pivoting to commerce.\" One was told \"content is getting too expensive.\"&nbsp; \"I guess that they're limiting resources for quality content and instead focusing on selling stuff,\" one employee said, adding that the editing and social media teams were particularly hard hit.\u2014Margaret Eby (@margareteby) April 7, 2022 &nbsp;In 2020, Food52 doubled its revenue from the previous year and achieved profitability for the first time, according to Fast Company, which reported the company is now planning to open pop-up shops and brick-and-mortar stores.\"Food52 capitalized on the understanding that if you create a body of communal knowledge that you share, readers are more likely to buy other products from you,\" food historian KC Hysmith told the magazine. The company has already increased its e-commerce focus. In addition to its $48 million deal for Schoolhouse in December, Food52 acquired the cookware brand Dansk last year for an undisclosed amount.Got a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "Gopuff has let go about 100 employees on its warehouse and operations team, three people said. The company&nbsp;has also paused several plans to open more warehouses in the US, two of the people said. Gopuff may be controlling costs ahead of a possible IPO later this year. Gopuff has cut about 100 jobs across the company's operations and warehouse teams, three people familiar with the matter said. The company has also paused several plans to open more warehouses across the US, two of the people said. The moves may help the ultrafast-delivery startup control costs and prepare for a possible IPO later this year.Gopuff mostly eliminated the district-manager position across the company. Many of these managers were let go with little notice, told by their superiors to leave work that day, and await details about severance, the people said. Other managers were offered different roles within the company, they added, while asking to not be identified while discussing sensitive topics.&nbsp; District managers at Gopuff oversee multiple warehouses and serve as a layer between the managers who run individual warehouses and regional managers who oversee larger swaths of territory, such as the South or parts of New England.&nbsp;Other parts of the company's warehouse operations also cut jobs, including teams that trained managers and warehouse workers, teams that set up new warehouse operations, and human-resources groups.&nbsp;Gopuff says it currently employs about 10,000 people and is continuing to hire. The company added that it continually reevalutes its warehouse locations to maximize for demand. Gopuff added more warehouse square footage in 2021 than the previous 36 months combined, according to the company. The moves reorient the company's warehouse operations away from a management-heavy retail model toward one that's perhaps closer to a tech-driven Amazon approach. Gopuff has hired heavily from Amazon in the past year. Tim Collins, its VP of operations, spent more than 15 years at the tech giant. The company's founders have long admired Amazon and internally discussed their ambitions to build a company at that scale.Gopuff had been aggressively expanding over the past few years, opening hundreds of distribution and delivery warehouses across the country. It also acquired traditional retailers, such as BevMo and Liquor Barn.Warehouses managers previously described the operations as chaotic, with an oversupply of goods piling up outside facilities and not enough staff. It's unclear whether the recent changes will improve the situation at the warehouses or make them worse. Warehouse managers frequently complained that they weren't getting enough support from Gopuff's facilities teams or upper management.&nbsp; Still, cutting costs may be higher on the agenda for the company, which was valued at $15 billion last year. One of the questions lingering over Gopuff's possible IPO this year is how receptive the markets will be to a money-losing company. Last year, Gopuff lost around $500 million, before interest, taxes, and other costs, Axios reported.Are you an insider with insight to share? Got a tip?
