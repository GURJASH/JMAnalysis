        "Extracted Article": "Commercetools a “headless commerce platform that provides APIs to companies building online storefronts saw a major boost in its business just a few years ago, raising money at a whopping $1.9 billion valuation as the world went shopping online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and businesses rushed to improve their e-commerce operations. Today, the playbook looks a little different for e-commerce, and for Commercetools.&nbsp; TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Commercetools has laid off dozens of employees over the last few weeks, including around 10% of staff earlier Wednesday, after failing to meet its sales growth targets. It’s also making a number of executive changes, including parting ways with its chief revenue officer and CFO, and reassigning the roles previously held by its chief information security and compliance officer.&nbsp; “While we’ve made meaningful progress and our business continues to grow, over the last several quarters we haven’t fully achieved our aggressive revenue growth targets,” CEO Andrew Burton said in a memo to the company, which TechCrunch has viewed. “That reality has required me, our executive team, and our Board to take a hard, in-depth look at where we fell short, where we showed strength, and what needs to change to build a stronger future.” Significant restructuring will be carried out in marketing, sales, and internal operations such as HR and finance, according to the memo. Select staff in customer and product development will also be cut “after reviewing performance and impact. The full memo, shared by a source and confirmed as authentic by the company, is published below.&nbsp; Burton, speaking to TechCrunch after we contacted the company about the memo, said that around 10% of the companys employees were affected today, but declined to give an exact number. A source, who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, said Wednesdays layoffs total more than 70 people and, including selective reductions he claimed happened over a period of several weeks, make up to 20% of staff. The company disputes that there have been any layoffs beyond those announced Wednesday. Burton also added the company has 25-30 open roles its looking to fill. It’s a difficult bump in the road for a company that appears to have had a strong run in the market. Originally founded in 2006 in Munich, Germany, Commercetools raised just $30 million in outside funding before it was acquired by retail giant REWE in 2015. By 2019, it was seeing its revenues growing at 110% annually. REWE spun it out as a startup again, backed with $145 million in funding from Insight Partners at a $300 million valuation. After COVID-19 hit, Commercetools’ business boomed as shopping of all kinds went digital. Less than three years after that Insight round, it was able to raise $140 million at a $1.9 billion valuation led by Accel. Through all of this, Commercetools’ founder Dirk Hoerig led the company as CEO. He stepped away from the top position in July 2024, to be replaced by Burton. (Hoerig has retained a seat on the board and is the company’s chief innovation officer.)&nbsp; At the time, the company was making “far beyond” $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and Burton’s arrival was seen as a precursor to the company going public, reportedly in 2025 or 2026. Burton declined to comment today on an IPO or other future plans. The memo cites, at a high level, that Commercetools was missing its growth targets. There have been other more specific shifts in the market. While Commercetools was a very early mover in the space of “headless commerce” — a term first coined by Hoerig — a number of competitors have emerged in more recent years. Chief among them is Shopify, which originally pitched itself to smaller merchants and has gradually grown into working with the same larger retailers that Commercetools targets.&nbsp; At the same time, e-commerce has continued to grow, but not at the breakneck pace seen between 2020 and 2022. The most recent U.S. Census Bureau figures noted that U.S. retail e-commerce grew just 2.7% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2024, totaling $308.9 billion and accounting for 16.4% of all retail sales. Earlier today, eBay noted that its Q4 sales grew just 1%. Burton also cited question marks over how tariffs would play out as another factor impacting e-commerce companies, and the knock-on effect that has on suppliers like Commercetools. We had really ambitious goals that we had not reset to reflect the macro-economic uncertainty, Burton told TechCrunch Wednesday. Finally, while brand-owned storefronts — a mainstay business for companies like Commercetools — continue to make up a giant part of the e-commerce market, theyre also competing against a new wave of marketplaces. Temu, Instagram, and TikTok all represent a new kind of social commerce that once again could change the game. Other headless companies be they focused on e-commerce or content management or something else that have seen growth with the growth of the internet now have to respond to changing tides, be it a new method of content consumption or buying goods, or AI. The ball’s in the court for companies like Commercetools to anticipate and build for wherever and however people may want to shop in the future. Memo below: Subject:&nbsp;Important Update Hi team, Over the past few years, we set ambitious goals, anticipating strong market growth. While we’ve made meaningful progress and our business continues to grow, over the last several quarters we haven’t fully achieved our aggressive revenue growth targets. That reality has required me, our executive team, and our Board to take a hard, in-depth look at where we fell short, where we showed strength, and what needs to change to build a stronger future. As part of this, we made the difficult decision to restructure a few teams, implement targeted reductions in specific areas, and eliminate some roles. This decision is not a reflection on individual commercetoolers, their talent, dedication, or impact, but instead a necessary step to sharpen our focus and re-position&nbsp;commercetools&nbsp;to be in a stronger position to navigate and succeed in this turbulent market. Many of you have built strong relationships with the colleagues who are leaving today. They have shaped&nbsp;commercetools&nbsp;in ways big and small, and we are truly grateful. We are providing all impacted employees with severance and continued benefits above the market standard. Additionally, we are continuing their access to OpenUp, our online platform offering diverse mental health support resources, to support them in this transition. I know this is hard news to process. Change brings uncertainty, and we are committed to providing as much clarity, support, and direction as possible. To help answer common questions, we’ve put together an Employee FAQ that outlines key details about the restructuring, resources available, and what’s next. To give everyone space to reflect, we are giving all employees this Friday, February 28th as a day off. Your executive leader will meet with your department later today or tomorrow to discuss what this means for you and your team. What’s Changing C-level Updates: Bruno Teuber (CRO)&nbsp;– Transitioning out of the executive team, staying as an advisor until the end of H1. A new CRO search has started; in the interim, sales will report to me. Dan Murphy (CFO)&nbsp;– Transitioning out of the executive team, advising until the end of H1. CFO role&nbsp;will not be backfilled; Finance, Digital Solutions, and Legal will report to Matt Tuel (COO). Denis Werner (Chief Information Security &amp; Compliance Officer)&nbsp;– Moving to a compliance-focused role under Dirk Hörig. IT Ops moving to Digital Solutions under Matt Tuel, Information Security moving to Product under Hajo Eichler, and Office Management moving to People under Roxana Dobrescu. Teams with Significant Restructuring: Marketing (including BDRs)&nbsp;– Realignment to focus on enterprise GTM model and sales PODs. Sales &amp; Operations&nbsp;– Restructuring to improve sales support and focus on top markets/customers. Enablement Functions (Finance, People, etc.)&nbsp;– Consolidating teams for better operational efficiency. Other Impacted Areas&nbsp;– Select cuts in&nbsp;Customer and Product Development&nbsp;after reviewing performance and impact. Change is never easy, but it’s at the core of what we do — helping businesses adapt to new realities. Now, we’re doing the same. In our&nbsp;Company All Hands tomorrow, we will walk through these changes in more detail — the why, what, and how we move forward together — staying true to our belief in adapting boldly to build what’s next.

The layoffs, first reported by The Register, come less than two weeks after Sophos completed its $859 million acquisition of U.S. cybersecurity company Secureworks. In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Sophos spokesperson Sara Eberle said the layoffs will affect “roughly 6% of our combined companies.” Sophos declined to confirm the exact number of employees that had been affected and would not disclose the company’s current headcount. Sophos said the workforce reduction is due to “positions that are no longer needed when Secureworks delisted as a public company and streamlining duplicative roles as a result of the acquisition.” In 2023, Sophos laid off 10% of its workforce — approximately 450 employees — which the company said at the time was to achieve “the optimal balance of growth and profitability.",

The Amsterdam-based firm formerly known as MessageBird plans to realign its global operations amid the ongoing AI boom, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Bird has since confirmed the news. The Dutch startup contacted impacted employees on Friday. The move comes just a year after Bird cut 90 employees following its rebrand. The company also slashed prices at the time in an effort to take on the likes of Twilio, Klaviyo, and Attentive. The startup offers a CRM (customer relationship management) platform for marketing, sales, and payments via email, SMS, and WhatsApp. Bird founder and CEO Robert Vis confirmed the number of employees impacted, adding that most of the roles were in Europe. While Bird was founded in Amsterdam and built strong European roots, our customer footprint has grown significantly in the Americas and Asia. This realignment will position our teams closer to our customers, enabling us to better serve them in their local time zones and cultural contexts, Vis said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The startup counts Meta, PayPal, Square, and Uber as its key customers. It offers a unified solution to let businesses communicate with their customers via different channels, including email, SMS, voice, and WhatsApp. Vis asserted the layoffs were not a cost-reduction exercise as the startups financials remain strong. Instead, AI adoption has contributed to the reduction of roles. The list of similarly impacted companies includes Sprinklr, Workday, and Okta. The changes will help us return to the agile, focused model that drove our early success — starting with SMS and expanding to become one of the worlds largest providers of business communications solutions, Vis said. The executive stated that the affected employees would receive comprehensive transition support without sharing specifics on the severance. In 2021, Bird raised $800 million in a Series C extension featuring Tiger Global, Eurazeo, and Owl Rock. That followed a $240 million round that valued the startup at $3 billion. The startup acquired email marketing platform SparkPost in 2021 for $600 million.",

The new layoffs come less than a year after the company cut about 3% of its workforce in May and after it earlier reduced its headcount by 4% in 2023. The two earlier layoffs impacted roughly 200 employees altogether. The New York-headquartered company, which counts Microsoft, P&amp;G, and Samsung among over 1,800 global customers, started notifying affected employees about the cuts this week, TechCrunch learned and confirmed with the company. We will refocus and rebalance our investments, talent, and resources in order to better serve our customers and partners and help them realize the full value of our AI-powered platform, a Sprinklr spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the move does not impact C-level positions. The company will continue to hire in prioritized areas to focus on its strategic priorities, the spokesperson said. Last week, Sprinklr appointed former PwC partner Jan Hauser and former Lenovo CEO and C3.ai founding member Stephen Ward as new board directors amid its shifting focus toward developing AI-led experiences. In a related announcement, Sprinklr said that current board member and audit committee chair, Ed Gillis, who has served since November 2015, is stepping down from his position at the end of March. Per its most recent annual report released in March of last year, Sprinklr had 3,869 employees, including 2,276 in India and 787 in the U.S. We will support departing teammates with the greatest care and respect, acknowledging their contributions to Sprinklr, and assisting them in their transition, the spokesperson said.

        "Extracted Article": "Autonomous vehicle company Cruise is laying off nearly 50% of its workforce — cuts that extend to the CEO and several other top executives — as it prepares to shut down operations. What remains of Cruise will move under parent company General Motors as the automaker directs its resources toward improving its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise — and eventually rolls out personal autonomous vehicles. The layoffs were announced by Craig Glidden, Cruise’s president and chief administrative officer, according to a companywide email that TechCrunch has viewed and verified with sources.&nbsp;Individuals who were affected received a separate email from Cruise Chief Human Resources Officer Nilka Thomas. CEO Marc Whitten will depart from Cruise this week, along with Thomas, Chief Safety Officer Steve Kenner, and Global Head of Public Policy Rob Grant. Mo Elshenawy, Cruises chief technologist, will stay on through the end of April to help with the transition. As a result of the change in strategy we announced in December, today we will part with nearly 50% of our Cruise employee base, through a reduction in force, the email from Glidden reads. Anyone who has been through a reduction knows that days like this are extremely difficult, and today is no different. With our move away from the ride-hail business and toward providing autonomous vehicles to customers alongside GM, our staffing and resource needs have dramatically changed. Todays actions align our teams to our new needs, and focus our efforts on continuing to build world-class AV technology. As of January 2024, Cruise employed about 2,100 people, according to sources who based the estimates on the number of members on a Slack channel for company announcements. That means more than 1,000 employees might have been impacted by the layoffs. Cruise shared the difficult decision to part ways with approximately 50% of its workforce, the company wrote in an emailed statement. We are grateful for their passion and contributions to help us reach this stage, and our focus is on supporting them into their next chapter with severance packages and career support. While not an easy decision, we are focused on combining efforts with General Motors to accelerate autonomy at scale on personal autonomous vehicles. GM sent out a press release (after the layoffs were announced internally) that it has completed its acquisition of GM Cruise Holdings LLC following the approval of GM’s merger offer by the Cruise board of directors. Cruise is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM. All employees who were laid off will remain on the companys payroll through April 5 and receive benefits through the end of April. Affected workers will receive eight weeks of severance pay and benefits. Long-term employees will be offered another two weeks of pay and benefits for every full year of employment over three years. All employees will also receive three months of company-paid COBRA coverage, as well as a Linkedin Premium subscription for a year to support their job search. The layoffs come nearly two months after GM said it would no longer fund the development of a commercial robotaxi business and would instead focus on building personal autonomous vehicle technology.&nbsp; The automaker expects to save up to $1 billion annually by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program, according to details shared during the companys fourth-quarter earnings call. At the time, CFO Paul Jacobson said the projected cost savings were based on the assumption that “Cruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year.” In mid-January, Cruise management started to extend retention offers to employees, almost all of whom were engineers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email to Cruise employees, CEO Marc Whitten indicated that next steps would come after the Cruise board met. That meeting happened on Monday, according to one source.&nbsp; While Cruise employees were initially blindsided by GM’s decision to pull the plug on the robotaxi development program, they have been expecting such an announcement for weeks. Sources who spoke to TechCrunch said they have been hardly working and in a state of limbo since GM’s announcement as they awaited next steps. On Monday afternoon, Glidden sent a Slack message to employees saying that he expects to share “some news regarding the transition plans tomorrow” and advised staffers to “plan on working from home.”&nbsp; “Thank you for your patience during this time we know the uncertainty has been difficult but you have navigated the past weeks with grace and professionalism,” Glidden wrote.&nbsp; Glidden had previously served as GM’s executive vice president of legal and policy, but the automaker assigned him his role at Cruise in November 2023, following a Cruise safety incident that led to the company’s downfall.&nbsp; On October 2, 2023, a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian, who was stuck under the car, some 20 feet as it attempted a pullover maneuver.&nbsp; Cruise officials did not immediately share that relevant bit of information with authorities, and when it was revealed, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission immediately suspended the company’s permits to operate. Cruise then grounded its entire robotaxi fleet across the U.S., and much of its leadership team stepped down, including co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt.&nbsp; After installing new leadership, including a permanent chief safety officer, Cruise was gearing up for a relaunch at the start of this year in Austin. The company had spent much of 2024 testing in Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and the Bay Area and beefing out its safety systems. Two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch the company had been ready to implement a retrofitted sensor solution internally referred to as Project Rhino that would have solved for the October 2 incident by creating additional visibility and awareness underneath the car. In June 2024, GM injected another $850 million into Cruise, bringing its total spend on the company since acquiring most of Cruise’s shares in 2016 close to $10 billion. In September, Elshenawy, president and chief technologist of Cruise, threw a huge party for Cruise staffers that some read to be a sign that the company was moving forward.&nbsp; An earlier version included a statement from Cruise that put the layoff count at 40%. Cruise later corrected their statement to reflect Gliddens email, which said nearly 50% of workers would be laid off.",

On Thursday, founder and CEO Paul Kesserwani posted on LinkedIn about the decision to wind down the company at the end of 2024. In the post, Kesserwani said that “despite bringing multiple new fintech products to market,” Cushion “didn’t reach the scale needed to sustain the business.” Founded in late 2016, San Francisco-based Cushion had raised a total of $21.6 million from investors such as Afore Capital, Flourish Ventures, Vestigo Ventures, Better Tomorrow Ventures, and 500 Global.&nbsp; Its last publicly announced raise was in May, 2022 when it closed a $12 million Series A. Its post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook. Kesserwani did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Cushion offered a consumer app that sucked in the transaction history from its users’ bank accounts, determined what fees had been assessed and then conducted negotiations on their behalf to get a refund. It was designed, Kesserwani told TechCrunch in 2019, to be incentive-aligned with consumers by only taking a commission on any returned cash. Kesserwani got the idea for Cushion after leaving his job at Twitter. While taking some time off to think about what he wanted to do next, he was helping his parents manage their bank accounts while they were traveling for work in Lebanon. Due to bank security policies, his parents weren’t able to log into their accounts from Lebanon, and eventually, they faced a mountain of banking fees as their accounts went unattended. As Kesserwani investigated, he turned to his own accounts, and realized he had also been paying fees to the tune of $400 that he had no memory of agreeing to. In Thursday’s LinkedIn post, Kesserwani said that Cushion had automated bank fee negotiation and reached $3 million ARR in 10 months and processed over $300 million in BNPL loans. He added that the company had onboarded over 1 million consumers over time, with more than 200,000 paying customers. Wrote Kesserwani: “I gave Cushion everything I had for 8+ years. While the outcome wasn’t what we hoped for, we built something that moved the industry forward — and I’m proud of that. As for me, Im excited for whats next.” Data suggests that 2025 is expected to be another brutal year for startup shutdowns. In late December, another fintech Bench shut down abruptly only to be acquired days later. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech&nbsp;here.

        "Extracted Article": "French food delivery startup Epicery will cease operations Tuesday, after one last holiday season hurrah for its clients and the local food businesses that were using the platform during its nine years in business in exchange for a 25% commission. In a message announcing the decision to customers earlier this month, Epicery’s team said that it was “the result of the economic and financial challenges we have been facing for several months, and which, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to overcome.” With a focus on premium groceries and local deliveries, Epicery suffered when inflation made customers rethink their food spending. Even after ceasing operations in some cities, it had a negative EBITDA of -€4.69 million in 2023, on sales of €2.57 million. Before these difficulties, however, the startup reached unexpected highs when France went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was still riding that wave in late 2021 when Geopost/DPDgroup, the express parcel delivery branch of Groupe La Poste, which handles France’s national postal service, took a majority shareholding in the company. The corporate alliance made sense at the time: Geopost was also an investor in last-mile delivery service Stuart, of which Epicery was a heavy user. But in recent months, La Poste cut ties with several startups it previously invested in, and in particular, sold Stuart at a significant loss. In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Geopost stated that the decision was made “following an in-depth analysis of [Epicery’s] financial and operating performance” leading to the conclusion that “the subsidiarys short- and medium-term profitability has been severely impacted by developments in the food delivery market, a gradual post-COVID return to direct consumption from local shops, and strong competition in the catering segment.” Food delivery in France in 2024 looked vastly different compared to Epicery’s first years (it launched in 2016). At the time, its competitors included Take Eat Easy, which ceased operations in 2016, but Deliveroo and Uber Eats were nowhere in sight, and quick commerce hadn’t gone through its rise and fall. While Cajoo, Flink, Gopuff, and Gorillas no longer operate in France, their marketing presence was hard to escape for quite a while. In comparison, Epicery’s scale and visibility were always modest. It had some 25,000 recurring customers, buying from some 1,100 local shops, mostly in Paris and Lyon after it scaled back on its national expansion. This could have made sense as a standalone, lifestyle business, but arguably less so as a VC-backed one, and even less so as part of a large group where numbers like these hardly move the needle, especially with the Stuart synergies gone. Epicery co-founder and CEO Édouard Morhange wasn’t able to comment on strategic aspects due to a non-disclosure agreement. In a personal statement, however, he commented on Epicery’s legacy. “Im very proud to have introduced local retailers to ecommerce over the past 10 years, and Im confident that theyll continue to develop their digital sales over the coming years.” Morhange will remain active in the food sector, saying he’s currently working on “an ambitious new model that will enable the food industry to pursue its digitalization in France and abroad.” As for Epicery’s employees, Geopost said that each of them will receive “support from the HR teams to discuss opportunities within the Group or to help them find a job.” French entrepreneur Nicolas Machard, whose food marketplace Pourdebon is also a subsidiary of Geopost, said he’s confident that Epicery’s employees will soon land new roles. He’s also confident that Geopost and Pourdebon are still a great fit, mission-wise and economically. Not only is Pourdebon a heavy user of Geopost’s food delivery service Chronofresh, but it is also on track to reach profitability in 2027, and will likely work on reaching that milestone earlier. Epicery didn’t manage to make the math work on the profitability front, but it sometimes brought up to 10% or even 20% in sales to local shops it worked with. According to Elsa Hermal, who co-founded Epicery with Morhange and VC Marc Menasé before leaving operations in 2019, this was a very important milestone. “Whats wonderful, and whats very important to me, is that what we promised [shop owners] at the very beginning, and what took us a long time to achieve, has now become an important part of their business,” said Hermal, who’s now a business coach and impact investor through climate fund Satgana. As an investor, Hermal knows that Epicery was operating in a complex niche, but doesnt think its a no-go. Logistics businesses are complicated and challenging in terms of metrics, but that doesnt mean it cant be done. Now that local businesses have had a taste of this, and in a context where every sale counts, it wouldnt be too surprising to see an Epicery-like model make a comeback at some point.",

        "Extracted Article": "Bench, a Canada-based accounting startup that offered software-as-a-service for small and medium-sized businesses, has abruptly shut down, according to a notice posted on its website.&nbsp;&nbsp; “We regret to inform you that as of December 27, 2024, the Bench platform will no longer be accessible,” the notice reads. “We know this news is abrupt and may cause disruption, so we’re committed to helping Bench customers navigate through the transition.” The company’s entire website is currently offline except for the notice, leaving thousands of businesses in the lurch. Bench touted having more than 35,000 U.S. customers just hours before it was shut down, according to a snapshot saved by the Internet Archive. Bench, which had raised $113 million from high-profile backers such as Shopify and Bain Capital Ventures, developed a software platform to help customers store and manage their bookkeeping and tax reporting documents. The move is a shock to current and former customers. Justin Metros, the co-founder and CTO of Radiator, said years of his companys accounting and tax documents are still stored on the site, although he no longer uses the platform. He learned about the shutdown from TechCrunch.&nbsp; “I’ve never seen anyone just shut down like that,” Metros said. “That’s crazy.”&nbsp; Others are airing their concerns on social media, with one posting, “as a customer, I’m pissed,” having just migrated from QuickBooks to Bench. Bench’s notice says its customers should file a six-month extension with the IRS to “find the right bookkeeping partner.” It also says customers will be able to download their data by December 30 and will have until March 2025 to do so. The notice recommends customers migrate to Kick, a new accounting startup that announced its $9 million seed raise in October 2024 in a round led by OpenAI and General Catalyst. Kick’s CEO and founder, Conrad Wadowski, posted a message on LinkedIn to former Bench users about how Kick is “working to get your financials back in your hands.” Bench did not respond to requests for comment by TechCrunch as of press time.&nbsp;Wadowski did not respond directly to a question from TechCrunch about details of any possible agreement or other business relationship it had with Bench prior to the shutdown.&nbsp; “As you saw on the website, were moving fast and are available to support many of Benchs customers with their bookkeeping needs,” he told TechCrunch. Founded in 2012, Bench employed more than 600 staff, according to a snapshot of its About page. The startup was backed by investors, including IT firm Sage, Contour Venture Partners, and Altos Ventures. It was also a member of the TechStars accelerator. Bench last raised $60 million in a Series C round in 2021. Its co-founder and CEO, Ian Crosby, departed shortly after.&nbsp; Crosby posted on LinkedIn today that he was “very sad” to see Bench shut down, alleging he had been replaced by unnamed board members who wanted to bring in “a new professional CEO” to take Bench in a different direction. “I hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs that think they can upgrade a company by replacing the founder. It never works,” Crosby wrote.",

Update: Lilium might be saved after all. The company said in a Dec. 24 announcement that a consortium of investors has agreed to acquire two Lilium subsidiaries, which would allow it to restructure and exit insolvency. The publication Gründerszene was the first to report the layoffs. Lilium co-founder Patrick Nathen confirmed on LinkedIn that the 10-year-old company had stopped operating. After 10 years and 10 months, it is a sad fact that Lilium has ceased operations. The company that Daniel, Sebastian, Matthias and I founded can no longer pursue our shared belief in more environmentally friendly aviation. This is heartbreaking and the timing feels painfully ironic, wrote Nathen. The layoffs cover the bulk of the companys workforce and come a few days after about 200 workers were let go, according to a regulatory filing on December 16. A spokesperson from Lilium responded to an email seeking comment, but didnt provide any information. The company will communicate once we can say something, the email read. Lilium, which was developing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft with speeds of up to 100 km/h, has struggled for months. The startups vision for electric aircraft attracted backers like Tencent and locked in customers, including an order for 100 electric jets from Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company went public on the Nasdaq Exchange via a reverse merger with a blank-check company, SPAC Qell. And while the company had made some progress, including powering up its first full-scale prototype, it was still years away from delivering its product. In October, Lilium said it would file for insolvency — the U.S. equivalent of bankruptcy — after failing to raise emergency money from the German government. Under insolvency, Lilium lost control of its subsidiaries, which includes Lilium eAircraft. KPMG was handling the sale process.",

        "Extracted Article": "Yahoo laid off around 25% of its cybersecurity team — known as The Paranoids — over the last year, TechCrunch has learned. Overall, the company has laid off or lost through attrition 40 to 50 people from a total of 200 employees in the cybersecurity team since the start of 2024, according to multiple current and former Yahoo employees who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity. (Yahoo is TechCrunchs parent company.) The Paranoids are not the only team affected by the layoffs. Valeri Liborski, who was appointed Yahoos chief technology officer in September, sent an email this week to employees announcing changes across the broader technology unit, including enterprise productivity and core services. The email to staff, which was obtained by TechCrunch, said: This was a very difficult decision and one I have not taken lightly.” The Paranoids’ red team, or offensive security team — which conducts cyberattack simulations to identify weaknesses in the companys network before external hackers can — was eliminated entirely this week, and there have been at least three rounds of layoffs impacting the cybersecurity team this year, according to the sources. Yahoo confirmed the layoffs, including the elimination of its red team, when reached by TechCrunch on Thursday. Yahoo’s security program has matured significantly over the past seven years and is widely recognized as a world-class, industry-leading operation. As part of this evolution, we’ve made strategic adjustments, including transitioning offensive security operations to an outsourced model, said Yahoo spokesperson Brenden Lee. This change reflects the sophistication of our program and enables us to concentrate resources on critical security priorities, maintaining the highest standards of protection for our users and platforms.&nbsp; The company as a whole laid off more than 1,600 employees — around 20% of its total workforce — last year, as Axios reported at the time. Yahoo chief executive Jim Lanzone told Axios that the layoffs would be tremendously beneficial for the profitability of Yahoo overall and that the company will “go on offense” and invest in other parts of its business.",

        "Extracted Article": "Monarch Tractor has laid off around 10% of its workforce as part of a restructuring that will see it prioritize non-agricultural customers, license its autonomous technology, and boost sales of its AI-powered farm management software, TechCrunch has learned. Around 35 employees were cut this week by the Livermore, California-based autonomous electric tractor startup that has raised a total of $220 million since it was founded in 2018. Some Monarch workers told TechCrunch they were let go without severance. Its the second cut this year; Monarch previously laid off around 15% of its workforce in July. CEO Praveen Penmetsa told TechCrunch in an interview the company decided to restructure after a slower-than-expected third quarter, and despite raising $133 million in July from the likes of Foxconn and agri-food tech impact firm Astanor. Penmetsa said he was uncertain if employees were let go without severance, but that the company has been trying to help out laid-off workers on a case-by-case basis. All of this happened pretty quickly, Penmetsa said, referring to the recent crash of Californias vineyards, which made up a bulk of Monarchs early customers. That development, plus an ongoing pullback in agri-tech investing, left Penmetsa and his team looking at other options. The industry has slowed down on acquisition of new equipment and new solutions, especially in the core farming sectors, Penmetsa said. But in the meantime, as a platform company, we also have some very exciting non-agriculture opportunities that started sprouting because of our success in ag. He said the company, which has shipped 500 tractors to date, is now focused on widening its customer base in a number of ways. It is expanding beyond agricultural customers to golf courses, solar farms, and even municipalities. Its also putting more focus on selling its WingspanAI farm management software. And Monarch is in talks with other off-road vehicle companies to license its autonomous technology. Penmetsa said these changes inspired the cuts which hit, among other things, some of Monarchs engineering and operations team. He also said that Monarch is leaning more on contract-manufacturer Foxconn, which builds the tractors at its Lordstown, Ohio facility, for operational roles. We are a startup, Penmetsa said. You have to be agile, right?",

In an update posted to its website, Exosonic said it was unable to find the traction necessary to continue operations.&nbsp; “Although the founders and team still believe in the need/desire for quiet supersonic flight and supersonic drones for the US Department of Defense, without further customer support for either concept, the company cannot sustain the cash needs to make further advancements,” the update says.&nbsp; Exosonic was founded in 2019 by Norris Tie, a propulsion engineer who cut his teeth at primes like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin; at the latter company, he reportedly worked on the low-boom X-59 aircraft for NASA. Exosonic joined Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 cohort and went on to raise over $4.5 million from venture investors, including Soma Capital, Psion Capital, and Stellar Solutions. The startup also bagged several small grants from the U.S. Air Force under its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.&nbsp; The company was making progress: It hit a major milestone earlier this year when it flew its first aircraft, a subscale variant of its supersonic UAV called EX-3M Trident, in a test flight in California. It also had two other vehicles under development: a supersonic airliner called Horizon and a larger UAV called Revenant. When asked about what Exosonic accomplishment he was most proud of, Tie said, Im frankly just proud of taking a childhood dream and building a company around it. Ive been able to learn so much and meet great people along the way. From a company accomplishment standpoint, definitely flying our EX-3M Trident is the one the team is most proud of. We took an original supersonic aircraft design and flew it (albeit subscale and subsonic), but we did that in roughly &lt;2 years with limited capital. It sounds like the company was ultimately unable to bridge what’s often referred to in defense tech as “the valley of death” — the period between R&amp;D and commercialization. This is a well-known problem for vendors looking to sell to the Department of Defense, and a place where venture capitalists have said they could step in — unless they don’t. As Exosonic put it on LinkedIn, “Without further government support for its near-term supersonic UAV development, Exosonic can no longer sustain the capital required to further advance the concept.”&nbsp; Tie confirmed that the company has received some interest for potential IP purchases. The story has been updated with Ties comment.",

        "Extracted Article": "The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Firefox browser maker Mozilla, has laid off 30% of its employees as the organization says it faces a relentless onslaught of change. When reached by TechCrunch, Mozilla Foundations communications chief Brandon Borrman confirmed the layoffs in an email. The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward, read the statement shared with TechCrunch. According to its annual tax filings, the Mozilla Foundation reported having 60 employees during the 2022 tax year. The number of employees at the time of the layoffs was closer to 120 people, according to a person with knowledge. When asked by TechCrunch, Mozillas spokesperson did not dispute the figure. This is the second layoff at Mozilla this year, the first affecting dozens of employees who work on the side of the organization that builds the popular Firefox browser. Mozilla is made up of several organizations, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Foundation, which oversees Mozillas corporate governance structure and sets the browser makers policies. Much of Mozillas work focused on advocating for privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies, and to create safer, more transparent online experiences for everyone, which ultimately benefit the browser maker and its users. Announcing the layoffs in an email to all employees on October 30, the Mozilla Foundations executive director Nabiha Syed confirmed that two of the foundations major divisions — advocacy and global programs — are no longer a part of our structure. After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundations work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas, without providing specifics. The move, according to Syed, is in part to produce a unified, powerful narrative from the Foundation, including revamping the foundations strategic communications. Our mission at Mozilla is more high-stakes than ever, wrote Syed in an email to staff, a copy of which was shared with TechCrunch. We find ourselves in a relentless onslaught of change in the technology (and broader) world, and the idea of putting people before profit feels increasingly radical.&nbsp; Navigating this topsy-turvy, distracting time requires laser focus — and sometimes saying goodbye to the excellent work that has gotten us this far because it wont get us to the next peak. Lofty goals demand hard choices, wrote Syed. Syed, who joined the Mozilla Foundation in February, previously served as chief executive at data journalism and investigative news site The Markup.

        "Extracted Article": "Dropbox is laying off 20% of its workforce as the cloud company undergoes what CEO Drew Houston calls a transitional period. In a letter to staff, Houston said that the reduction in headcount would impact 528 people. The goal, he added, was to make cuts in areas where Dropbox has over-invested while designing a flatter, more efficient team structure. As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I’m truly sorry to those impacted by this change, he wrote. This market is moving fast and investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into this space. This both validates the opportunity weve been pursuing and underscores the need for even more urgency, even more aggressive investment, and decisive action. According to a filing with the SEC, Dropbox estimates itll lay out total cash expenditures of $63 million to $68 million on the layoffs, primarily in the form of severance and benefits, and recognize $47 million to $52 million of incremental expense. Most of the payouts will occur in Q4 2024, with the remainder to be recognized in H1 2025. Affected employees will receive severance, equity, and transition payments, as well as certain healthcare benefits and job placement services. Dropbox has struggled to grow in recent months, losing market share to rivals, including Box and Google Drive. In its most recent fiscal quarter, the company added only 63,000 new users — a fraction of its roughly 18 million user base — while revenue growth slid to the low single digits. In Q2, Dropbox saw the lowest quarter for growth in its history: 1.9% year-over-year growth to $634.5 million. As of August, the companys shares had lost more than 20% of their value year to date. We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business, Houston wrote. While Im proud of the progress we’ve made in the last couple years, in some parts of the business, we’re still not delivering at the level our customers deserve or performing in line with industry peers. The layoffs come a year after Dropbox let go of roughly 500 employees — and as the company increasingly invests in AI technologies. Dropbox recently expanded its AI-powered smart organization and search tool, Dropbox Dash, with enterprise-focused features, including data governance controls. In his letter, Houston said that Dropbox plans to share more details on high-level changes and its 2025 strategy in the coming days.",

        "Extracted Article": "Rental car startup Kyte, which bills itself as the best alternative to Hertz, is pulling out of almost all of its major markets in the United States and has cut its workforce roughly in half in a bid to survive after exploring a sale earlier this year. The company is shrinking its operations to focus only on San Francisco and New York City (including Jersey City) as it works to reach profitability in the next 18 months, CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch. Kyte has been exiting other major markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Seattle. It started telling customers in Los Angeles that it is suspending operations in that city after November 7, as Curbivore reported Thursday. Volk said Kyte recently cut between 40% and 50% of its workforce. The engineering, consumer, and growth product teams were among the most heavily affected, former employees told TechCrunch. In a capital-constrained environment, where capital is super expensive, we have to focus on our strongest markets, Volk said. Hard decisions had to be made in order to sustain the business here. Volk noted that New York and San Francisco are Kytes biggest markets, accounting for about 70% of its revenue. Kyte raised $9 million in 2021 and closed a $60 million Series B in 2022, all on the premise of being a flexible, easy-to-use rental car service that would go so far as to deliver the vehicle to your door. When announcing the Series B raise, the company said it wanted to be the worlds largest operator of shared, electrified, and autonomous fleets. The company rapidly expanded to more than a dozen markets in the U.S., and started borrowing heavily to finance the purchase of its vehicles. The company struck a $200 million debt financing deal in 2022 with Goldman Sachs and Ares Capital, and another $250 million agreement in March 2024 with Barclays and Waterfall Asset Management. Over the summer, though, Volk said it was becoming clear that the unit economics of Kytes business did not currently work well enough to generate free cash flow in those markets. He said his team explored selling the business at one point but decided to restructure instead in favor of reaching profitability first. That was only going to be possible if Kyte narrowed its focus, he said, hence the restructuring. Volk also said that the company recently completed a new fundraise to capitalize the restructured business, but he said he was not ready to share how much. The rental and subscription car service space has gone through hard times recently, especially for companies that leaned heavily into electrification. Hertz said in 2021 that it was going to buy 100,000 Teslas to fill its rental fleet with electric cars, but the company wound up only purchasing around 35,000. It sold the majority of those earlier this year. Autonomy, a startup created by TrueCar founder Scott Painter, fell far short of its own goal to build a fleet of 23,000 EVs; earlier this year it announced a pivot to selling software services and data. Despite the claims Kyte made in 2022, Volk said his company never got too deep in the process of filling its fleet with EVs — something that may have allowed the company to attempt this restructuring at all. That was very good, retrospectively, that we did not lose a bunch of capital here on residual values falling down, he said. This story has been updated with additional context about revenue and cash flow in Kytes markets.",

        "Extracted Article": "CapWay, a Y Combinator-backed fintech that sought to bring financial services to those in so-called banking deserts, has been shut down, according to its founder Sheena Allen. Allen wrote about it on LinkedIn and confirmed to TechCrunch. “I am proud of the work we were able to accomplish, but honestly disappointed that we couldn’t complete the mission,” she wrote. “I feel strongly that there is still much work to be done in the financial inclusion space, so it won’t be the last you hear of me in regard to fighting for economic equality.”&nbsp; Allen told TechCrunch the company started to wind down last year and waited this long to announce after a possible acquisition fell through.&nbsp; Banking deserts are people in communities, often rural, that have no nearby physical bank branch to obtain a checking account. The term is also extended to people who have difficulty going to a bank, such as lower-income, older, or disabled individuals. Allen (pictured above) launched CapWay in 2016 after realizing the impact that not having a bank account has on some communities, such as depending on high-interest payday loans or high-fee cash-checking services, as CNN reported. CapWay’s company planned to address this population by teaching financial literacy and offering online banking solutions. PitchBook shows the company raised just under $800,000 in funding from investors, including Backstage Capital, Fearless Fund, and Khosla Ventures. It was part of YCs Summer 2020 cohort, as TechCrunch reported at the time. Allen told us there were a few reasons why she shut the company down. She cited the fact that the fintech industry took a huge reputational hit after the hacking of Evolve Bank &amp; Trust and the collapse of Synapse, the latter of which saw hundreds of millions of dollars of consumer funds frozen.&nbsp; After that, many banks that looked to partner with fintechs required the fintech to have a certain amount of money in the bank.&nbsp; “It takes money to play in a highly regulated industry because you can’t control the changes,” Allen said. “You just have to have enough money and time to survive the adjustments.”&nbsp; CapWay had to find a new banking partner during this time but needed to raise more money to meet potential partners’ money-on-hand requirements, which it struggled to do. Some investors turned her away by citing that the company lagged too far behind its competitor. But she also pointed out the challenge that has pained many Black founders this past year.&nbsp; “Fundraising itself was down for everyone, but it was and is extremely down for Black founders,” she said. Crunchbase found that Black founders raised only 0.3% of the $79 billion that went to U.S.-based startups in the first half of the year. Allen often felt like she was in competition with other Black-founded fintechs for that smaller piece of pie. She wrote in her post that some investors turned her down by telling her that they had already invested in another Black-founded debit card fintech. “Some investors like to group all Black fintech companies into one box, [even] when we don’t all do or operate the same or have the same target audience,” she told us. “It’s unfortunate, but that was a factor in us being told no a few times.”&nbsp; Allen thanked her team and some of her investors in her LinkedIn post, pointing out that there were investors who “still called and not only checked on the business and me as a founder but me as a human.” She also thanked her fellow founders who “listened to me rant and called to simply check on my mental state through this process.”&nbsp; But one failed startup — which is almost a badge of honor in the startup world — has not deterred her from her love of building companies. She still wants to work in the financial inclusion space and is pondering her next startup idea. She’s currently looking at some potential entrepreneur-in-resident opportunities at venture firms. “It’s a rough time to wind down your company,” she said. “But I’ve learned there’s beauty in the journey even on cloudy days when things seem dark.”",

Founded in 2020, Drata integrates with dozens of clouds, SaaS apps, developer tools, security systems, and more, helping businesses collate the necessary evidence to prove that their data privacy and security practices are in order. While layoffs have continued to plague the tech industry in 2024, Drata reported some impressive growth metrics just seven months back. For its fiscal year 2024 (FY24), the San Diego-based company claimed 100% revenue growth year-on-year, said that it was adding 650 new customers each quarter, and made a string of senior executive hires. Notably, Drata also said at that time that it had increased its headcount by 52% across seven countries over the previous year, a figure that will undoubtedly have grown in the months that followed as it made its first acquisitions starting with Harmonize in April, followed by Oak9 a month later. But growth doesnt necessarily convert into a healthy bottom line, particularly if a company has grown too quickly. Drata alluded to sustainable growth in a statement to TechCrunch after we received a tip about the layoffs. Drata continues its 3.5 years of extraordinary growth and has refined its organizational structure, reducing its workforce by 9%, the company said in an email sent by the companys director of communications, Sophia Hatef. We are incredibly grateful for the impacted employees and their contributions. This strategic move aims to enhance operational efficiency and drive sustainable growth as the company charts its course toward a potential IPO in the future. Drata has raised well over $300 million in funding, the bulk of which came via a $200 million investment in December 2022, which gave the company a valuation of $2 billion.

Bending Spoons acquired the Dutch company in July for an undisclosed amount. The company confirmed the plans for the WeTransfer layoff to TechCrunch. The staff that is being let go will be informed after Bending Spoons goes through local regulations in different countries regarding layoffs. Dutch media reported that WeTransfer has over 350 employees. Bending Spoons CEO Luca Ferrari said that typically, the company studies the organization that it is acquiring and determines what is the best vision of the business going forward with an aim to operate it forever. Once the vision is clear, we try to close the gap between the status quo and the vision as quickly and as fully as we can. Typically, doing so involves making major changes to many areas, including the organization. While we don’t enjoy making painful or unpopular decisions, we’re prepared to do so when we believe it’s the right thing to do to help the business thrive, he said. Ferrari also noted that in WeTransfers case, Bending Spoons wanted to have a small and focused team. In this particular case, the vision we developed is of a smaller, more sharply focused WeTransfer organization, which we believe will be better positioned to serve WeTransfer’s success with a long-term view, the CEO said. Since its acquisition, WeTransfer has rolled out a new feature to let users extend the expiry date of a link on the app. However, neither Bending Spoons nor WeTransfer hasnt disclosed their plans about long-term product roadmap. The layoffs are not surprising, as Bending Spoons regularly cuts the employee count of companies it acquires in order to operate them profitably. In February 2023, it cut 129 employees from Evernote’s staff. In December 2023, the company let go of the entire workforce of Filmic, the popular photo and video editing app that it acquired in 2022. Earlier this year, Meetup also faced job cuts after its acquisition. In February, Bending Spoons raised $155 million in equity financing from new investor Durable Capital Partners and existing ones, including Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, NB Renaissance, NUO Capital, and StarTIP (controlled by Tamburi Investment Partners).

The company launched its AI assistant, Leo, on desktop, Android, iPad, and iPhone in a staggered release cycle. The company integrated its own search results with its Leo chatbot in June. Users could, for example, use the chatbot to ask about the score of a sports match or get additional context about an article they are reading without navigating to a search page.

        "Extracted Article": "Formlabs on Thursday confirmed that it has laid off a “small number” of employees, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The 3D printing firm says the figure amounts to less than 40 of a total headcount of just under 750 employees. The layoffs occurred in waves over the past two years, and as recently as the last few weeks. A spokesperson for the company confirmed the staff reduction. In a statement to TechCrunch, the spokesperson noted: We routinely review every part of the organization to make sure the roles we have best support our customers and enable us to deliver great products. At the same time, we are hiring new roles across all divisions and geographies and are heavily investing in R&amp;D. While we continue to grow revenue and lead in the additive manufacturing market, we occasionally must make the difficult decision to part ways with a small number of colleagues who are in departments that are below our efficiency goals and/or who are not in the right roles. The MIT spinoff has been a rare success story in the 3D printing market, as the first to bring high-precision SLA (stereolithography) printing to the desktop form factor. Prior to its arrival, that corner of the market was almost exclusively made up of FDM (fused deposition modeling) printers, which deposit melted plastic layer by layer, in a manner similar to a hot glue gun. SLA, meanwhile, uses light to form a resin into a solid, high-resolution structure. Formlabs weathered the burst of the original desktop 3D printing bubble, which saw many companies close up shop. Others, such as MakerBot, were acquired by larger companies. Broader macro issues have caused prolonged issues for much of the competition. More recently, Formlabs has expanded into SLS (selective laser sintering) technology with its Fuse. As the name implies, the technology uses lasers to sinter powder. According to a recent post from the company’s chief product officer, Formlabs currently “ships more than 50% of all SLS units in the world.” The company also recently acquired two-person SLS startup Micronics.

        "Extracted Article": "Tally, a nine-year-old fintech that helped consumers manage and pay off their credit card debt, has shut down, according to the company. In a LinkedIn post that was shared earlier Monday, founder and CEO Jason Brown said the “sad and difficult” decision to close down Tally was not the outcome the company had “hoped for,” but that “after exploring all options,” it was “unable to secure the necessary funding to continue our operations.” According to PitchBook, Tally was last valued at $855 million and had 183 employees. Tally’s model was initially designed to help people manage their credit cards and pay off high-interest debt through a lower interest loan that it offered. But in April, Tally announced it would be sunsetting its consumer app and shifting to B2B. At the time, the company said it had a launch partner, a “large publicly-traded consumer company with more than 50 million users,” that was launching in July. However, it never followed up with an announcement naming the company. TechCrunch has reached out to the company for further details. Founded in 2015, San Francisco-based Tally had raised $172 million in funding over the years. In October of 2022, Tally raised an $80 million Series D led by Sway Ventures. Andreessen Horowitz led its $50 million Series C round in 2019, which also included participation from Silicon Valley heavy hitters such as Kleiner Perkins, Shasta Ventures, Cowboy Ventures and Sway Ventures.

This is the company’s fifth round since April 2021, when it cut back 100 staffers.&nbsp; Rad’s latest layoffs follow a culling a year ago, when the e-bike maker pulled out of Europe and laid off around 40 employees.&nbsp;Rad laid off staff twice in 2022. The layoffs at the popular e-bike startup come after VanMoof, another venture-backed e-bike darling, declared bankruptcy last year. The turbulence in the e-bike industry has demonstrated that manufacturing and shipping two-wheelers is a tough business to get right, particularly if a startup is under pressure to scale quickly to provide investors with a return on investment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rad did not share how many staffers it cut in July or which teams were affected. Sources familiar with the layoffs told TechCrunch the cuts mostly hit Rad’s product development teams. According to LinkedIn, Rad Power employs 394 people. “Earlier this month, Rad Power Bikes made the difficult decision to reduce our teams size so we can ensure the brands longevity, continue on our mission, and serve our rider community, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. We are doing all we can to approach this very difficult time with compassion and care. We believe in and care deeply about our vision to create a world where transportation is energy-efficient, enjoyable, and accessible to all. We have faced the challenges many businesses have, including rising costs and economic headwinds, and this difficult decision was necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of Rads business.” A spokesperson for the company said Rad will continue to provide service and support to its customers with daily live phone and chat customer service, as well as through more than 1,200 retail and service providers throughout North America.&nbsp; Rad Power Bikes, known for their affordable fat tire e-bikes, has gone through some shake-ups since its meteoric rise to popularity that was fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the company’s founder, Mike Radenbaugh, stepped down as CEO and into the role of chairman. He was replaced by Phil Molyneux, who previously served as president at Sony Electronics and Dyson America. Correction: A previous version of this story stated Rad Power Bikes made their bikes in the U.S. They are made in Asia.",

        "Extracted Article": "Match Group announced Tuesday that it has discontinued livestreaming services in its dating apps, resulting in a 6% reduction in workforce. The news was delivered during the dating app giants second-quarter earnings report. The move finds Match shifting its focus to other offerings, including generative AI. The decision to end livestreaming will directly impact dating apps Plenty of Fish (POF) and BLK, which launched a free livestreaming feature — Live! — in 2020. The offerings were a bid to encourage users to date virtually during the COVID-19 lockdown. Users could also purchase “Live Credits” to send virtual dates to streamers, similar to TikTok Live. According to posts on their respective help pages, BLK’s Live feature ends on August 19, whereas POF users will be unable to livestream after August 31. Additionally, Match is shutting down the Hakuna app, acquired through its purchase of social networking company Hyperconnect in 2021. The app featured livestreams where hosts engaged with users primarily in Korea and Japan. The company stated that ending livestreaming in a post-pandemic world makes sense, as it was a popular feature when users craved connection during isolation. As the world moves beyond the pandemic, the company has seen a shift in user behavior.&nbsp; In its earnings call to investors, Match Group CFO Gary Swidler emphasized how customer behavior has changed since 2020. “When we entered in livestreaming a few years ago, you know the world was different it was pre-COVID and everything else but livestreaming at that point, we thought provided attractive kind of adjacent additional source of revenue for us,” Swidler said. Hinge, another Match-owned dating app, quietly ended its in-app audio and video calling feature last year for similar reasons, as more users have returned to in-person dates. Revenue sharing also played a role in Matchs decision. Livestreaming has the same types of expenses as we see in our other dating businesses, but there’s one significant difference, which is we need to provide a revenue share to the livestreamers, said Swidler. And that can be 20% or more of the revenue, so that’s an extra expense that we really don’t see in our dating businesses. There is also significant competition with social media platforms like TikTok. “This year we expected roughly a $60 million revenue contribution from livestreaming, but growing that revenue base has become much more challenging in the face of the competition and the changed landscape and dynamics that were facing. Not only that but to reach the scale that we need to reach to achieve even reasonable margins from our perspective, was going to take a significant amount of investment for a significant number of years, even in the best-case scenario,” Swindler added. This decision to end livestreaming is expected to result in approximately $60 million in annual revenue loss. Yet its also estimated to result in $13 million in annual cost savings. Match tells investors that this shift will allow Match to focus on businesses where it has “proven advantages,” such as generative AI.&nbsp; Regarding the job cuts, Match Group plans to redeploy some of the Hyperconnect employees who have expertise in artificial intelligence to popular apps Tinder and Hinge. The company has increased its focus on AI in recent years, including an AI-powered photo selector for Tinder profiles.&nbsp; Speaking of Tinder, the app experienced declines in paid users for the seventh quarter in a row. The figure declined 8% to 9.6 million in Q2, compared to 10 million in the prior quarter. In February 2023, Match laid off 8% of staff, or 200 employees.",

        "Extracted Article": "Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky will lay off dozens of staff and leave the U.S. market following a U.S. government order in June banning the sale of the companys software, citing security risks. Kaspersky said it will gradually wind down” its U.S. operations beginning July 20, when the ban comes into effect, adding that its U.S. business is no longer viable. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first broke the news on Monday of the company shutting down its stateside business. Zetter said the number of employees affected by the layoffs is less than 50 in the United States.&nbsp; Kaspersky spokesperson Sawyer VanHorn confirmed the companys statement and layoffs to TechCrunch in an email Tuesday. The spokesperson was also part of the layoffs, said VanHorn. Kaspersky initially planned to challenge the ban, saying at the time the ban was announced that it does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security, and that it would pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships. In June, the U.S. Commerce Department announced the first of its kind ban on the sale of Kasperskys antivirus software to U.S. consumers, citing increased security and privacy risks because the company is headquartered in Russia.&nbsp; “Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans, U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, said in a call with reporters at the time. Once the ban comes into effect, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to sell its software to U.S. consumers directly or through U.S.-based resellers of Kaspersky software, some of whom have criticized the ban for affecting their businesses. After September 29, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to push software or security updates to U.S. customers. That will result in degraded protection from the antivirus software. The Commerce Department said it took a staggered approach to the ban to allow U.S. consumers to find an alternative to Kaspersky software. The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned several senior Kaspersky executives, effectively barring U.S. customers from paying Kaspersky for its software or transacting with any future company run by its executives. Chief executive Eugene Kaspersky was not sanctioned, the Treasury said.&nbsp; The U.S. government has acted against Kaspersky during both the Trump and Biden administrations. In 2017, the Trump administration banned the use of Kaspersky software across the federal government after Russian government hackers earlier that year stole U.S. classified documents from an intelligence contractors home computer, which was running Kaspersky software at the time. By their nature, antivirus products typically have broad, if not complete, access to the devices they are installed on to identify malicious cyber threats. When seen by TechCrunch on Tuesday, Kasperskys products were unavailable for purchase on its U.S. website. For legal compliance purposes, Kaspersky products cannot be purchased from your country, its website reads. Updated with Kaspersky comment.

        "Extracted Article": "Indian edtech giant Unacademy is laying off about 250 employees. This is the latest in a series of job cuts at the company after schools reopened across the country following the pandemic lockdowns. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, valued at $3.4 billion in its last funding in 2021, is letting go of 100 people in marketing, business and product, and about 150 in sales, according to a source familiar with the situation. The layoffs bring Unacademys total job cuts to about 2,000 since the second half of 2022. An Unacademy spokesperson confirmed the layoffs but didnt elaborate on how many individuals were impacted. The spokesperson said the restructuring exercise was necessary for staying on the companys goal of reaching profitability. The startup counts General Atlantic, SoftBank and Peak XV among its backers. The layoffs come in the midst of a potential merger discussion with K12 Techno, which owns school chain Orchid International, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Edtech firms across the world saw their fortunes skyrocket as students signed up for courses en masse during the pandemic lockdowns. But once schools reopened, these firms saw enrollment crater. Notably, the sudden collapse of Byjus, once the countrys most valuable startup, has shaken confidence in the sector to an extent. Prosus, the largest external investor of Byjus, last month wrote down its 9.6% stake in the startup to zero amid growing troubles and governance issues at the Indian firm. Unacademy, which offers online courses for Indias most competitive exams, has been cutting costs for two years while also expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint and experiences. Gaurav Munjal, the companys co-founder and CEO, said in an X thread last week that an offline play was a must for businesses building in India. He also said startups raised capital in 2021 at bloated valuations, adding, This is not market correction. This is the reality. 2021 wasnt. He also alleged that Byjus failed because its founder didnt listen to anyone. He put himself on a pedestal and stopped listening. Don’t do that, Munjal wrote. Never do that. Don’t listen to everyone but have people who can give you blunt feedback.",

        "Extracted Article": "The Indian social media platform Koo, which positioned itself as a competitor to Elon Musks X, is ceasing operations after its last-resort acquisition talks with Dailyhunt collapsed. Despite securing over $60 million in funding from prominent investors, including Accel and Tiger Global, Koo faced significant challenges in expanding its user base and generating revenue over the past two years. TechCrunch exclusively reported in February that Koo was engaging with Dailyhunt, an internet media startup valued at $5 billion, for a potential sale. The talks didnt materialize into a deal, Koo founders said Wednesday. We explored partnerships with multiple larger internet companies, conglomerates and media houses but these talks didnt yield the outcome we wanted, Koo founders Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka wrote in a LinkedIn post. Most of them didnt want to deal with user generated content and the wild nature of a social media company. Koo sought to win users in India by giving them an X-like platform where they could express themselves in multiple local languages. Koo initially gained popularity in India during a period of tension between Twitter and the Indian government. The conflict emerged after Twitter challenged the governments opaque requests for content removal. Last year Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey alleged that the Indian government had threatened to shut down the social network in the country and raid the homes of its employees. (The Indian government refuted Dorseys allegations and a top minister at the time said Dorsey was attempting to brush out that very dubious period of Twitters history.) Koo took advantage of the situation and positioned itself as a more compliant alternative, pledging to adhere to local regulations. This approach attracted numerous high-profile Indian politicians to the platform, though nearly none from the opposition party. The startup had also expanded its eponymous app to Brazil. But a prolonged funding winter, which forced startups globally to scale their revenue and improve their finances, got the better of us, Koo founders said. For years, Indian entrepreneurs and investors have raced to create homegrown alternatives to popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube. Its becoming increasingly evident that these established American companies are demonstrating superior capability in serving even the most diverse segments of the Indian market.",

        "Extracted Article": "New York-based Revel has made a lot of pivots since initially launching in 2018 as a dockless e-moped sharing service. The BlackRock-backed startup briefly stepped into the e-bike subscription business. It launched and now operates a handful of electric vehicle charging stations across the five boroughs. And it started an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hail service, in part so its charging infrastructure would see guaranteed utilization.&nbsp; After dropping the moped-sharing business in 2023, Revel is pivoting once again to abandon one of the main things that made its ride-hail service unique: The startup is laying off its 1,000+ drivers and embracing a gig worker model similar to that of rivals Lyft and Uber. The move comes after Revel successfully piloted the model in late February with 100 Revel drivers and has since brought on 100 more. “The reason we ran this pilot in the first place was just increasing feedback from our driver pool, as well as in our recruitment efforts,” Haley Rubinson, vice president of corporate affairs at Revel, told TechCrunch. “The leading reason people didn’t want to join Revel was the lack of flexibility.” Rubinson, who was Revel’s first hire, said that drivers were initially attracted to the platform because they didn’t want to deal with the hassle of owning or renting their own vehicles, buying insurance, and managing their own expenses. Drivers have also told TechCrunch that filing their 1099 taxes can be frustrating. But now, Rubinson says, Revel is having trouble recruiting drivers to its platform.&nbsp; “We have to be responsive to what the industry is telling us,” said Rubinson.&nbsp; In the email sent to employees that TechCrunch has viewed and Bloomberg first reported on, Keith Williams, vice president of ride-share operations, said that four out of the five drivers who piloted the gig worker model would recommend the program. The question of flexibility has been at the heart of the debate over whether ride-hail drivers should be classified as gig workers or employees. If salaried employees are in fact asking to be made into contractors, Revel’s switch could lend credibility to arguments made by Uber and Lyft as the companies fight across the country to maintain their current gig worker models.&nbsp; “Now there really is the opportunity to serve more of the city’s for-hire vehicle population,” said Rubinson. Current drivers on Revel’s payroll will have the option of staying on with the company as independent contractors after September 12, when the switch will take effect. Drivers can sign up to rent from Revel’s fleet of Teslas for $10 per hour, which includes auto liability insurance, vehicle cleaning and maintenance and a full day of battery charging.&nbsp; In 2025, Revel will open up the platform to drivers with their own EVs, giving the startup an asset-light way to grow the business and offer riders a better service. Revel has made over 2.5 million rides with its fleet of 550 Teslas, but customer wait times have been a problem with such a small fleet. Especially when compared to Uber and Lyft, whose driver numbers are collectively over 100,000 in NYC, according to the companies. That said, Rubinson says Revel’s ride-hail portion of the business recently hit gross margin positivity and was tracking to be EBITDA positive by the end of the year.&nbsp; The increased fleets may also help Revel with its actual long-term bet — EV charging infrastructure. In 2022, Frank Reig, Revel’s CEO, told TechCrunch that over 90% of its charging hub utilization came from Revel’s own ride-hail fleet. That number has since shifted to about 50% as EV adoption increases, according to Robert Familiar, Revel’s senior corporate affairs manager. Revel has three active EV charging hubs in NYC — two in Brooklyn (Bed Stuy and South Williamsburg) and one in Long Island City, Queens. The startup aims to launch another hub this summer at Pier 36 in Lower Manhattan right off FDR Drive, a highway that runs along the East River. Rubinson said Revel also plans to launch three more: One near LaGuardia Airport; another in Maspeth, Queens, that’ll be the largest site with 60 plugs; and another in the Bronx.&nbsp; Outside of New York, Revel is eyeing San Francisco and Los Angeles.&nbsp; In total, Revel has raised around $214 million since its launch, per Crunchbase data. TechCrunch has reached out to backers at BlackRock, Toyota Ventures and Maniv to learn how investors view the startup’s latest shift but did not hear back in time.&nbsp;",

        "Extracted Article": "It’s not just instant-delivery startups that are struggling. Oda, the Norway-based online supermarket delivery startup, has confirmed layoffs of 150 jobs as it drastically scales back its expansion ambitions to focus on just two markets, its home base and Sweden, the home base of Mathem, an online grocery retailer that Oda merged with last year. Oda, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and was once valued as high as $900 million in a round led by SoftBank in its Vision Fund investment heyday, now says its aim is to become profitable in the two countries sometime next year. Oda’s retreat mirrors what we’ve seen play out in the instant grocery delivery space, where a number of startups have either sold down or been acquired for pennies on each dollar raised as they have struggled to get the unit economics to work amid sluggish growth. That all appeared to come to a major head in April, when Getir, the startup out of Turkey that raised $2.3 billion, announced layoffs and a retreat to its home market in pursuit of getting out of the red.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grocery is the largest category in retail, but even the most capable organizations in the world have struggled to find an online model that works. Online grocery is hard — complex orders with perishable items and a multi-temperature supply chain in a highly price sensitive category, Odas CEO, Chris Poad, wrote on LinkedIn last week (before the layoffs were announced). Poad’s very presence at the company is part of its efforts to get out of that “struggle.” With past experience at Amazon, Tesco and Google, Poad only joined the company in April himself, taking over from co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas. Munthe-Kaas, meanwhile, left after he was reportedly asked by the board to step aside due to what Norwegian media described as Oda’s foreign fiasco. In short, Oda, riding on hundreds of millions in funding and the pandemic boom for online grocery delivery, had big ambitions to scale across the Nordics and Northern Europe. But in 2023, the company announced plans to end its retail operations in Finland after just one year; Germany soon followed. Oda may have been retrenching its own-brand expansions, but it was also consolidating with other, existing grocery retailers: Its merger with Sweden’s Mathem came later in 2023 — a deal that Oda claimed would make it the largest online grocery retailer in the Nordics with over NOK 5 billion ($471 million) in revenue. Now Oda’s confirmed its international expansion strategy is postponed. The company’s state of affairs is a stark reminder of both the exuberance of investors pre-2022, as well as the difficulties that have followed as startups failed to meet growth projections.&nbsp; Prior to the pandemic, Oda — founded in 2013 — carved out a place for itself as one of the strong regional players in online grocery delivery in Europe. (Others include Ocado out of the U.K., Rohlik in the Czech Republic, Picnic in the Netherlands and Everli in Italy.) Cue the pandemic and a massive surge of online shopping as people sheltered in place. By 2021, SoftBank, via its Vision Fund, led a $265 million round for the company at a valuation of $900 million. But by late 2022 Oda was raising $151 million at a valuation of $353 million.&nbsp; Now, based on recent financial reporting from Kinnevik, its largest shareholder, the companys pre-layoffs value would have been just SEK 2.56 billion, or $245 million. Oda, the Norwegian grocery delivery startup, raises a fresh $151M, but at a lowered valuation of $353M Layoffs are often one of the signals not just of a company looking to cut costs, but also sometimes of one looking to firm up its balance sheet ahead of a fundraise. And that’s what it looks like Oda is trying to do now, based on one report. Local publication E24 says Kinnevik and other existing backers Summa Equity and Verdane are expected to provide the bulk of the NOK600 million ($57 million) Oda is reportedly raising. It is unclear what that will translate to in terms of valuation given the other developments.",

Engineering and product design were among the departments impacted by the cuts, according to posts on LinkedIn from impacted employees. TechCrunch was unable to independently verify the exact number of people who were cut, but an industry source who knew impacted people believes it was approximately half of Jasper Healths small team. According to PitchBook data, Jasper Health had about 48 employees before the cuts. The companys co-founder and CEO, Adam Pellegrini, didnt respond to TechCrunchs request for comment. TechCrunchs attempts to reach Jasper Healths chief operating officer, chief growth officer, and head of marketing via email were unsuccessful, with messages bouncing back. A little over two years ago, in February 2022, Jasper Health raised a $25 million Series A led by General Catalyst, with participation from Human Capital, W Health Ventures, Redesign Health and 7wireVentures. At that time, the company said it raised a total of $31 million in venture capital. Most significantly, Jasper is a General Catalyst portfolio company. The VC firm is one of the most active healthcare investors. It is so serious about bringing new startup-led technology into the US healthcare system that earlier this year, the VC firm purchased an Ohio-based health system called Suma Health, an unprecedented move in venture capital. But clearly, that doesnt mean that all GC-backed health tech startups will flourish up-and-to-the-right without setbacks. Jasper is also notable because it was conceived and launched in 2018 by Redesign Health, a venture firm and studio that creates new healthcare companies. Run by CEO Brett Shaheen (previously at Lone Pine Capital and Carlyle Group), Redesign says its built 50 healthcare startups that have collectively raised $1.3 billion. Redesign, which is itself backed by LPs like General Catalyst, CVS Health Ventures, and Samsung Next, also had its own layoffs earlier this year, Fierce Healthcare reported. Jaspers digital but human-led platform offers care navigation, patient support and remote patient monitoring. The company also provides psychosocial care. It says that approximately 12% of its users are in remission from cancer. Pelligrini, the companys founder, started his career as a surgical specialist in the US Army. He also helped build the American Cancer Societys website, which provides information to patients and caregivers about the disease. Before founding Jasper, he was the senior vice president of virtual care and consumer health innovation at CVS Health. Jasper Healths competitors include Thyme Care and Reimagine Care.",

Workers suspected layoffs were coming when the company directed everyone to work from home on Wednesday an out-of-character directive, according to multiple current and former employees. The layoffs were announced during an all-hands meeting held Wednesday morning. Founder and CEO Henrik Fisker told employees that the large investor his company owes money to and the chief restructuring officer working on the investors behalf wanted to let more people go, according to employees who attended. Fisker has never disclosed who is ultimately behind the convertible debt investment in question, though Henrik Fisker did reference Heights Capital Management during Wednesdays meeting when discussing the layoffs, according to the two employees. Heights Capital Management is an affiliate of financial services giant Susquehanna International Group. One current and one laid off employee estimated that only about 150 people remain at the company. Fisker has already gone through several rounds of layoffs. It&nbsp;announced cuts&nbsp;of 15% in February. Fisker employed 1,135 people as of April 19, according to a regulatory filing. Those workforce numbers were reduced by an unknown amount after another round of layoffs in late April, and another series in late May before Wednesdays cuts. Fisker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Restructuring officer John DiDonato also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DiDonato previously told Californias Employment Development Department on April 29 that it planned to lay off more than 300 workers on June 28 if the company was unable to address its operating cash requirements, according to documents obtained by TechCrunch. Despite the widespread cuts, Henrik Fisker struck a somber-but-determined tone during the call, according to sources. At one point, he noted that the company built something great and would continue to sell its one and only EV — the Ocean SUV — to people who want to buy them. He also suggested that laid off workers would be re-hired once the company is back up and running, according to the account of one person who attended the meeting. Many workers initially learned they were laid off after losing access to Microsoft services like Teams or Outlook. Later in the day, some employees received an email officially announcing they were terminated with one week of severance. Laid-off employees echoed similar details in posts on LinkedIn. These new layoffs come after months of troubles at Fisker, and less than a year after the company began full-scale deliveries of the Ocean SUV.",

Per an email sent out to staffers Thursday afternoon by current CEO Gary Little and viewed by TechCrunch, 105 employees were just let go as the company seeks to “streamline” its operations, and “set the company on more sustainable financial footing.” Impacted employees saw their system access removed upon receipt of Foursquare’s notification email. Little didnt return a request for comment by the time of this post’s publication on Thursday evening, and his letter to employees doesn’t shed much light on Foursquare’s go-forward plan. According to one source, the layoffs represent roughly 25% of the companys employees. The letter does, however, address which units were impacted and, relatedly, the divisions that Foursquare plans to ditch, including Visits, OCF, and Foursquare City Guide.&nbsp; According to Little’s letter, Foursquare is also pausing work on a number of other initiatives, including “Mobile Developers Tools, Geode, and the current version of FSQ Insights.”&nbsp; Foursquare, a darling during the earlier days of the iPhone that invited users to “check in” at locations to earn badges, and which relied on hyperlocal ad revenue to fuel its business, later evolved into an enterprise tech company that sees brands and publishers leverage its data. For example, Atmosfy, a seed-funded short-form video platform that invites users to explore local businesses, uses Foursquares API to bolster its own app. After its merger with Factual, whose location software helped marketers zero in on customer segments – say, people in the market for a new home — Foursquare moved even further in that same direction.&nbsp; Today’s layoffs aren’t the first to hit Foursquare. Employees were laid off at the time of the merger and some reported a separate round of layoffs in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp; Little stepped into the role of CEO in late 2020, roughly six months after Foursquare’s all-stock merger with Factual was announced (the combined outfit ditched the Factual brand). The financial terms of the deal were never disclosed, but Little was largely installed to protect and grow an investment in Foursquare by The Raine Group, a merchant bank where Little was previously a managing director and which led a $150 million round of funding in Foursquare in 2019.&nbsp; Foursquare has not publicly reported a new funding round since that time. The 15-year-old company has raised an estimated $400 million over the years.",

TechCrunch has learned that the company on Tuesday laid off roughly 30% of its staff, or north of two dozen employees. Silo has confirmed the headcount reductions, clarifying the cuts were across the board and not focused on individual departments. Silo shared the following statement with TechCrunch regarding the layoffs: We recently made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by almost 30%. We are committed to supporting those team members impacted and have provided severance packages and recruiting support. At the same time, Silo remains dedicated to serving our customers and the perishables industry at large, and will continue to focus more nimbly on building next-generation supply chain management software solutions. Founded in 2018, Silos platform helps automate the workflows of food and agricultural businesses and later expanded into other areas, like payment products for accounts payable and receivable automation, inventory management, ledger accounting, financing and more. Ahead of the layoffs was an issue around a lending product that had hurt Silos revenue. A company source confirmed that a customer had become delinquent on their loan, which caused Silos banking partner to pause the loan product. Silo then worked with the bank to resolve the problem with the customer, so the facility has the ability to fund again. While Silo is now able to lend, the lack of payment from that customer and the overall pause in lending was difficult for the business. For that reason, Silo will likely be careful about ramping up the lending product as it moves forward. This all took place in recent weeks. However, its possible that if Silo had implemented stronger risk management processes, it wouldnt have faced the default. In addition, were hearing Silo is engaged in M&amp;A discussions as another possible resolution to its current situation. The company had previously engaged in discussions with potential deal partners ahead of its Series C last year, but the fundraise allowed Silo to pause those talks for a time. In recent weeks, those M&amp;A discussions have picked back up again on the back of new growth the company saw last year as well as the possible need for an exit. The startup raised $32 million in Series C funding last summer. Investors include Initialized, Haystack, Tribe Capital, KDT, a16z and others.",

This reduction is a strategic measure aimed at strengthening our financial position and maintaining our competitive edge in the talent acquisition and management segments.

At that time, the company’s revenue was growing 300% a year and its annual recurring revenue (ARR) ranged between $25 million and $50 million. But the recruiting environment has changed substantially since then.

Tech giants, such as Alphabet and Meta, have laid off many thousands of workers throughout 2022 and 2023. The trend inevitably hurt SeekOut’s business: The company’s software helps large companies in industries such as technology, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, defense and banking identify “hard to find” and diverse candidates.

Around 145 of the laid-off employees came from Pittsburgh, according to a WARN notice filed with Pennsylvania’s Department of Labor and Industry this week. Most of the employees in Pittsburgh worked on software, according to a source familiar with the matter. Another 129 employees came from Motionals Las Vegas team, according to a WARN notice filed in Nevada. Motionals Vegas employees are made up of remote vehicle assist teams, vehicle operators and testing. According to updated WARN notices filed in California, 52 employees were cut from Motionals Venice office, and another 41 from Milpitas. Both offices had teams working in high performance compute, autonomy, system operations and product, according to a Motional employee. Motional was also testing in Massachusetts, but WARN notices in that state have not yet been filed. One source said the autonomy and infrastructure software teams were pretty unaffected. Still, Motional is left with a smaller workforce to help improve its core technology and business model while holding onto what limited capital it has left.&nbsp; One of the sources at Motional told TechCrunch the company has a lot of improvements to make on its technology. Until this week, Motional had been running robotaxi rides in Las Vegas on the Uber and Lyft networks and delivering to Uber Eats customers in Santa Monica. At all times, a human safety operator had been behind the wheel, in addition to another specialist in the passenger seat to manually log any issues. Meanwhile, Motional’s main competition Waymo is offering fully autonomous rides in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Motional did not comment on any of the specifics in this article, but offered the following statement: We’ve updated our strategic plan to focus resources on the continued development and generalization of our core driverless technology, while de-emphasizing near-term commercial deployments and ancillary activities. This updated strategy requires a streamlining of our teams, resulting in a&nbsp;reduction in staff across all functions of the business. The team members leaving Motional have our deepest appreciation for their contributions to our goals. Hyundai investment Motional was originally the product of a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv. The company’s future was put into doubt earlier this year when Aptiv announced plans to reduce its ownership interest and stop allocating capital to the venture due to the high cost of commercializing a robotaxi business and the long road ahead to profits. Aptiv expects to reduce its equity interest in Motion from 50% as of March 31 to about 15%, leaving Hyundai with the remainder of control. A week ago, Hyundai pumped Motional with a $475 million round and spent another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv’s common equity interest in the company. This follows a bridge loan that Motional secured in March as a stand-in to this other investment to buy some time after laying off 5% of staffers a couple weeks prior.&nbsp; The layoffs at Motional are a sign of challenges in the autonomous vehicle industry, as fewer companies are able to keep spending billions of dollars on a technology that is far from ready for prime time and even further away from breaking even. More details on severance One employee who was laid off told TechCrunch those affected will continue to get a paycheck for 10 weeks with their last day slated for July 6. Rather than a lump sum payment, laid-off employees will get something called “garden leave,” which means they’ll be paid every two weeks like a normal paycheck, according to an off-boarding slide deck that TechCrunch has viewed.&nbsp; Employees will also receive an additional 28.5% bonus on top of the 20% bonus they received in March. Motional has asked employees to alert the company if they find a new job before July 6 in order to “avoid overlap in employment.” Employees with equity that vested in March 2024 will not be able to be paid out immediately because Motional is still waiting on its valuation to determine the new share price, per the deck.&nbsp; Correction: Information regarding the certain aspects of severance, specifically the bonus amount was incorrectly listed as only 28.5%, when in fact it was an additional 28.5%.

The cuts will affect around 140 employees, and are starting immediately. Luminar is also cutting ties with the majority of its contract workers. Today, we stand at the crossroads of two realities: the core of our business has never been stronger across technology, product, industrialization, and commercialization; yet at the same time the capital markets perception of our company has never been more challenging, billionaire founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a letter posted to Luminars website. [T]he business model and cost structure that enabled us to achieve this leadership position no longer fit the needs of the company. Russell wrote in the letter that the restructuring will make it possible for Luminar to get products to market faster, drastically reduce costs, and set the company up better for profitability. The company said in a regulatory filing that the changes will reduce operating costs by $50 million to $65 million on an annual basis. The company is also reducing its global footprint by sub-leasing portions or the entirety of certain facilities. Luminar will continue to operate its Florida facility, which is used for development, testing and research and development, according to spokesperson Milin Mehta. Luminar announced in April that it had begun shipping production lidar sensors to Volvo to be built into the automakers EX90 luxury SUV. It also announced plans to deepen its relationship with Taiwanese contract manufacturing company TPK Holding. TPK has committed to an exclusive relationship with Luminar, Russell wrote in his letter.",

        "Extracted Article": "Sprinklr, a U.S. firm offering a customer experience management platform to global brands, has laid off about 3% of its workforce — around 116 people — to realign its customer operations team, the company confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. The new job cuts come over a year after the company cut about 4% of its headcount in February last year. The New York-headquartered company, which counts Microsoft, Samsung, P&amp;G and over 60% of the Fortune 100 companies globally as customers, started notifying affected employees in markets including the U.S. and India about its decision on Thursday, TechCrunch exclusively learned and confirmed with the company through an email. Sprinklr made the strategic business decision to realign our headcount across our customer operations organization, a company spokesperson said. While these decisions are hard to make, they reflect the commitments weve outlined to restructure our business to accelerate our go-to-market efficiencies and better serve customers. The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts did not affect C-level roles. Sprinklr did not disclose the exact number of employees being laid off. According to its recent 10-K filing (PDF), the company had 3,869 employees worldwide as of January 31. Of the total workforce, Sprinklr had 787 in the U.S. and 3,082 internationally (with 2,276 employees in India). The restructuring will be done in accordance with local and country laws. This difficult, but necessary, action ensures we are aligned to our prioritized growth areas while supporting customers where they live and operate, the spokesperson stated. In March, Sprinklr reported a 17% year-on-year increase in its quarterly revenue for Q4 to $194.2 million from $165.3 million a year ago. The company also garnered GAAP operating income of $18.5 million compared to an operating loss of $1.8 million a year ago. While we will continue to hire in prioritized areas to support our growth, scale, and long-term success, our first priority is to support employees with the greatest care and respect, show appreciation for their contributions to Sprinklr, and to assist them in their transition. We will then continue our focus on strengthening our foundation, fostering innovation and enhancing our execution to drive value for our customers and shareholders, the spokesperson said. On Friday, Sprinklr was trading at $12.10 per share with a market cap of $3.30 billion.",

        "Extracted Article": "Ahead of Googles annual I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports from affected employees shared on social media. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go. As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our companys biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead, said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers, he added. The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, were told. In one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected a LOT of teams, and that lots of great projects lost people. Were sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond, wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart werent affected any more or less than other teams. We know yall care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem weve built together. Youre nervous. I get it. We get it. Youre betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google, he said. Google also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year. In a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were multiple current and former core devs and steering council members, they said. Meanwhile, others shared on Y Combinators Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy. [D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the marathon, not sprint approach to work. As I said in another comment, its the best job Ive ever had, and Ill miss it deeply, they wrote. Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team, the user, gpshead, also said. Though Google didnt detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale. CNBC reports that a total of 200 people were let go across Googles Core teams, which included those working on Python, app platforms, and other engineering roles. Some jobs were being shifted to India and Mexico, it said, citing internal documents. On social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didnt eliminate its Python team; it replaced that team with another group based in Munich — at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday. Its a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off — excuse me, had their roles reduced, and youre asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it, he said. Google said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.

        "Extracted Article": "True to its business concept, Turkeys instant delivery juggernaut Getir rose quickly. Now, with the quick commerce industry in free fall, it is nosediving just as fast. On Monday, the company once valued close to $12 billion announced it would shut down its operations the U.S., the U.K. and Europe to focus solely on its home market of Turkey. The move puts a bitter end to the companys very aggressive expansion strategy that saw it raise billions of dollars to grow organically and also snap up a number of equally aggressive, yet struggling, competitors to position itself as the market leader. The closures look like they will impact at least 6,000 jobs across the closing markets, but according to the company just 7% of its revenues. Alongside the closures, the company said it would get a new injection of investment as a lifeline to extend its runway. This decision will allow Getir to focus its financial resources on Turkey, the company said in a statement. Getir is not the only one in this space raising money to stay afloat while also retreating from global plans. Earlier this month, reports surfaced that Flink, an erstwhile rival of Getirs in Germany, is raising some $106 million, with around one-third of that secured so far. It comes as Flink, too, is consolidating its position. Coinciding with the fundraise leak, the company also apparently liquidated its operations in France. A source close to Flink tells me that in fact its weighing up whether to join up with another company or to raise more money. In other words, the instability in the market is creating uncertainty that is impacting others, too. More details on Getir, including financials: Layoffs: To be clear, Getir has only officially announced cuts of 1,500 in the U.K. in the short announcement that it sent out to journalists: no details on jobs impacted elsewhere. However, reports were surfacing over the last few days that it had started to send out notices to 1,800 employees in Germany HQ of Gorillas (which it acquired at the end of 2022). Weve been told by a source close to the company that the number is closer to 1,100 (one figure may include contractors). Meanwhile, when Getir acquired FreshDirect in the U.S. only six months ago, in November 2023 it picked up 2,300 employees. Add those different numbers together and you get around 6,000, although since Getir was already active in the U.S. prior to that acquisition, there may well be more impacted. A year ago, the company had as many as 32,000 people working for it. Its pandemic window of opportunity: The move is a grim chapter for the startup that was founded in 2015 and saw big traction in Turkey before the pandemic Getir means bring in Turkish. That led to aggressive investment and expansion that peaked during COVID-19, when consumers were shopping less in person in part to minimize infection, in part because shopping in person became really challenging due to supply issues, long lines to stagger entries and more. Just as ride-hailing companies like Uber raised aggressively to finance aggressive growth and competitive fights across the globe, so too did Getir: Between its first outside investment in 2017 and September 2023, it raised more than $2.3 billion from some 36 investors, including Sequoia, Tiger Global, Silver Lake, Mubadala, Goodwater, G Squared and A*. It also made some aggressive acquisitions of competitors to increase its position in the market but notably, it was consolidation intended not just as a power move, but also as a way for other struggling, cash-strapped players in the market to step out of the brutal race. In addition to FreshDirect and Gorillas, Getir picked up operations in Spain, Italy and the U.K. at bargain prices. It was also reportedly interested at one point in Zapp in the U.K. and Flink in Germany, so it definitely saw itself as a consolidator in the troubled market. It was a strategy also taken by Getirs biggest global competitor, Gopuff. Todays news leaves easier waters for Gopuff in the U.S. and the U.K. Its Turkish window of opportunity: This is a grim chapter, but not a final one. Getir also announced that it would be raising fresh money to double down on its home market, a round led by Mubadala and G Squared. Getir did not disclose who else was participating, nor how much it raised, nor whether this is equity or debt, so its hard to say what this means beyond giving the company some runway and a chance to focus on one market that has worked. We have reached out to some of its previous investors, Sequoia and Tiger Global, to see if they would comment on whether they are remaining investors in the company now or whether they have cashed out. Right now, the strategy for the bigger players in the instant grocery delivery market seems to be: accept that our international strategies were not great ideas and focus on just our core markets for now. The writing on the wall: Getir, like its peers in the instant delivery market, has been struggling for a while. In May 2023, it cut 14% of staff and canceled large parts of its geographic expansion plans as it scrambled to right-size the business ahead of more fundraising. Just weeks after that, it pulled out of Spain, Italy and Portugal in July 2023. At the time, it was well understood that it shut operations because those markets were just not thriving, but Getir was indeed trying to close another round of funding, so cutting loss-making operations makes sense in that context. Documents have been shared with TechCrunch that indicate that the company, for the calendar year 2023, made $3.3 billion, with the U.S. and Europe (including the U.K.) accounting for around $1 billion of that across the year. (Its not clear from Getirs statement what the 7% figure relates to. We are asking.) From the documents that we have seen, as of the end of last year, the company was not EBITDA positive in any of its geographies. Big, bad news in the chaotic market for instant delivery services, but given the states of the venture market, the current economy, and consumer behavior these days yes, people buy online, but they are also very much back outside, shopping like before it is likely not the last.

The move from the Indian ride-hailing startup is aimed at improving profitability, its founder and chairman, Bhavish Aggarwal, told employees in an email on Monday that was seen by TechCrunch. The company is undergoing a restructuring exercise to gear up for its next phase of growth, Aggarwal, pictured above, wrote in the email. The move comes in the wake of Ola ceasing its operations in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand earlier this month. Bakshi, a former executive at FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever, was appointed as Olas chief executive in January this year. Ola, which competes with Uber in India and counts SoftBank and Tiger Global among its backers, is looking to do an IPO later this year after the planned public debut of Ola Electric, a startup that was spun out of Ola. Both startups were founded by Aggarwal, who has since also founded the AI startup Krutrim, which became a unicorn in January. Ola Electric is seeking to raise more than $650 million in its IPO, according to paperwork filed by the firm. Heres Aggarwals Monday email to staff in its entirety: Dear All, In line with our vision to serve 1 Billion Indians, and our commitment to drive sustainable growth and enhance efficiency across the organization, we are undergoing a restructuring exercise aimed at improving profitability and preparing ourselves for the next phase of growth. We have made substantial investments in areas of AI &amp; Technology which has led to significant cost advantages and we will continue to focus on these areas to ensure that we build cutting edge products and services across our business verticals. These changes will result in certain roles within the company becoming redundant. This decision was not made lightly, and we are committed to supporting those impacted during this transition period. Hemant will be stepping down from his role as CEO to pursue opportunities outside the company. We extend our gratitude to Hemant for his contributions and wish him the best in his future endeavors. I am very confident of the strong leadership team which we have built over the last few years at Ola Consumer, who bring in a lot of experience and expertise to their respective roles. They will collaborate closely with me to drive technology-led growth. We are committed to transparency and open communication throughout this process. Our HR team would be available to address any queries or concerns you may have. Thank you for your unwavering dedication and commitment to Ola. Best, Bhavish",

        "Extracted Article": "Space and defense startup True Anomaly has laid off around 25% of its workforce and canceled its summer internship program, TechCrunch has learned. “With our rapid growth over the past two years, we looked at every aspect of our company to make sure we are laser focused on our goals and best positioned to execute,” a company spokesperson said. “We identified the duplication of roles and functions across the company, and as such, reduced our headcount. This won’t impact our ability to execute on our contracts with customers or on our mission to bring security and sustainability to the space domain.” While TechCrunch could not confirm the total headcount prior to these layoffs, True Anomaly had over 100 employees as of December 2023, it told the Denver Business Journal. Nearly 30 people were cut from the workforce, according to a post on LinkedIn from one of the people let go. Employees started posting on LinkedIn about the layoffs on April 24; according to those messages, people impacted worked in sales, business development and recruiting. At least some interns were abruptly told the summer internship program was canceled last Friday, on April 19, as well. The internship was set to start on June 1. The Centennial, Colorado-based startup closed a $100 million financing round last December; at the time, executives said staff had swelled to 107 employees. Earlier this month, True Anomaly CEO Even Rogers told TechCrunch during an interview on the company’s first mission that the company was “well-capitalized.” True Anomaly hopes to modernize space defense with its Jackal spacecraft and Mosaic software platform for command and control operations. The startup envisions using Jackals on orbit to approach, image and gather intelligence on other objects in orbit. True Anomaly launched that first mission, called Mission X, on March 4, though it ended early after the company failed to establish reliable communications with the two spacecraft that were deployed in orbit. The anomaly is hardly slowing them down, however. The startup is pushing to launch at least twice more in the next 12 months, aiming for another launch in October, one person told TechCrunch. The person was offered an internship, and spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, saying that a technical recruiter suggested that the internship program had been canceled because the company didn’t have the human bandwidth to organize and supervise an intern project. The team is also starting work on the $30 million responsive space contract that the company was awarded earlier this month, the person said.",

The company said people who were laid off worked across various functions; according to employees posting on LinkedIn, some were engineers. Before the layoffs, Hinge had more than 1,700 employees, according to a LinkedIn estimate. “As we continue to reimagine musculoskeletal care, we are also committed to building a long-term sustainable business, a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The layoffs come as the company prepares for an IPO and aims to reach profitability. The company didn’t comment on the timing for its IPO, but Hinge has said previously that it is not under pressure to hit the public markets this year since it still has $400 million of cash on its balance sheet. Hinge was last valued at $6.2 billion in October 2021 when it raised a $400 Series E from Tiger Global and Coatue Management.

        "Extracted Article": "Agility Robotics on Thursday confirmed that it has laid off a “small number” of employees. The well-funded Oregon-based firm says the job loss is part of a company-wide focus on commercialization efforts. “As part of Agility’s ongoing efforts to structure the company for success, we have parted ways with a small number of employees that were not central to core product development and commercialization,” the company wrote in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “At the same time, we are focused on meeting the extraordinary demand for bipedal robots across industrial use cases. That means ramping up production of Digit while continuing to win top-tier global customers, and adding new roles that meet these goals. We believe today’s actions will allow us to focus on the areas that drive productization, commercialization, and production of Digit.” Agility was ahead of the industrial humanoid curve with its bipedal robot, Digit. The firm was spun out of research conducted at Oregon State University. There’s been no lack of interest in its impressive legged robots over the years. Ford was an early champion, as Agility explored Digit’s last-mile-delivery potential. Ultimately, however, those efforts were placed on the back burner, as the company shifted focus to understaffed warehouses. There’s been no lack of funding for Agility’s efforts, despite a general slowdown in investments in and adoption of robotic systems, both of which can be seen as corrections following a massive pandemic-fueled boom. Two years ago this month, the company announced a $150 million Series B. Amazon notably participated in the round by way of its Industrial Innovation Fund. The retail giant subsequently announced that it would pilot Digits as part of its fulfillment center workflow. The pilots have since ended, but neither company has announced next steps. A number of other humanoid robotics firms have announced their own pilots in recent months, including Figure with BMW and Apptronik with Mercedes. Last month at Modex, Agility showcased updates to Digit’s end effectors designed specifically for automotive manufacturing workflows. Agility has also made a number of high-profile hires over the past year, including Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson joining as chief executive, Fetch CEO Melonee Wise as CTO and former Apple and Ford executive Aindrea Campbell in as COO. The company’s jobs page currently lists five open roles, largely focused on engineering and manufacturing.",

        "Extracted Article": "ChowNow, the online ordering platform and marketing service for local restaurants, acquired Cuboh, a Y Combinator-backed point-of-sale (POS) platform that consolidates all orders from delivery apps into one place. This marks ChowNow’s first acquisition, which will help strengthen its POS integration solution and help restaurants tackle orders across multiple services. However, as part of the acquisition, ChowNow laid off around 30 employees, bringing the total workforce to 300. Meanwhile, Cuboh’s entire 30-person team — including marketing, sales, product and engineering — is transitioning to ChowNow. “We unfortunately did do a little bit of a layoff as part of the restructuring to best position us,” ChowNow co-founder and CEO Chris Webb told TechCrunch. This comes after the company laid off 100 people in 2022. Webb later told TechCrunch that 60 people were laid off, but that 30 people joined through Cuboh, resulting in a net loss of 30 employees. He also said no further layfoffs were planned. The financial terms of the deal werent disclosed. Signaling tough times ahead, ChowNow lays off employees Launched in 2012, ChowNow connects customers with local restaurants and helps businesses establish an online presence by providing custom online ordering systems and marketing support. It also offers a dispatch system that pairs restaurants with delivery drivers. It doesn’t charge any commission fees like its competitors, and it allows restaurants to keep 100% of their profits. ChowNow considers over 20,000 small restaurants as customers and has helped process more than 250 million online orders. The company says its saved restaurants $700 million in commission fees. ChowNow is a profitable company and has raised around $80 million to date, Webb said. Cuboh is a notable addition to the company. Previously, ChowNow’s dashboard could only manage a restaurant’s in-house menu. Now restaurants no longer have to manually manage all their menus, mitigating the potential for errors and overall mayhem in the kitchen. Menus can be updated across all delivery apps to reflect out-of-stock items and price increases, among other changes. Starting next week, restaurant owners can access a newly launched bundle, “ChowNow + Cuboh,” for $275 per month. The bundle combines ChowNow Pro ($199), the companys flagship product that handles all ordering, marketing and operations, and Cuboh’s POS solution, which ranges from $100 to $200 a month. And while ChowNow’s platform already integrates into over 30 POS systems, Cuboh is delivering 14 additional integrations to the table, such as Clover, Lightspeed, Brink, Micros, Revel, POSitouch, Square, Par, Dinerware, Aloha and more. In the future, ChowNow wants to build more integrations, such as one for catering services. “Its getting back to the longer-term product vision of what were building, of being the only platform restaurants need for their entire takeout business,” Webb said.

        "Extracted Article": "Banking-as-a-service startup (BaaS) Synctera has conducted a restructuring that has resulted in a staff reduction, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. While Synctera did not share how many employees were impacted, a report in Fintech Business Weekly pegs the number to be about 17 people, or about 15% of the company. Doing the math, that means the company had about 113 employees prior to the cuts, and about 96 now. Synctera built a platform designed to bring together fintech companies and sponsor banks. It recently announced an $18.6 million extension round to its $15 million Series A, which was announced in March of 2023. At that time, it also announced the hiring of Leigh Gross as its new chief revenue officer and BTG Pactual and Flutterwave as customers. Investors include NAventures, the corporate venture arm of National Bank of Canada; Lightspeed Venture Partners; Fin Capital; Banco Popular; and Mana Ventures. When asked about the job cuts, a company spokesperson wrote via email: “Synctera has conducted a restructuring of the company that resulted in a reduction in staff and we are dedicated to assisting those who are impacted. We are committed to our current line of business along with the addition of SaaS offerings for banks and companies.” The startup is not the only VC-backed BaaS company to have resorted to layoffs to preserve cash recently. Treasury Prime slashed half its 100-person staff in February, a year after it announced a $40 million Series C raise. And last October, Andreessen Horowitz-backed Synapse confirmed that it had laid off 86 people, or about 40% of the company. Figure Technologies, which includes Figure Pay, laid off 90 people — or about 20% of its workforce — last July. Meanwhile, Piermont Bank reportedly cut ties with startup Unit, Fintech Business Weekly reported. BaaS refers to various types of business models such as offering bank-like services to other players in the industry; or providing the charter and bank services but not doing the underwriting; or offering banking components, which is more of a fintech that isn’t a bank but provides some bank-like services without a charter. Players in BaaS have faced challenges, especially regulatory crackdowns in 2023. For instance, those providing BaaS to fintech partners accounted for more than 13% of severe enforcement actions from federal bank regulators last year, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports. Unfortunately, startups navigating those challenges may need to resort to more layoffs to keep up. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.

        "Extracted Article": "Phantom Auto, a remote driving startup that launched seven years ago amid the buzz of autonomous vehicle technology, is shutting down after failing to secure new funding, TechCrunch has learned. The company, which had raised a total of $95 million, developed a teleoperation platform that allowed a remote driver, sometimes located thousands of miles away, to operate a vehicle if needed. The company attracted a mix of backers, including angel investors and early-stage VCs such as Bessemer Venture Partners and Maniv Mobility, private equity firm InfraBridge and strategic investors such as ArcBest and ConGlobal. The startups last raise was $25 million in 2023. The startup had come close to securing another round of funding, but it fell through unexpectedly, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. At its height, the startup employed about 120 people. Phantom Auto, which had cut staff last year, employed a little more than 100 people as of this week. It was based in South San Francisco. Phantom Autos demise is the latest in a long line of startups that popped up as the autonomous vehicle technology industry gained attention and investment from investors. That buzz, which led to billion-dollar acquisitions and valuations in the industry, faded as optimistic timelines to deploy robotaxis and self-driving vehicles slipped. A wave of consolidation, shutdowns and pivots followed. The difficult fundraising environment in the past 18 months caused another wave of closures. Phantom Auto founder and CEO Shai Magzimof posted Tuesday on LinkedIn that the company was ceasing operations. After seven years of efforts to reshape the future of physical labor at Phantom Auto, weve made the tough decision to close operations. there are various factors contributing to this, including market conditions and insufficient funding, he wrote. I express gratitude to our employees, investors, customers, partners, and all whove joined us on this journey. these times are challenging, but my primary concern is our team. We possess exceptional talent now seeking opportunities in the job market. Im committed to providing references for our employees. personally, Ill be taking a pause to unwind and think about the next steps. Sources told TechCrunch that the company had traction on the customer deployment side. However, it was still reliant on external funding to keep operations going and eventually to scale. Phantom Auto was founded in 2017 and initially focused on applying its teleops technology to autonomous vehicles on public roadways such as robotaxis and self-driving trucks. The companys executive team soon realized that even with its technology, large-scale commercial deployments of driverless vehicles on public roads was decades away. Phantom Auto pivoted in 2019 and started shopping its remote driving system to logistics, specifically forklifts and yard trucks that have no autonomy as well as autonomous sidewalk delivery robots. All of these vehicles operate at low speed and, with the exception of delivery bots, are in confined environments. The company had customer agreements with Maersk, CJ Logistics, ArcBest and autonomous sidewalk bot startup Serve Robotics.",

        "Extracted Article": "Yet another AI-powered fraud detection software provider is laying off staff. Inscribe, whose platform works to detect fraud in areas like business underwriting, tenant screening and onboarding, has cut just under 40% of its staff, which equates to dozens of employees. The news follows that of another small round of layoffs at AI-powered plagiarism detector Turnitin, whose CEO had last year touted how AI would enable the company to reduce its headcount. According to sources, Inscribes board recommended the cuts as the current market caused the startup to miss its revenue goals for over a year. San Francisco-based Inscribe.ai confirmed the headcount reduction to TechCrunch, noting that the AI advances in the financial services industry necessitated a pivot to a new product and direction for the company. 2023 was a year of change for our customers and Inscribe, explained Inscribe CEO and co-founder, Ronan Burke. Many of our customers in the fintech industry had to contend with higher interest rates and an unpredictable future for consumers and businesses. Additionally, the advances in AI in 2023 present one of the largest opportunities for the financial services ecosystem — enabling improved customer experiences, more efficient processes and fairer decisions, he continued. In Q4 of last year, we set out on a new product strategy to align with these two industry shifts, and we have a large product launch planned for later this year related to this, which we are very excited about. As part of the change in strategy, in January of this year, we made the difficult decision to reduce the size of the team by just under 40%, mostly in go-to-market and operational roles, Burke said. The company was already a relatively small operation, with 60 (or more) employees, according to LinkedIn and PitchBook, a mix of engineering, product design, AI expertise, marketing, sales and more. In January 2023, Inscribe raised $25 million in Series B funding led by Threshold Ventures with participation from Crosslink Capital, Foundry, Uncork Capital, Box co-founder Dillon Smith and Intercom co-founder Des Traynor. The round brought Inscribes total raise to date to $38 million. At the time, the company forecast it would double its then 50-person workforce over the coming 12 to 18 months.

Turnitin, a plagiarism detection company whose CEO Chris Caren last year warned that, in 18 months, his company would be able to reduce 20% of its headcount thanks to AI, is today confirming a small set of layoffs. TechCrunch learned that Turnitin laid off around 15 people earlier this year, as part of broader organizational changes. While thats nowhere near the 20% reduction Caren had forecast Turnitin has more than 900 employees, per LinkedIn and PitchBook data its a set of layoffs were particularly interested in, given Carens earlier comments. Speaking at an event in 2023, he noted that Turnitin had a few hundred engineers, but he believed that in 18 months, we will need 20% of those number of people, referring to the engineering staff. And well be able to start hiring a lot of them out of high school versus four-year colleges probably the same for sales and marketing functions, he added. His comments were made during a discussion about how AI would impact the job market by increasing efficiencies. Turnitins software leverages machine learning and AI to detect if a students writing is plagiarized. It sells to schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions and works with partners like Coursera, Blackboard and others. Already, there are some signs that AI is replacing workers. Klarna recently announced that its AI Assistant can do the job of 700 workers, shocking the industry. Turnitin confirmed its layoffs in a statement to TechCrunch, but not the headcount: After careful consideration, late last year, we communicated to our global team our decision to make organizational changes to evolve our business strategy, streamline processes, enhance customer focus and support Turnitins continued growth. With gratitude for their contributions, Turnitin provided transitional support to impacted team members. Out of respect for their privacy, we decline to comment further on this internal matter.

        "Extracted Article": "Web3-enabled fantasy sports platform Sorare laid off 22 employees based in its New York office in February. The move comes as the startup wants certain teams to be concentrated at the companys Paris headquarters to improve communication and efficiency, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. As we plan for our next stage of growth, Sorare has made the decision to centralize some of our functions at our Paris HQ, Nicolas Julia, the co-founder and CEO of Sorare, told TechCrunch through email. This primarily affects our product development team as we believe that bringing that team together in the same space in Paris will allow them to collaborate more effectively as they continue to build best in class products across our football, baseball and basketball offerings. An additional 11 employees in the New York office were asked to relocate to Paris, a source familiar with the matter said. The company will backfill most of these laid-off roles in Paris, according to Julia, with plans to hire more than 20 roles in the next six months. Sorare is not shutting down its New York office. It will keep certain teams there like those that work with U.S. customers or on its U.S. brand partnerships with leagues like the MLB and NBA, according to Julia. Sorares partnerships with these sports leagues are locked in for several years, a source added. While a source familiar with the matter said that these layoffs were not financially driven, the source did add that like many other web3 companies, the time horizon for how long it will take Sorare to reach its growth goals is longer than it originally thought. Sorare’s users can buy and sell NFT cards from other players on its platforms, although Sorare primarily makes its money by issuing and selling new cards. Sorare saw $200 million in user transaction volume in 2023, a source familiar with the situation said. The company declined to say if it was profitable or what runway it had left. Sorare hasnt raised capital since its $680 million Series B round in 2021, which valued the company at $4 billion. According to secondary data platforms, Sorare hasnt been garnering much interest from investors there. To be fair, the declining interest isn’t strictly an issue for Sorare — web3 companies have largely fallen out of favor with investors. Startups in the category raised $7 billion in 2023, according to Crunchbase data, a drop of 74% from 2022s $26 billion. For context, overall venture funding dropped 38% in the same timeframe. Web3 companies focused on gaming have struggled to find meaningful traction. Last month, video game–focused VCs told TechCrunch that the market for web3 games turned out to be significantly smaller than some investors had hoped. This has become evident. Mythical Games, a web3 gaming startup, raised nearly $300 million in venture money before holding three rounds of layoffs. Dapper Labs, another startup in the category, has also held numerous rounds of layoffs. This is not to say Sorare will see the same fate. The company has an active community of nearly 13,000 people on Reddit posting regularly about the fantasy games and a community of third-party media dedicated to these competitions. Hopefully, even if the web3 winter continues, Sorares reorg will be enough.",

        "Extracted Article": "Electric vehicle startup Fisker is planning to lay off 15% of its workforce and says it likely does not have enough cash on hand to survive the next 12 months. The company says it is trying to find a way to raise that money as it works through a pivot from direct sales to a dealership model. [W]e have put a plan in place to streamline the company as we prepare for another difficult year, founder and CEO Henrik Fisker said in a statement. Fisker reported more than 1,300 employees as of the end of September 2023, meaning the cut could affect close to 200 people. The companys share price plunged 35% in after-hours trading. Fisker said Thursday that it finished 2023 with $396 million in cash, though $70 million of that is restricted. The company says it is talking with one of its lenders about making an additional investment in the company. It also claims it is in negotiations with a large automaker for a potential transaction which could include an investment in Fisker, joint development of one or more electric vehicle platforms, and North America manufacturing. A partnership like that will be crucial, as Fisker executives said on a call Thursday that it wont invest any more money in its future products unless it works with another automaker. That means the fates of a pickup truck, compact EV and other models that Fisker has teased are now in question. The companys financial struggles come as it is trying to move to a wholesale model built around partnerships with dealers, a shift that Fisker says has negatively impacted its sales so far. Its currently sitting on inventory of thousands of vehicles that are collectively worth more than $500 million. Fisker says it has received interest from around 250 dealerships but has only signed up 13 to date. Fisker has also been dealing with a number of problems with its Ocean SUV, its only model so far, as TechCrunch reported earlier this month. The company has said it resolved some issues with a software update in December and planned to fix many more in a larger 2.0 update earlier this month, but that only started making its way to customer vehicles this week. It is currently being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for reports of sudden brake failure, as well as for a handful of vehicle rollaway incidents. Fisker Ocean owners flagged sudden power loss and brake problems for months, internal documents show A number of big automakers are pulling back on their aggressive EV targets, and newer players are having trouble as well. Rivian recently announced it was cutting 10% of its workforce and that it expects to make around the same number of EVs this year as it did in 2023. Lucid Motors plans to build around 9,000 vehicles this year after once predicting it would be building 90,000 by this point in time. Fisker has always differentiated itself from other EV startups, though, as it pursued an asset light business model. It designed the Ocean but outsourced the manufacturing to Magna Steyr in Austria. That decision helped it get cars on the road faster than some other startups, though it has imperiled the company in other ways. For instance, its Ocean SUV isnt eligible for the point-of-sale federal EV tax credit because the vehicle isnt manufactured in North America. Ultimately, Fisker said Thursday that it sold just shy of 5,000 Ocean SUVs in 2023 and generated $273 million of revenue, after starting shipments in earnest in June. It lost just shy of $761 million across the full year. Magna produced just over 10,000 Oceans, and Fisker said it hopes to start shipping those to its new dealer partners in order to generate near-term cash. The company declined to say on the conference call how many vehicles its initial partners have ordered or plan to order. Like many other EV startups that went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, Fisker has had a lot of growing pains as a public company. It had to delay the release of its third quarter 2023 financial results in part because it found weaknesses in its internal financial reporting. Around that time, it also had two different chief accounting officers resign. These problems continued Thursday, as Fisker said it will be late reporting its full 2023 financial results. It also revealed it has discovered another material weakness related to its revenue and the related balance sheet accounts. As a result, it couched the financial figures it released Thursday as preliminary, going so far as to append an asterisk to the headline of the press release.",

        "Extracted Article": "Motional, the autonomous vehicle company born out of a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, told employees Wednesday it will cut about 5% of its workforce, TechCrunch has learned. The cuts, which translate to fewer than 70 people, mostly affect administrative roles and some employees working in Boston, one of several cities where it tests autonomous vehicles, according to sources who asked to not be named because they are not authorized to speak for Motional. The autonomous vehicle company last had layoffs in December 2022, when it cut about 10% of its workforce. That earlier layoff mostly affected the companys operations in Pittsburgh, where it tests AVs. Motional operates an autonomous vehicle taxi service in Las Vegas (still with human safety operators behind the wheel) on Uber, Lyft and Via platforms. It also has an autonomous delivery pilot with Uber Eats in Santa Monica, California. A Motional spokesperson confirmed the layoffs. Motional recently announced steps to reallocate resources to areas of the company that will directly enable long-term commercial success, including staff reductions that impacted less than 5% of employees working in non-technical roles, Motional said in an emailed statement. We are continuing to hire critical talent needed to develop our technology and meet our commercial goals. We’re confident in our funding roadmap and are well positioned for the next phase of our commercialization. Our team is focused on scaling our driverless services, expanding Motional’s commercial partnerships, and furthering development on Motional’s next-generation robotaxi in collaboration with Kia. The layoffs come one month after automotive supplier Aptiv — the other half of a $4 billion joint venture with Hyundai that created Motional — said it would no longer allocate capital toward the endeavor. With Aptiv pulling out of future funding, Hyundai is left as the sole backer, unless Motional is able to court another company to fund its efforts. Motional is also exploring outside funding deals, according to one source. The company has previously said in internal meetings that it had enough runway to last through the end of Q1 2024. Despite its financial woes, the company has continued to make some progress toward its goal of launching a robotaxi service using driverless Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles in 2024. In November, Hyundai Motor Group and Motional announced plans to co-develop production-ready versions of the all-electric Ioniq 5 robotaxi at the automaker’s new innovation center in Singapore, the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore (HMGICS). A production-ready autonomous vehicle, equipped with the kind of redundancies designed for safe operations without a human driver, is a critical milestone required for commercial operations. During CES 2024, the company announced plans to work with Kia on a next-generation vehicle that will enter commercial operations later this decade. The initial development process will begin this year, according to the company.",

        "Extracted Article": "Apple is scuttling its secretive, long-running effort to build an autonomous electric car, executives announced in a short meeting with the team Tuesday morning. The company is likely cutting hundreds of employees from the team and all work on the project has stopped, TechCrunch has learned. Some remaining employees will be shifted to Apples generative AI projects, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the projects cancellation. Others will have 90 days to find a reassignment to other roles inside the company, or they will be let go. The car project still had around 1,400 employees working on it, according to one employee who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about their work. The decision to kill the project comes at a time when major automakers are reevaluating their investments in electric vehicles, and amid increased scrutiny on autonomous vehicle projects. Apples entry into the automotive sector was also seen as a possible boon to its bottom line, giving it a new source of revenue to help bolster against stagnating hardware sales and regulatory threats to its services business. Apple declined to comment. Apple first started working on its car project, known internally as Project Titan, in 2014. At one point, it had around 5,000 workers dedicated to the effort. But Apple pivoted repeatedly over the last decade, oscillating between an emphasis on making an all-electric Tesla competitor and a fully autonomous vehicle more akin to what Waymo has created. Most recently, Bloomberg reported in January that the projects leadership was under pressure from Apples top executives and its board to find a way to bring something to market sooner than later. Apples chief operating officer Jeff Williams and the vice president in charge of Titan, Kevin Lynch, announced the news to the team Tuesday in a short meeting that lasted about 12 minutes, and did not take questions, according to the employee. While this person described the announcement as abrupt, they said the decision was not, citing the constantly shifting priorities. A number of high-profile automotive executives cycled through Project Titan over the years. Most notably, the project was once run by former Tesla executive Doug Field (who eventually left to take a role at Ford). Apple also poached executives from Lamborghini and Ford. In 2021, it hired Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive who helped run the i3 program, away from EV startup Canoo. Apple once even held talks with Canoo as it searched the market for contract manufacturing partners, intellectual property, and talent. That search also included talks with Hyundai and Kia.",

        "Extracted Article": "Rivian is laying off 10% of its salaried workforce in a bid to cut costs in an increasingly tough market for electric vehicles, putting even more pressure on its future, more affordable EV called the R2. A limited number of non-manufacturing hourly employees will also be cut, founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in a companywide email. This is the third round of layoffs for the EV company since July 2022, when Rivian cut 6% of its workforce. The company cut another 6% of jobs in February 2023. The company more than doubled the number of EVs it built and shipped in 2023 compared to 2022. But Rivian still lost more than $5.4 billion for the year, and announced Wednesday that it only expects to build the same amount 57,000 of electric vehicles across all of 2024. Rivian said it plans to shut down its sole factory in Normal, Illinois midyear to upgrade its manufacturing line with an expectation to improve production rates by about 30%. As a result, Rivian says it expects to lose, on an adjusted basis, around $2.7 billion in 2024, and has decided to continue its company-wide cost transformation program. That includes changes to the design and engineering of its vehicles, making manufacturing more efficient, and laying off more employees. The company said it expects capital expenditures to reach $1.75 billion in 2024— an uptick from the $1.03 billion it spent last year that will be driven by additional investment in its next-generation technologies, its future Georgia factory and go-to-market operations. The companys production and profit loss guidance combined with the layoffs pushed Rivian shares down more than 15.6% in after-hours trading. Our business is facing a challenging macroeconomic environment including historically high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty and we need to make purposeful changes now to ensure our promising future, Scaringe said in an email to the company. We must strategically prioritize our growth areas of the business, including the launch of Peregrine and R2 as well as investing in our go-to-market capabilities. Rivian reported Wednesday fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion, more than double the $663 million it generated in the same period of 2022. On a full-year basis, Rivian reported revenue of $4.4 billion, up from $1.66 billion in 2022. The majority of revenue came from the sale of its EVs. It brought in about $39 million in the fourth quarter and $73 million for the full year from the sale of regulatory credits. The company reported a net loss of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement over the $1.72 billion loss it reported in Q4 2022. On an adjusted basis, it reported a loss of $1.1 billion compared to a $1.5 billion loss in the same year-ago period. Rivian, which makes an all-electric pickup truck, SUV and a commercial van, has made progress on its loss per vehicle. Although it still has a considerable way to go before it gets close to break even. The company reported it lost $43,372 per unit delivered in the fourth quarter, a more than two-thirds improvement from the $124,162 it lost per unit in Q4 2022. We took significant steps towards driving greater efficiency in 2023 gross profit per vehicle improved by approximately $81,000 when comparing the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter 2022, Scaringe said on an earnings call Wednesday. As we start 2024, I want to emphasize our teams continued sense of urgency and ownership mindset and driving further efficiency throughout the organization.",

        "Extracted Article": "After naming Phil Graves the chief financial officer of alternative protein maker Meati Foods at the beginning of February, he is now the company’s new chief executive officer. Co-founder Tyler Huggins will transition into the role of chief innovation officer, where he will oversee the company’s brand refocus as Meati, maker of alternative protein cutlets and steaks from mycelium, or mushroom root, rolls out more of its MushroomRoot product in 2024. The company also said it was reducing its workforce by 13% as Meati works to “build a financially sustainable business,” Graves told TechCrunch exclusively. “To do that, you have to have the right organizational structure and team in place,” Graves said. “Its hard to build something that is entirely new, so we are having a reduction in force. While its painful for all involved its also imperative that we as a business have a clear path to financial profitability.” The company did not disclose how many jobs that entailed. Meati said it had as many as 150 employees in 2022. Severance packages were still being decided at the time of publication. Meati Foods sinks teeth into $150M to expand its mushroom-root meat operations Meati is another example of a tech company making layoffs that didn’t appear to be in trouble. Meati’s Mega Ranch facility scaled production throughout 2023. Products are now in more than 3,600 retail locations nationwide, including Whole Foods Market, Meijer, Cub Foods and Sprouts Farmers Market. Graves even said the company has a goal of expanding that to 10,000 locations before the end of 2024. Mushrooms are big at the moment, too. Companies are turning fungi into functional beverages and leather-like materials, which has resulted in companies gaining success — and venture capital funding — for doing nothing more than growing more mushrooms. Meati itself benefited from investor attention. The company raised significant venture capital in the past two years, most recently at the Series C level. An initial $150 million was announced in July 2022, and that round took in another $22 million in January 2023 before ultimately closing at over $200 million later on in 2023. Much of that was invested in the 100,000-square-foot “Mega Ranch” facility that enabled Meati to produce an annual rate of tens of millions of pounds of its protein. Once fully ramped up, the facility will have the capability of producing more than 45 million pounds of product, Huggins told TechCrunch at the time. Spacegoods shakes up functional beverage industry with mushroom-based powders “Production is ramping up as expected; however, the days where companies can raise unlimited capital and defer profitability for decades are gone,” Graves said. “One of the main things that I am laser-focused on, and the team is as well, is showcasing a clear path to profitability in the next 12 months. We aim to be EBITDA positive, and we have a path to get there. Our ceiling is as high as its ever been with these changes.” Meanwhile, Graves joined Meati this month from Wild Idea Buffalo Co., a company focused on sustainable meat production, where he served as the CEO for nearly two years. He also previously worked at Bass Pro Shops and Patagonia, where he was the founder of its corporate venture fund, Tin Shed Ventures. “Phil is undoubtedly the right person to lead the company forward while I focus on delivering the product and brand that will establish Meati’s long-term legacy,” Huggins said in a statement. “We are coming significantly closer to fulfilling the reason Meati was founded — to elevate the health of people and the planet with the boundless potential of nature.” Startups, heres how you can make hardware without ruining the planet",

        "Extracted Article": "Getaround, a company that helps vehicle owners rent out their cars, trucks and SUVs to other peers, is cutting 30% of its North American workforce as part of a restructuring. The company said in a statement it will restructure its workforce and operations to reduce costs in hopes of extending its cash runway and accelerating its path to profitability. Getaround wouldnt disclose the number of workers it currently employs in North America or in Europe, where it also operates. The company employed 283 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022, according to its most recent full-year earnings report. That figure has fluctuated since then due to a 10% workforce reduction in February 2023, which was also conducted to achieve a leaner path to profitability, and an acquisition of Hyrecar in May 2023. Getaround said this latest restructuring will result in savings of about $7 million on an annualized run-rate basis. The company said it expects up to $1 million in restructuring costs in connection with the workforce reductions. Our focus on profitability and sustainable business growth necessitated this difficult workforce reduction program, Getaround CEO Sam Zaid said in a statement. Weve made significant progress over the past year, including steady improvements in revenue growth and unit economics, as well as in overall adjusted EBITDA profile and operating efficiency. We launched a new artificial intelligence model (Trustscore AI) to improve the safety and economics of our marketplace, deployed a powerful new global app that unifies and enables seamless trip coordination across the U.S. and Europe, and expanded to gig carsharing, enabling gig workers across the U.S. to rent cars to drive for services like Uber and DoorDash. As the only truly global and digital carsharing marketplace, and as the leader in gig carsharing, we believe Getaround is increasingly well positioned for the future. Getaround has seen revenue growth, according to its third-quarter earnings report which revealed a 42% year-over-year increase. While progress has been made, profitability is still a ways off. In that same quarter, Getaround reported $42.9 million worth of operating expenses and a $27.3 million loss on a net GAAP basis. Even when using more generous profit calculations, Getaround was still unprofitable in the third quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA of -$11.3 million during the three-month period.",

The Swedish company was in the middle of a funding round, just prior to the filing, but apparently the withdrawal of an investor was what tipped the company over the edge, according to Swedish media reports. Ytterborn declined to comment on what will happen next. While its unclear if Cake filed for bankruptcy protection or insolvency, Ytterborn did tell media outlet Dagens Industri that he had nothing else in mind but to find a solution in one format or another. His comments suggest the company filed for protection. Best known for making high-design bikes, Cake raised a $14 million Series A in 2019. It followed that with a $60 million Series B round in 2021 led by Swedish pension fund AMF. The capital was meant to fund manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia and to scale up its retail capabilities, the company said at the time. Cake has struggled as of late, though. In November, it issued a recall for one of its mopeds because of a risk that the steering column could break. Just a few weeks later, it recalled its flagship Kalk e-motorcycle after a unit caught fire in a South Korean dealership. Ytterborn confirmed last week to Swedish outlet Breakit that the company wasnt going to be able to make salary payments to employees. Cakes struggles are just the latest in the wider world of e-mobility. Superpedestrian went out of business and Bird filed for bankruptcy. Micromobility.com formerly known as Helbiz was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange. Tier and Dott decided to merge in order to find a better path forward. Perhaps most relevant to Cake, though, is the case of Vanmoof. The high-end e-bike maker out of the Netherlands filed for bankruptcy protection last year. But it was able to find a buyer in electric scooter company Lavoie that has since gotten the brand back up and running.",

        "Extracted Article": "Despite record growth in the solar industry last year, software startup Aurora Solar has laid off 20% of its staff of about 500 people, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The company, which provides software to help solar installers manage their sales, project design and installation process, has missed its growth targets for the past year, a source said. Monday’s layoffs follow a smaller layoff of around 20 people in November, they added. Aurora Solar last raised $200 million in a Series D round that closed in February 2022, less than nine months after raising a $250 million Series C. In total, the company has raised $523 million, according to PitchBook. Like many other companies in the solar industry, we’ve felt the effects of larger macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates and the impact of NEM 3.0 in California, Aurora Solar told TechCrunch after publication. In California, the largest solar market in the U.S., changes in net metering (known as NEM 3.0) have led to homeowners getting paid about 75% less for power sold back to utilities. While that hasn’t cratered demand for solar among single-family homeowners, it’s possible the new regulations knocked it off its previous trajectory. The net metering changes generated a surge of interest last year, according to Aurora Solar’s data, likely from homeowners hoping to get in before the new rules took effect. With net metering rates slashed, the state has decided to offer richer incentives for solar installations that include batteries. But many door-to-door sales representatives, especially those who work independently, aren’t as well equipped to sell batteries since they require far more details about a home than solar alone. To design and permit a battery system, sales reps have to calculate the household’s daily energy usage, size up the home’s electrical panel and figure out where to put the batteries. Solar, on the other hand, can often be sold by looking at satellite photos of a home’s roof and surrounding trees and buildings, from which software can easily calculate how much power a solar array can produce. https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/tech-layoffs-2023-list/ As a result, smaller installers have been facing pressure under the new regime. While Aurora Solar says its software is used by 90% of the top 100 solar installers, it also has more than 7,000 customers, many of which likely fall in the long tail of the distribution, those that say they’re under the most pressure. In total, the California solar industry was estimated to cut 17,000 jobs last year. This article has been updated with comment from Aurora Solar.",

The move is part of the companys restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs as its LA-based parent company seeks to improve its finances ahead of an initial public offering in the U.S. as early as 2025, a source familiar with the situation said. Webtoon Entertainment has three storytelling subsidiaries: Wattpad in Toronto, Naver Webtoon in Seoul and Line Digital Frontier in Tokyo. This is the companys second round of layoffs. Wattpad laid off 42 of its 267 workforce, or 15% of the staff, in March 2023. Earlier this week, local media outlets, including The Korea Economic Daily, reported that the cut impacted about 30 employees, or roughly 15% of its workforce. Last October, Wattpad launched a new freemium model, Wattpad Originals, allowing writers to hide certain chapters behind a paywall and allowing readers to access free content and try before they buy. Most recently, the company began offering Premium Picks, which gives Premium and Premium+ subscribers monthly access to five free Wattpad Originals.

        "Extracted Article": "Indian food delivery startup Swiggy is cutting about 400 jobs, or nearly 7% of its workforce, as the startup seeks to bring further improvements to its finances ahead of a planned IPO later this year. This is the second round of layoffs at the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which cut just as many jobs early last year. The move comes as Swiggy attempts to further improve its finances. Though its food delivery business has been profitable for several quarters, the startup is not profitable at a group level. Zomato, Swiggys chief rival, became profitable last year. Investment bankers and mutual fund investors hold the view that Swiggy, valued at $10.7 billion in its most recent funding round, will be very closely compared to Zomato by retail investors at the time of listing and needs to beat the older rival on many metrics if it desires a good valuation. Swiggy didnt respond to a request for comment. Indian newspaper ET first reported the layoff. Zomato and Swiggy lead the Indian food delivery market, but in recent quarters Zomato has expanded its market share lead, according to UBS and AllianceBernstein. Zomato held over 60% of the Indian food delivery market, based on app user count, AllianceBernstein said in a note Wednesday. Data/Image Credits: AllianceBernstein Post covid, Zomato has grown faster than Swiggy — both from a user base &amp; GMV perspective driven by strong execution, wider penetration (Zomato is present in 750+ cities as compared to ~600 cities for Swiggy) and stronger content funnel, AllianceBernstein analysts wrote. In the past three months, Zomato has incrementally gained ~100bps in market share in terms of monthly active users (MAUs). From a GMV perspective, Zomato holds ~54% share in food delivery as compared to Swiggy at 46% as of 1HCY23, Zomato’s food delivery GMV stood at $1.7Bn as compared to Swiggy’s $1.4Bn. Zomato has been a gainer in Tier 2+ cities as well as some Tier 1 cities — which has led to a higher MAU base for Zomato. Zomato had 58Mn annual transacting users in CY22, with food delivery segment exhibiting18.4Mn MTUs in Q2FY24.",

As first reported by The Information, these layoffs came after Veho grew revenue nearly 90% in 2023. “We conducted a reorganization of our corporate team to improve efficiencies, accelerate our path to profitability and be able to invest more in areas that directly impact our clients needs and our growth,” according to a company statement sent to TechCrunch. The logistics technology company, founded in 2016 by Itamar Zur and Fred Cook, is going after the last-mile section of delivery — how packages get from fulfillment centers to the customer’s door. In early 2022, Veho was not in a bad way. The company had grown 40% in revenue and 20% in its customer base from the year prior. There were also plans to jump from 500 employees to 2,000 by the end of 2022. It also was lucky in venture capital during the pandemic as shopping shifted online. At that time, the company raised $170 million in Series B funding in a round, led by Tiger Global Management, that bumped up the company’s valuation to $1.5 billion. Another huge funding round gives Veho room to deliver That was after announcing $125 million in Series A funding two months prior, the round that pushed Veho into unicorn territory. General Catalyst led that round. With now over $300 million in venture-backed funding at its disposal, Veho added markets and brought on a number of executives at the end of 2022, including Eric Swanson as chief commercial officer and Brian McDevitt as chief revenue officer. In the summer of 2023, the company went into 11 New England markets and was working with customers like Kroger, Saks, Nordstrom, Misfits Market, HelloFresh and Nespresso. At that time, Veho said it had 910 employees across corporate and warehouse teams and was looking to fill additional positions. Even with the continued growth, the company wasn’t without problems last year, according to The Information. Those included laying off customer and driver support staff and shifting those jobs overseas. Then Swanson left in March, according to his LinkedIn profile. In December, Veho appointed Deborah Surrette, a former vice president of sales at Oracle, to that role. McDevitt’s social media profiles still say he is CRO, however, The Information reported he left as well. Increased freight rates and consolidation continue to affect the logistics industry, so we’ll have to see what happens. Veho remains optimistic, telling TechCrunch that its capital position “is very strong and we are building on our strong momentum and record peak season in 2023.” Time for moderation?",

        "Extracted Article": "Aurora Innovation, the autonomous vehicle technology company aiming to launch a driverless self-driving trucks business by the end of 2024, laid off dozens of workers this month, according to sources familiar with the action. The Pittsburgh-based company, which also has facilities in California, Colorado, Texas and Montana, has since confirmed that about 3% of its workforce was laid off in the beginning of the year, following an organizational review. Aurora employed about 1,800 workers as of the end of 2023, according to the company. As we move toward commercial launch, we recently reviewed the entire organization to ensure we are working as effectively as possible and with the velocity required to achieve our ambitious goals, according to an emailed statement attributed to Auroras senior vice president of people Cristopher Barrett. Through this process, a limited number of roles were eliminated which impacted 3 percent of our total workforce. During the recent market uncertainty, we have been incredibly thoughtful in our resourcing in order to minimize such actions. We are grateful for the contributions of these individuals and are supporting them through this transition. The layoffs come as Aurora presses forward with plans to deploy a fleet of self-driving trucks that can navigate U.S. highways without a human driver behind the wheel. The company has said it expects to launch up to 20 driverless Class 8 trucks by the end of 2024. Initially, these driverless trucks meaning no human behind the wheel — will carry freight between Dallas and Houston, a route the company has been using for testing. Aurora is also working with automotive supplier Continental on a more than $300 million project to mass produce autonomous vehicle hardware for commercial self-driving trucks. Aurora recently wrapped up the first phase of the project, which allows Continental to work on developing prototypes ahead of its plan to begin production in 2027. Developing autonomous vehicle technology that is safe enough for public roads has proven to be an expensive endeavor that has led to numerous startups shutting down or being acquired. That wave of consolidation kicked off in 2020 and persisted, thanks to economic headwinds, well into 2023. Aurora, which was founded in 2017 by alumni of Tesla, Uber and Waymo, took the path to public markets in a bid to raise the capital needed to commercialize the frontier tech. Aurora became a publicly traded company in 2021 after merging with a special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson. Aurora has emerged as one of the last remaining companies focused on commercializing self-driving big rigs. Kodiak Robotics, which is privately held; Torc Robotics; and Swedens Einride are also working on self-driving trucks. Still, it hasnt always been the smoothest of roads, as the high cost of employing engineers to develop the technology combined with economic headwinds has chipped away at capital. In 2022, a leaked memo sent by Aurora CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson presented a swath of cost-cutting and cash-generating options to its board, ranging from a hiring freeze and spinning out assets to a small capital raise, going private and even selling itself to high-profile tech companies Apple and Microsoft. The company assured investors it had enough money to get to mid-2024, and while some cost reductions were made, real relief came in July 2023 when it completed a capital raise of $820 million from a public and concurrent private offering of its stock. The company said at the time that the stock sale would help fund it through commercial launch at the end of 2024 and “well into 2025. Aurora reiterated its financial position in its third-quarter 2023 earnings report and said it expects its total liquidity of $1.5 billion to support its planned commercial launch and fund operations into the second half of 2025.",

        "Extracted Article": "Expense management startup Brex, which was valued at $12.3 billion two years ago, laid off 282 people, or about 20% of its staff today. The once high-flying fintech startup sent a note to employees (that was also published on the company’s website) today, announcing the news. In addition, Brex announced that its COO, Michael Tannenbaum, is transitioning from his role to become a board member. Camilla Morais, who was SVP of global operations, is being promoted to COO. And Cosmin Nicolaescu is transitioning from his role as CTO to an adviser position this summer. In the note to employees, co-founder and co-CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote that the company was now “emphasizing long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains” in its comp structure. “The opportunity ahead of Brex is massive, and we want everyone staying to have high conviction and financial upside in our equity,” he added. Franceschi also said the company is changing its operating model, expecting leaders to operate at all levels moving forward, promoting from within, increasing in-person collaboration in our hubs, and concentrating the time zones in which we operate. Not its first rodeo In October of 2022, Brex laid off 136 people, or 11% of its staff, across all departments as part of a restructuring. After those layoffs, Brex had just over 1,150 employees. It is not clear how many employees Brex has today, though its layoff indicates the figure at around 1,300 before its previous cuts. The latest layoff news comes amid a report from The Information that the company reportedly told employees that it burned $17 million a month in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that it only had “enough cash to last through March 2026.” A spokesperson for Brex told that publication on Monday that the company’s cash runway is now four years. When asked about financials, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the data was “inaccurate,” directed me to the note announcing the layoffs and wrote: “The changes today are driven by a desire to make Brex more agile and accelerate our path to profitability, building on the growth we had in 2023. We grew our revenue 35%+ in 2023 while gross profit increased by 75%. This reduction in force puts us on a clear path towards profitability.” She added: “Brexs financial plan is to be well above cash flow positive with the current cash we have, which calls for around 4 years of runway. Plus, cherry picking certain months for financial burn is not the correct way to look at burn.” Brex had a short-term boost to its business after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last year. But that growth has since slowed, largely due to the hike in interest rates and resulting slowdown in VC funding. With more startups failing and not growing, many of Brex’s customers began spending less overall. The company’s annualized net revenue was $279 million in the fourth quarter. While that was up 32%, most of that growth took place in the first quarter of the year. Employees affected by the restructuring will receive eight weeks of severance, with two additional weeks of pay for each additional year of service. The company is also offering a waiver of the one-year equity cliff for those who haven’t reached theirs yet. Things at Brex have been up and down since June of 2022, when the company declared that it was “less suited to meet the needs of smaller customers” in an announcement that caused shock waves in the startup community. While&nbsp;Brex soon clarified that by smaller customers it meant small- to medium-sized businesses and non-funded startups, the move still felt like a stunning reversal, considering the company had started its life as a credit card company&nbsp;for startups. The announcement came about two months after Brex announced a&nbsp;“big push into software” and that it was placing greater emphasis on moving upmarket to serve larger, enterprise customers. Last June, the company seemed to have an about-face, tapping Jason Mok, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) operating partner and more than 16-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank as its new head of startups. Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch at the time that “founders and startups have always been at the core of Brex.” The spend management space has grown increasingly competitive with players such as Ramp, Navan, Mesh Payments and Airbase (among others) clamoring for market share. In December, Navan, an expense management startup once known as TripActions, laid off 5% of its staff, or 145 people. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.",

Last week, Google laid off more than 1,000 workers across several divisions, including engineering, services and voice-activated product Google Assistant. “As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our companys biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” a Google spokesperson said in a provided statement. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, and to align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally.” Initially reported by Tubefilter, Youtube’s chief business officer, Mary Ellen Coe, wrote in an internal memo sent to staff on Wednesday afternoon that the job cuts were part of restructuring changes to its creator management and operations teams. The 100 affected employees apparently have a chance to apply for other positions at YouTube, yet this doesn’t necessarily mean a guaranteed position within the company. According to The New York Times, workers have 60 days to find new roles before their dismissals are officially in effect. “We’re continuing to support any impacted employees as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond,” the spokesperson added. We’re only three weeks into the new year and already have seen dozens of companies across the tech industry face job reductions, including Discord, Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios, as well as Audible, Duolingo, Instagram, Pixar and Unity, among others.

        "Extracted Article": "Artifact, the news aggregator-turned social network from Instagrams founders, is shutting down. On Friday, the startup announced via a blog post it had made the decision to wind down operations of the app launched over a year ago, saying that the market opportunity wasnt big enough to warrant continued investment. The team had rapidly iterated on its product from a SmartNews-like news reading app to a curation and news discovery platform where individual users could become creators of a sort, finding interesting gems from around the web that others could like and comment on. It also employed several AI tools to summarize news, rewrite clickbait headlines and surface the best content. However, the slate of changes had perhaps diluted the original value of the product, which was a simple news app that could take on the likes of built-in offerings on users phones, like Apple News. The end result was something more akin to a Twitter replacement but thats a market with numerous competitors, including, in fact, Metas Instagram, which has launched a Twitter/X rival called Threads. In the blog post, penned by Instagram and Artifact co-founder Kevin Systrom, he writes that acknowledging the market reality is something startups often fail to do, but making the tough call earlier is better for everyone involved. The biggest opportunity cost is time working on newer, bigger and better things that have the ability to reach many millions of people, Systrom writes. I am personally excited to continue building new things, though only time will tell what that might be. We live in an exciting time where artificial intelligence is changing just about everything we touch, and the opportunities for new ideas seem limitless, he said. To give users time to transition, the app will begin by shutting down various features, like the ability to comment and make posts. This will help reduce the moderation efforts. Existing posts will remain visible for the time being, and Artifact will continue to operate its core news capability through the end of February. The shutdown comes amid increased competition in the Twitter rival landscape but also a slowdown in the usage of other news aggregators, like SmartNews. The latter had a rough 2023, with layoffs and the replacement of its CEO, while its app has been losing downloads and active users. In part, the way users are finding news and information is changing with the arrival of AI. At the same time, publishers are finding their content has been wrapped up in AI training data, which is then queried by users of bots like OpenAI ChatGPT leading to lawsuits, in some cases, and licensing deals in others. For Artifact, it hadnt quite defined what it wanted to be a Twitter-esque conversation and discovery platform, a Pinterest rival for discovering interesting links or an AI-powered news engine. That may have led to a missed opportunity to capture users attention, as users didnt know how the app would fit into their usual workflows. Despite the shutdown, Systrom says that news and information remain critical areas for startup investment, and that he believes other bright minds are working on ideas in this area. The co-founder spoke about AIs role at Artifact at this past falls TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. A video of that talk is below. Artifact co-founder Mike Krieger says theres a flavor of Twitter in apps latest release Artifact takes on X and Threads with new Posts feature &nbsp;",

The move affected some 60% to 70% of the company, according to multiple sources familiar with internal operations. Sam Strasser, founder and CEO of Treasure Financial, told TechCrunch that “a need to streamline our operations and align our workforce with our current strategic goals and financial realities” drove the decision. “Market conditions and organizational challenges aside, financial stewardship necessitated this unfortunate but necessary action,” he added. Strasser did not yet confirm what percentage of employees were laid off, but did say Treasure offered severance packages to affected workers, as well as extended health benefits, and is helping them find new employment opportunities through a partnership at HuntClub. San Francisco-based Treasure Financial offers cash management software for businesses and is a registered investment advisor (RIA). Just last July, the startup raised $7.5 million in a funding round led by Ventura Capital, a previous investor in the firm. Existing backer PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel also participated in the financing, along with other unnamed investors. It had previously raised $7 million in funding. Last August, RIAIntel reported that Treasure Financial had seen “explosive growth…in the wake of 2023’s banking crisis and the Fed’s recent interest rate hikes.” The publication also reported that Treasure had more than doubled the clients it served to about 300 since the beginning of the year, and that it had almost doubled its assets under management over the same period, to roughly $500 million.

        "Extracted Article": "Pitch, the company behind a collaborative presentation software for businesses, is scaling back and bootstrapping, with CEO and co-founder Christian Reber stepping down and two-thirds of its employees losing their jobs. This translates roughly to 80 personnel, based on the 120 headcount figure Pitch has published on its about page. Reber made the announcement in a social media post earlier today, confirming that the companys co-founder and CTO Adam Renklint will be stepping into the hot-seat with immediate effect, with Reber retaining a seat on the company board. Founded in 2018, Berlin-based Pitch arrived in private beta back in 2019 with $30 million in funding, led by the creators of an app called Wunderlist which Microsoft bought in 2015. Pitch had raised north of $130 million in funding from the likes of Lakestar, Index Ventures and Tiger Global Management, supported by a slew of high-profile angels, including the founders of Instagram and Zoom. Pitch in action Image Credits: Pitch As with just about every other VC-backed startup, Pitch has clearly faced challenging times in terms of maintaining growth and keeping their investors happy. As many of you know, being a venture-backed company in 2023 was insanely challenging, Reber wrote. We created sky-high expectations for our business, our employees, and ourselves as founders. Towards the end of last year, my co-founders and I noticed that those expectations were simply too high, and we decided that we wanted to take a new and completely different path for Pitch. Organic growth Reber said in the post that rather than trying to build a hyper-growth company built on venture funding, its going back to the drawing board and pursuing profitability and then organic growth. This involved working with its investors about resetting our company and cap table, according to Reber, who stopped short of explaining exactly what that means. However, TechCrunch confirmed with someone with knowledge of the situation that Pitch essentially returned all unspent cash to its investors pro rata, reducing the investors ownership stake in the process. This means that current and past employees (including all the founders) now own 80% of Pitch, while the company has enough cash to see it through a couple of years either to profitability, or to a point where it can sell at a lower price than its previous valuation (which was $600 million in 2021). Part of this plan, of course, involves reducing its headcount significantly. And while the year is still young, todays layoff news alongside other recent layoffs suggests that 2024 could be set to follow on from where 2023 left off. We know that a sustainable path has a much higher chance of success than the path we were on, Reber added. Going forward, we’ll be a significantly smaller team focused on creating maximum value for our customers and driving sustainable growth. *This article was updated to include more detail on the nature of Pitchs cap table reset.",

        "Extracted Article": "Here, a fractional short-term vacation rental marketplace, has shut down its investment platform after just over two years of operation. The Miami-based startup, which had raised a known $5 million in funding, posted on its website on January 3 that it was shutting down the platform “due to the current interest rate environment and economic conditions.” Fiat Ventures led its $3.5 million seed round in July of 2022, according to Crunchbase. Other backers include Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures, Mucker Capital, Bragiel Brothers, Alumni Ventures, Gaingels, and a number of fintech executives. In a statement on its website, the company said its goal was to sell all of the properties that it holds within the next six months. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals the company had reported a net loss of $56,374 from its properties for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Notably, it generated $276,233 in revenue during the same period. But Here also reported paying $166,305 in interest during the same time frame, and $58,920 in “other expenses.” In a written statement via email, a company spokesperson: Only Here’s fractional investment platform shut down on January 3rd, 2024. Here’s other business units will continue to operate as usual. The company did not specify what those business units are, or respond to a query as to whether or not it had laid off staff. Here was founded in July of 2021 but didn’t launch operations until 2022. According to the publication ShortTermRentalz, the marketplace gave investors a way to acquire partial ownership of vacation rentals. Here handled the property management process, pledging that “members could earn monthly income on their investment proposition and potential property appreciation.” Here offered shares for as little as $1 as part of its self-described mission of providing a lower barrier to entry to invest in the vacation rental asset class. CEO and co-founder Corey Ashton Walters also co-founded Homeworthy, a remote cloud real estate brokerage. “Here has made impressive strides to democratize access to vacation rental investments, an asset class historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy, said Marcos Fernandez, managing partner of Fiat Ventures, in a written statement. Although the company is winding down its fractional investment platform, it is alive and operational, committed to its mission and actively pursuing new avenues.” Interest rates have surged over the past two years, contributing to a flurry of proptech startups to close up shop. Just last week, TechCrunch broke the news that Frontdesk, a short-term rental provider, had laid off its entire staff and was on the verge of shutting down. Last November, we reported on Zeus Living reportedly shutting down after raising $150 million in debt and equity.

Frontdesk, a startup that managed more than 1,000 furnished apartments across the United States, laid off its entire 200-person workforce Tuesday after attempts to raise more capital failed, TechCrunch exclusively learned from sources familiar with internal happenings at the company. The mass layoff comes just seven months after the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based startup acquired smaller rival Zencity. The layoffs, which included full-time, part-time workers and contractors, occurred Tuesday afternoon during “a two-minute Google Meet call, according to one employee who was among those attending the virtual meeting. During that call, Frontdesk CEO Jesse DePinto told employees that Frontdesk would be filing for a state receivership, an alternative to bankruptcy, according to the sources. The company has not responded to a request for comment. When calling the number on Frontdesks website, a recording says: “Currently, Frontdesk is unavailable. If you have a reservation, please seek alternative accommodations and expect to be contacted within the next two weeks.” TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. Frontdesk, which was founded in 2017, had raised about $26 million from investors such as JetBlue Ventures, Veritas Investments and Sand Hill Angels, according to Crunchbase. Frontdesk went out for a bridge round, attempting to sell investors on a new plan of doing full building management, sources told TechCrunch. That tactic didn’t work out and the company couldn’t keep operating. Frontdesk was apparently still optimistic about its ability to raise more capital; the startup had posted on LinkedIn openings for several jobs, including a chief of staff role, just two months ago. As a result of all the challenges, the company was not only not able to make rent on a number of properties but had little to no communication with the reportedly infuriated landlords, according to the sources. The startup’s business model, which is leasing apartments at market rental rates and furnishing them for short-term rentals in more than 30 markets, has struggled largely due to the upfront costs involved, associated capital expenditures and variables in demand and rates, one of the sources said. Others in the space have also had challenges, including Stay Alfred, Domio, Lyric, Zeus Living, The Guild and WanderJaunt. Ironically, Frontdesk previously acquired over 100 units across several cities from WanderJaunt, Stay Alfred, Lyric and Domio.",

        "Extracted Article": "Superpedestrian, the e-scooter startup known for its self-diagnostic software, is shutting down its U.S.-based shared scooter operation on December 31 and exploring a sale of its European business, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The companys director of U.S. operations, Alexander Berg, confirmed the news to his team Friday afternoon on a Zoom call. Berg said the reason for the shutdown was financial, but did not go into further detail. Even our investors have put in money to keep us afloat even to this point, he said on the call. It wasnt for lack of trying. The shutdown comes just 18 months since the startup raised $125 million in a Series C round of equity and debt financing that included investors Jefferies, Antara Capital, the Sony Innovation Fund by IGV and FM Capital alongside existing backers like Spark Capital, General Catalyst and Citi via the Citi Impact Fund. It appears Jeffries and Antara were two of the investors who helped try to keep the company afloat, as Superpedestrian assigned patents to each as collateral for loans of undisclosed amounts in July and October, respectively, according to documents filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The e-scooter industry has been in a somewhat rocky place since then, though. Birds valuation crashed after it went public, leading to the company pulling out of multiple markets. Superpedestrian itself has gone through a series of layoffs, including one just months after closing its Series C round. The latest, per a posting on LinkedIn, occurred earlier this month. On the call, Berg said Superpedestrian will run minimal staff while pulling scooters across the country back into warehouses over the next two weeks. Vanessa Carmack, Superpedestrians senior director of human resources for the U.S., who said she had been through layoffs at prior companies, told workers during the Zoom call that the experience was frustrating and said she felt kind of kept out of the loop. CEO Assaf Biderman held a short call with some employees earlier Friday initially announcing the decision. Biderman did not immediately respond to a voicemail and an emailed request for comment. Superpedestrian has said its scooters are in operation in 60-plus cities across 11 countries, though it pulled out of Chicago in September citing competitive difficulties. A representative from the city of Waco, Texas, where Superpedestrian recently spun up a scooter fleet, said in a phone call Friday that she was not aware of an impending shutdown. The startup used technology, and specifically diagnostic and safety software, to differentiate it from rivals like Bird and Tier. The company boosted its tech efforts by acquiring Navmatic in July 2021. It leveraged Navmatics technology to develop and then roll out a so-called pedestrian defense safety system, a feature designed to detect and correct unsafe riding behaviors, like riding on sidewalks, in real time. Superpedestrian had planned to build and roll out new scooters equipped with its branded Pedestrian Defense to 25 cities across the United States and Europe in 2022. The initial deployments were supposed to begin in the U.S. and the United Kingdom in pedestrian-dense cities by early spring, according to the company.",

        "Extracted Article": "Cruise, the embattled GM self-driving car subsidiary, is laying off 900 employees, or about 24% of its workforce, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The layoffs are part of a plan to slash costs and attempt to revamp the company following an October 2 incident that left a pedestrian stuck under and then dragged by one of its robotaxis. An email, penned by newly minted president and CTO Mo Elshenawy, was sent this morning to the entire 3,800-person workforce. The email, which TechCrunch has viewed, began with a resigned tone: We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult—especially for those whose jobs are affected, Elshenawy wrote. Workers were expected to be informed within the hour of receiving the company wide email as to whether they would be losing their job. GM, which acquired Cruise in 2016, was rewarded by shareholders for the cutbacks. GM shares rose 4.8% to $35.64 following the news. Cruise is targeting non-engineering jobs in the layoffs, particularly those people who worked in the field, commercial operations and corporate staffing, according to the email. The company has also ended additional assignments of contingent workers who supported its driverless operations. Engineering, a category that makes up the bulk of the Cruise workforce, is largely being preserved, according to the content of the email and discussions with internal sources. The email continued: Today, we are making staff reductions that will affect 24% of full-time Cruisers, through no fault of their own. We are simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale. As a result, we are reducing our employee counts in operations and other areas. These impacts are largely outside of engineering, although some Tech positions are impacted also. Workers will remain on the payroll through February 12 and will be eligible for an additional eight weeks of pay, with long-term employees offered an additional two weeks’ pay per every year at Cruise over three years, according to the email to staff. Anyone laid off will also receive their 2023 bonus (eligible target payout) on January 5, 2024. Other parts of the severance package include health benefits through the end of May, two months contribution into their 401(k) plan and continued time on payroll through March 24 for immigrants in lieu of a lump-sum severance payment to allow visa holders additional time to help transition and manage their immigration status. The company also said that all employees, regardless of whether they were laid off, will receive their January 15th vesting through its employee share-selling program. Cruise issued a statement confirming the layoffs. “We shared the difficult news that we are reducing our workforce, primarily in commercial operations and related corporate functions, the emailed statement reads. These changes reflect our decision to focus on more deliberate commercialization plans with safety as our north star. We are supporting impacted Cruisers with strong severance and benefits packages and are grateful to the departing employees who played important roles in building Cruise and supporting our mission.” The layoffs come just a day after nine senior leaders (SLT) at Cruise, who worked in its commercial operations, legal and policy departments, were dismissed by the companys board. COO Gil West and David Estrada, who was head of government affairs, were among that group. Elshenawy reiterated the company would be narrowing and refocusing its efforts, information shared last month following the resignation of co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt and some executive shuffling that included appointing Craig Glidden, GM’s EVP of legal and policy and a Cruise board member, as chief administrative officer at Cruise. Jon McNeill, a member of GM’s board, was also named vice chairman of the Cruise board. McNeill, who joined the Cruise board recently and was previously chief operating officer at Lyft and president of Tesla, now serves alongside GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra. Cruise executives said at the time they wanted to take a measured business approach that preserves cash and improves safety culture in an attempt to put GM’s troubled autonomous vehicle subsidiary on the right path. The first steps in that rebuilding plan, which included pausing production on its Origin robotaxi, were laid out in an internal email sent to employees in late November by Elshenawy, who was executive vice president of engineering at Cruise and ascended into the president role after co-founder and CEO Vogt resigned. Elshenawy repeated that intent in the Thursday morning email stating that the company was simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale. Cruise used all-electric Chevy Bolt vehicles, which have been specifically manufactured to support its self-driving system, in its robotaxi fleet. The company intended to shift toward a custom-built autonomous vehicle called the Origin. The layoffs have been largely expected at Cruise for weeks now. Last month. Barra reiterated plans for Cruise to be more “deliberate” when operations eventually resume at the troubled self-driving vehicle subsidiary. For GM, that includes slashing spending at Cruise “by hundreds of millions of dollars” in 2024, an action that most expected would result in widespread layoffs. GM and the Cruise board have been scrambling ever since the October 2 incident put the company in the crosshairs of state, local and federal agencies. However, Cruises robotaxi operations in San Francisco had been criticized by the public and city officials almost immediately after the California Public Utilities Commission issued the company in August the final permit required to operate commercially. Videos of Cruise robotaxis blocking traffic and driving into a construction site were shared on social media. But it was a crash with an emergency response vehicle that began to chip away at the companys seemingly impenetrable exterior. This story is developing .",

The startups new leadership, which informed the employees about the decision to shut down Tuesday, didnt respond to a request for comment. The startup will fully wind down by the end of the month, the leadership said. Moneycontrol first reported the development. The move follows ZestMoney founders quitting the startup in May this year after acquisition talks with fintech giant PhonePe didnt materialize. The founding team handed over the firm to three new leaders, who raised a few million dollars from existing investors and attempted to find a new path for the company. They engaged with many investors and fintech giants in recent months to explore deals, people familiar with the matter said. ZestMoney, once valued at $445 million, was among a handful of Indian startups that used alternative data points to help build credit profiles on consumers, making them eligible to make their first online purchases. India’s low credit card penetration has left a majority of the population without traditional credit scores, which banks rely on to evaluate creditworthiness before issuing loans. Furthermore, small loans do not yield significant returns for banks, disincentivizing them from issuing such financial products. In response, ZestMoney, alongside other emerging startups like Axio and LazyPay, has attempted to carve out a niche in a market traditionally dominated by financial giant Bajaj Finance. Tuesdays news is the second blow for Omidyar Network this week.

        "Extracted Article": "Its a tough day for Dataminr, the New York-based big data unicorn last valued at $4.1 billion. TechCrunch has learned that the company which uses AI and big data algorithms to provide predictive insights about news and other global events, is laying off about 20% of staff today, or around 150 people. It cites the impact of the economic environment, operational efficiencies, and the recent rapid advancements of our AI platform, according to a memo from founder and CEO Ted Bailey, shared with us by a source. In the company-wide memo that we have seen, staff were told to work from home today while they waited for details on whether they would be part of the impacted group of employees. The company had been signaling to staff since October that a restructuring was coming, although its not clear what business areas are being affected, nor what the state of the companys business has been like recently. Bailey noted in the memo that the restructuring measures will put Dataminr on a very strong financial footing moving forward. The company will be looking to further progress its AI platform and products specifically with the launch of a new AI platform in Q1 that will combine predictive AI with generative AI but even with the investment that those will require, as a result of the moves its making today, Dataminr will have multiple years of cash runway and a near-term path to profitability, he continued. (That potentially also implies that its setting itself up for a scenario in which it wont be raising more outside funding.) We have reached out to Bailey, the companys media relations team and various other individuals to confirm the details provided to us by a source (who, unfortunately, appears to be among those impacted: really sorry again, friend). One of those individuals, who asked not to be named, also confirmed the details. In the meantime, there are now posts on LinkedIn from others hearing the news through the grapevine and looking to hire. And just as we were about to hit publish on this, a spokesperson from the company confirmed the memo to us. Dataminr, founded in 2009, first came to prominence at a time when we were seeing the emergence of companies using clever big data techniques to parse unstructured data from social media posts and combining it with structured and unstructured data from other sources to understand public sentiment and other insights. Dataminr took that concept and applied it squarely to insights about global events and other news. Users equipped with mobile phones used platforms like Twitter as an outlet to post about something they were seeing; Dataminr tapped into this, combined it with other data sources, and was able to pick up a development right as it was happening, often ahead of the rest of the world jumping on the news. Unsurprisingly, some of the data it gathered and how it got used has courted controversy over the years. But that didnt appear to stop the company from gaining traction. Dataminr found success with key partnerships with companies like Twitter, and customers in government, enterprise, financial services and media. And in the heady funding days of the 2010 decade, it raised money a lot of it. It was last valued at $4.1 billion when it raised $475 million in 2021. Overall, it has raised more than $1 billion, with its 100+ investors including the likes of Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, as well as Venrock, IVP and many more. (Twitter, now called X, was once also an investor, although it divested its stake some time ago.) PitchBook data indicates that it raised an undisclosed sum in further funding in two different tranches in the last year. Dataminr has always had a large number of subject experts that it had on staff alongside engineers and sales and customer success specialists. In more recent years, and most likely this year, the company has really doubled down on the AI aspect of its tech stack, one reason why it might see a route forward downsizing its workforce without impacting business.",

        "Extracted Article": "German micromobility operator Tier Mobility is laying off another 22% of its workforce to cut costs in the never-ending grind toward profitability, according to a LinkedIn post from CEO Lawrence Leuschner. The hits keep coming for the micromobility giant, which sailed into 2022 on a high note. By March 2022, Tier had raised a $200 million Series D from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Mubadala Capital, and had acquired docked e-bike share company Nextbike, Wind Mobilitys Italian unit and Fantasmo, a startup building camera-based scooter parking validation technology. The micromobility giant also acquired Spin from Ford, a move designed to help the company break into the North American market. Come August 2022, Tier would issue its first major round of layoffs, cutting 180 staff members amid a poor funding climate. Five months later, Tier laid off 100 people across the Tier and Spin brands. In May, Tier raised a convertible note to keep it running while it searched for a buyer, after acquisition talks with Bolt and Lime reportedly fell through. In September, Tier sold off Spin to Bird, another struggling micromobility company, for $19 million. Todays layoffs come as Tier reckons with what many startups and scale-ups have learned in the past year growth and expansion is out, profitability is in. That means reducing operational losses, which can be caused by redundancies in the workforce. In his post, Leuschner said Tier has been working tirelessly to get to profitability. The company improved EBITDA from -62% in 2022 to be on track for -15% in 2023. He also said he expects Tier to be profitable on an annual basis for 2023 in 80% of its markets, including Germany, the U.K. and France. Leuschner also said its e-bikes unit has been able to achieve profitability in 2023. Despite some wins, Leuschner said Tier hasnt made it to profitability yet, which means theres still more we need to do and decisions we need to make for 2024. With not enough visibility on how and if markets will recover, we have to presume demand in 24 will look like demand in 23, he wrote. This means that to get to profitability, we need to bring our cost base down. The layoffs today affect around 140 employees. Tier did not respond in time to say which teams will be most affected by the layoffs, only saying the job cuts would be to the companys central and regional workforce, with the majority of affected roles sitting centrally. Tier has already said goodbye to a large handful of top staffers this year, including the companys co-founder and chief technology officer Matthias Laug, who left in February, citing personal reasons. Others have also left in the last six months, including Tiers head of engineering, VP of finance, SVP of corporate strategy and develop and VP of product and growth.",

This decision comes as part of a streamlining effort, particularly in markets where the company had previously hired technical roles to support its primary operations in Africa. Paystack reduced its workforce by 33 employees, as highlighted by co-founder and CEO Shola Akinlade in a tweet on Thursday. Following its acquisition by U.S.-based fintech Stripe, Paystack expanded its geographical presence by establishing offices in Accra, Cape Town, Dubai and Nairobi. This expansion was complemented by recruiting staff in Europe through remote operations and establishing an engineering hub in Dubai. Paystack had already maintained offices in Lagos and San Francisco prior to these developments. Today was a difficult day at Paystack.

The company, characterized by its lean operation, has experienced a moderate expansion in staff strength, contributing to a series of product releases over the past three years. Notable developments include introducing an app for Shopify, launching a terminal device and, most recently, adding a direct debit feature. Paystack has also developed integrations with global software and payment solutions, with notable examples being ApplePay. The company is undergoing private beta testing in Ivory Coast, Egypt and Rwanda as part of its strategic expansion efforts. Nigerian businesses can now accept Apple Pay on Paystack Yet, despite the progress on these fronts, the Stripe subsidiary, which has over 150 employees per LinkedIn, acknowledges it’s time to change strategy. Stripe itself had laid off 14% of its team last year and a few dozen this June. “We’re changing our operating model to prioritize locating team members within the markets we serve, to localize costs and get closer to customers,” Akinlade said. The chief executive noted that those affected will receive a severance package that includes four months’ salary, accelerated equity vesting and health insurance extended by three months. “These are some of the most talented people I’ve ever worked with, and my goal is to ensure that every single one finds new roles as soon as possible. I’m personally happy to vouch for each one and do reference calls as needed,” he added in the tweet while leaving a form for parties interested in hiring the affected Paystack employees, whose roles cut across software engineering, legal and compliance, finance, sales and marketing, product design and human resources.

        "Extracted Article": "Chewy, the online pet supplies company that sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion, but then split off a few years later, is the latest company to undergo layoffs, TechCrunch has learned. According to multiple sources, the pet supplier has laid off more than 200 employees a figure Chewy confirmed including those in its Plantation, Florida headquarters, and other sites. The company is dually headquartered in both Florida and Boston, with offices in Minneapolis and Bellevue, as well. Chewy confirmed the layoffs took place across multiple locations and said the number of people impacted was north of 200. According to various sources, we understand that the impacted roles spanned HR, recruiting, data and business intelligence, and even included some directors and higher managers, including a vice president. Chewy didnt confirm the job roles it eliminated, but there is talk of the headcount reductions on discussion forums like Blind, where users are reporting Chewy reduced its headcount by 220 people, and noted the reductions included some engineers, developers, product managers and supply chain personnel. The company is said to be providing a minimum of one months severance with additional weeks based on tenure, these users said. Chewy confirmed the layoffs in a statement. As we head into 2024, we took the opportunity to consolidate some of our headcount and align our efforts into priorities which we believe will gain us the most significant customer wins and generate the highest business returns, to enable us to strengthen the company’s future, said Chewy spokesperson, Diane Pelkey. This was a difficult decision that was carefully considered as part of our overall strategy and ongoing focus on becoming an ever more agile and disciplined company. We are grateful to our team members for their contributions and remain committed to supporting them during this transition, she added. Though Chewy reported a surprise profit of 4 cents per share in its most recent quarter on revenue of $2.78 billion, analysts were concerned over the declining active users of the e-commerce site, which fell from 20.49 million in the year-ago quarter to 20.39 million. Chewy CEO Sumit Singh had also expressed concerns over how inflation was impacting its business, creating more cautious consumers who were now buying lower-priced items, like dry dog food, instead of wet food, and were pulling back on buying pet treats. Coming out of the summer months, we are sensing a shift in consumer mindset toward being more discernible and, at the same time, with a higher willingness to consolidate their share of wallet to their trusted retailer of choice, Singh said on a call with investors. This behavior is driven by a more fluid macro environment, including high levels of inflation, which have been passed through the industry over the past 18 months. Our dialog with our suppliers confirms that these trends are permeating throughout the pet industry, he noted. Chewy was earlier acquired by BC Partners, which also bought PetSmart for $8.7 billion in March 2015. Chewy went public in 2019 and BC Partners later split up PetSmart and Chewy, but remained a large shareholder in Chewys business. BC partners sold a minority stake in PetSmart to Apollo earlier this year. (Disclosure: Apollo owns Yahoo, TechCrunchs parent company.) Also earlier in 2023, an advocacy group asked the Department of Labor to investigate BC Partners boards over concerns about overlapping directors as some directors sat on both the PetSmart and Chewy boards, despite the split.

        "Extracted Article": "The grip Twitter, now called X, has on the market may be stronger than some believed. Unfortunately, thats led to the first casualty among Twitter alternatives, as the startup Pebble (formerly T2), is shutting down. The would-be X rival had grown a small but engaged community on its microblogging service that aimed to dupe Twitters features, from its verification systems to functionality like DMs. But the company says theyve run out of time to make Pebble happen the app maxed out at 3,000 daily active users, out of 20,000 registered users. That daily user figure fell to 1,000 daily users following its rebranding from T2. In part, the sizable competition coming from other Twitter rivals was to blame, says co-founder and CEO Gabor Cselle, who had exits to Google and Twitter prior to starting Pebble. I think the competitive landscape evolved faster than we had thought, he explains. I didnt think that quite as many people established organizations and newcomers would try to do the same thing that we were doing and in very similar ways. Today, the market for Twitter alternatives is a crowded one, to say the least. There are numerous services for consumers to try, including the open source-based platform Mastodon, a soon-to-be decentralized system from Bluesky, plus smaller startups like Spill, Spoutible and Post, as well as a new app from Meta called Instagram Threads. Then, of course, theres the X factor to consider. The default platform for short posts retains some pull, despite or perhaps because of new owner Elon Musks antics. Though the company may not have yet succeeded from a business and financial perspective, its been hard for others to duplicate its function as a breaking news platform and place for spirited debates. I think Threads and others have encountered this as well, adds Pebble co-founder and CTO Michael Greer, previously Discord engineering head. The durability of the network effect of Twitter is stronger than anticipated, he says. Image Credits: Pebble Despite these challenges, Pebble initially had decent retention. By week four, it was seeing retention rates of 30%, in fact. Its invite list was also working, as 60% of people who received a Pebble invite converted to become users. In addition, some 10,000 users arrived at that list from early press, like TechCrunchs coverage of its first outside funding a $1.1 million angel round that included investors like former Google VP Bradley Horowitz, Android co-founder Rich Miner and the former CEO of Wikipedia, Katherine Maher. Data from Similarweb indicates the Pebble website topped 99,300 visits last month, indicating repeat usage. The companys hypothesis was that consumers were hungry for a Twitter alternative that prioritized trust, safety and moderation from the start. To that end, Pebbles founding team included co-founder Sarah Oh, Twitter’s former human rights advisor. Pebble continues to believe its approach to moderation was correct, even if it was not ultimately a factor in driving growth. We came in with a particular angle: kinder, safer. Trust and safety. And I think our approach to moderation that we did have on the site did work, says Cselle, adding that Pebble didnt have some of the issues other federated platforms faced. For example, TechCrunch reported that Bluesky earlier this year had strained its relationship with Black users, as it failed to crack down on bigotry on the site. Later, users on Bluesky were even creating usernames with racial slurs, and yet the platform didnt issue a public apology. Pebble never faced any such controversies. But it may have positioned itself a little too far into the kindness territory, the founders now believe. We were really seized by people saying they wanted something that felt safer, where they could speak openly without dogpiling, says Oh. And so we were confident that was an important thing to hit. Are there other things that are equally important and a great user experience? Yes. Twitter is you have real peoplesaying real things, Oh continues. At the expense of using a word thats overused, authentic. And our theory was always if you can create a space where people really feel like they can let down their hair, then you would get that authentic content. We didnt quite get there, she admits. Cselle agrees, noting that, perhaps, Pebble should have opened up enough space for disagreement to happen, while still drawing a hard line on the most disagreeable parts of running a Twitter-like platform. I think we could have maybe moved a little bit further towards that, he says. Theres a lot of nice things that are said on Pebble, but maybe not enough breaking news. Not enough conversation. There were other things that may have hurt Pebbles traction, too, including its lack of a native mobile app. As T2, the startup prioritized building for the web to be agile and more flexible, but lost out on the opportunities for discovery driven by the app stores. Notes Greer, that might have been a mistake. In retrospect, Cselle also questions if the rebranding from T2 to Pebble may have been an issue. Im wondering if the Pebble rebrand had actually softened the value prop[position] because T2 just encapsulated it so much that it was really duplicative [of Twitter], he says. Image Credits: Pebble Like most startup shutdowns, the answer as to why is not any one thing but a combination of factors. For Pebble, thats certainly true. It was a perfect storm of competition, Xs continued traction, the lack of a native app, a brand that didnt resonate and a space that was maybe a little too safe to be as addictive and as fun as the original. With Pebbles winddown, being announced to users today at 9 AM PT, early adopters will have the option of exporting their Pebble archive as a zip file that loads a mini web page showcasing all their old posts. Pebble wont be directing users back to X however, or any other social network. Image Credits: Pebble screenshot As for where the founders will now hang out? I dont know. Maybe LinkedIn, Cselle jokes. Pebble is also returning a small amount of the funds left over to its investors, more as a courtesy to show financial responsibility. The Pebble website will be shut down on November 1st and there arent further plans for the IP at this time. The founders dont regret their experience building Pebble, even though it didnt turn out as they hoped, they said. Says Cselle, One thing that I learned is that theres absolutely an audience that wants to see a new kind of Twitter-like platform built and will ask for the features that Twitter has.

        "Extracted Article": "Roblox China was once full of promise. Since its localized platform, which is a joint effort with Tencent, abruptly halted operation nearly two years ago, the company has been quiet about its standing in the worlds second-biggest gaming market. Until now. TechCrunch has exclusively learned that Roblox China, also called LuoBu (罗布乐思), initiated a round of layoffs in October. A spokesperson for Roblox confirmed to TechCrunch that 15 roles, which comprised a small number of Roblox Chinas teams in the U.S. and its headquarters in Shenzhen, were affected. The decision was made after an evaluation of the operational structure in support of LuoBu, said the spokesperson. Those employees whose roles were impacted have been informed. These actions are specific to LuoBu and its unique business and operational needs. No other teams within LuoBu or at Roblox are impacted. Roblox gave no further information on which roles were cut. Roblox Chinas headcount is in the range of 100-499 according to its listing on Boss Zhipin, a major recruiting site in China. The new layoffs arrived not long after Robloxs significant reduction in its talent acquisition team, which marked the children-oriented gaming giants shift of focus from expansion to its bottom line. TechCrunch has also reached out to Tencent, which runs the LuoBu joint venture with Roblox, for comment on the layoff. In 2019, Tencent and Roblox established a joint venture in China in which Roblox would hold a 51% controlling stake, a rare instance where the foreign entity was granted the majority share. The goal was to build a localized version of Robloxs gaming platform, which is known for its user-programmed games, while Tencent would provide the necessary gaming license for its foreign partner to operate in China. The challenge of running any platform that thrives on user-generated content in China is to ensure the content is in line with Beijings censorship rules and cross-border data regulations. Those stipulations can be nebulous and cumbersome. So when LuoBuLeSi, the Chinese version of Roblox, suddenly paused service in December 2021, its well-informed users werent all that surprised. Roblox was candid about its unique challenge in China at the time: We always knew that building a compelling platform in China is an iterative process, and we are thankful for the support of LuoBuLeSi users and our global developer community. There is no sign that Roblox is giving up on its China dream. Commenting on the new layoff, its spokesperson said: We remain committed to our long-term vision and plan for the LuoBu platform in China. Roblox isnt the only one facing hurdles in the Chinese gaming market. Blizzard Activision, the California-based gaming publisher behind World of Warcraft and Overwatch, began to roll back operations in China in January after its 14-year license with its local partner NetEase expired. At the time, the gaming giant said it would be looking for a new publishing partner. Roblox pauses service in China as it takes important transitory actions",

        "Extracted Article": "Plume, a startup founded to offer essential online healthcare services to trans people across the U.S., laid off more than two dozen workers in October, several sources close to the company told TechCrunch. Transphobia is rife within the healthcare industry; its one reason why transgender patients struggle to access basic care. Legal barriers are also on the rise. In the U.S. alone, state lawmakers have introduced close to 150 bills this year to restrict trans healthcare. The need to expand access to life-saving, gender-affirming therapy was apparent when Plume launched four years ago, just as its clear today, particularly for folks in rural areas. So its disconcerting to see telehealth company Plume, a rarity in the startup world for its focus on serving marginalized people, quietly lay off around one sixth of its workers. About a year ago, the startup raised a $24 million Series B. A spokesperson confirmed in an email to TechCrunch that Plume laid off a portion of its staff. The spokesperson said the layoffs were part of a decision to accelerate the build out of its fee-for-service business, which will make gender affirming care more accessible and affordable to the majority of the trans community. According to Plume, laid-off employees received severance and a range of support services. Plume said it isnt pulling back its offerings. Today, the startups website promotes a monthly membership for trans folks seeking hormone therapy, as well as a one-time fee for letters of support requested by insurers and surgeons. Down the line, it seems like Plume will expand to offer other services for a one-time fee. One TechCrunch source, who left Plume earlier this year, said they heard about the layoffs from former colleagues. The writing was on the wall this summer, the source said. They definitely squeezed people out early by creating a pretty toxic work environment for myself and other trans folks, the source added. It was all a really disappointing experience. In response, a spokesperson said the company strives to be a thriving, supportive workplace and we celebrate diversity. They added that a co-founder of Plume is trans, and approximately 70 percent of the team is trans or gender diverse, and reflective of the members we serve. Plume co-founder Jerrica Kirkley said in August that the startup has worked with 13,000 patients across 45 states since 2019. Its only been about a year since Plumes Series B. However, many companies a bit further down the VC funding path — middle-aged ones, as reporter Joanna Glasner puts it — are struggling to access funds. Its considerably tougher this year than it was last year to secure Series C rounds in particular. The slowdown is driving many late-stage startups to cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, according to a Q3 PitchBook-NVCA report.

        "Extracted Article": "In August, we reported that a four-year-old, venture-backed remodeling startup called Made Renovation was failing its customers, by their own telling. Though it marketed itself as a one-stop shop to beautify bathrooms it offered potential customers a variety of templates, then promised to pair them with in-house project managers, help with required permits, assign them contractors, order the required materials and offer updates and virtual assistance until every renovation was complete people increasingly complained to the company, on social media and to this editor, that what Made Renovation was really providing was broken promises, long delays and cost overruns. One customer told TechCrunch that a general contractor assigned to her project by Made refused to demolish her old bathroom, dismantling only the top half. Another shared that Made disbanded its project management team without alerting him and spun the cost-cutting development as a positive for customers. It subsequently sent him a downloadable “Self-Management Construction Support Guidebook.” Meanwhile, over at HomeAdvisor, a digital marketplace that connects service professionals with customers, Made Renovation received half a star out of five across seven reviews listed. Made Renovation is “[w]here dreams of great-looking bathroom remodeling and belief in seamless project management go to die,” wrote one reviewer. “Absolute nightmare of an experience!” wrote another. The founder and then CEO of Made Renovation, Roger Dickey, didnt respond to our requests for comment at the time. Now, two months later, the company, which had raised at least $31 million across two rounds of fundings, has let its shareholders know that it is closing the business and selling off certain assets of the company to an unnamed acquirer as quickly as possible. (Maybe before the acquirer changes its mind?) Richard Couch, the chairman and CEO of a turnaround firm, Diablo Management Group, authored the note, saying that his firm is actively unwinding the company and that, while Made still exists, he has been appointed its CEO and sole director. What that means for Mades customers isnt clear. We have reached out to Couch for more information. Meanwhile, the Walnut Creek, California, number listed in his letter to shareholders prompts an error message, saying that calls to the number cannot be completed as dialed. Heres the letter that was sent out this past Saturday: October 15, 2023 To All MADE Shareholders: This correspondence is to inform you that, effective October 10th, 2023, MADE Renovations [MADE, the Company] announced that it had received a formal Letter of Intent from a potential acquiror who seeks to purchase certain assets of the Company as quickly as possible. Following this sale, the company intends to close the business, release all employees, and settle all affairs of the Company to the extent that resources and circumstances will allow. Effective on the same date, the MADE Board of Directors engaged the services of Diablo Management Group [DMG], a nationally recognized turnaround and consulting firm, for the purpose of managing the companys sale of assets and business closure. I, Richard G. Couch, Chairman and CEO of DMG, have been appointed as CEO and the sole Director of MADE. With this action, all Officers of the Company have been released and all members of the Board have resigned, except Mr. Couch. Although we are in active negotiations and planning with a potential purchaser, we cannot predict a successful outcome nor make any estimate of value at this time. Should this transaction not be completed, we will proceed with business cessation. We are in the process of determining the total assets and liabilities of the Company. While this process is underway, cash resources have sufficiently diminished such that we have suspended payments on any past due obligations of the Company. We will provide updates on our progress as soon as possible. Contact with the Company should be directed to the following: • Phone: 925-979-XXXX • Email: info@maderenovations.com Sincerely, Richard G.

We are committed to providing our full support to all impacted employees during this transition and ensuring that they are treated with care and respect.

        "Extracted Article": "Braid, a four-year-old startup that aimed to make shared wallets more mainstream among consumers, has shut down. Founded in January 2019 by Amanda Peyton and Todd Berman (who left in 2020), San Francisco-based Braid set out to offer friends and family an FDIC-insured, multi-user account that was designed to make it easy “to pool, manage and spend money together.” Users could create a cash pool toward a collective goal of, say, saving for a trip to Europe and then spend it on airfare or lodging using a branded debit card. Braid raised a total of $10 million in funding “over multiple rounds” from Index Ventures, Accel and others, according to Peyton’s LinkedIn page. In a blog post, Peyton said that Braid closed its doors in September and outlined her experiences in building the company, ultimately realizing that it wasn’t going to be a viable business venture. In the post, Peyton took responsibility for Braids demise, but stressed her belief that it was important to share her story of what happened. “I have no regrets, Peyton said in an interview with TechCrunch. We did it the right way: Every customer dollar was cashed out; every employee was treated with care. There is magic in failure too, if you squint a bit. We were given the opportunity to take a big swing and it’s important to recognize how rarely that happens in life. She added of the shutdown: It was terrible, it totally sucksBut its part of the life cycle. I think its just part of what you sign up for. And its part of why we do thisI did YC in 2010 and that is one of those things that sticks with you forever. Part of their whole thing is there just needs to be more startups we just need to do more. There needs to be more than more people starting startups. There needs to be more opportunitiesBut [failure] its this part of that cycle. And I think its the part that people dont talk about a lot, but its just as important as the seed round or the launch. Also in her blog post, Peyton described the struggles that Braid faced after having issues with a sponsor bank that led to the company “effectively [being] in a coma from July 2022 to January 2023.” Without a sponsor bank, the company was in limbo. It was bleak we were a payments company processing $0 in payment volume, she wrote. Despite finding a new sponsor bank, Braid continued to struggle. One of the biggest takeaways from her experience, Peyton said, was that leveraging third-party software would not necessarily help the company move faster and focus on its core offering. She wrote: “What we found, instead, was every additional partner had the potential to break big, important parts of our stack. Building a multiplayer offering meant we had to be as close to the metal as possible, because a lot of our UX didn’t really exist off-the-shelf. After several painful migrations, our distaste for contractual and technical lock-in grew dramatically. By the end, if there was something we could build ourselves in Retool, we did. In addition, building mostly in-house was the only way our unit economics worked. There’s a lot of great fintech software out there, but if that software eats your entire margin, you’ll end up dead regardless.” Looking ahead, Peyton noted that she, post shutdown, purchased the intellectual property for Braid in an auction. I Iove fintech, she told TechCrunch. I love payments. I think theres enormous, humongous opportunity here. Prior to co-founding Braid, Peyton worked at Google and Etsy. She also started another company called Grand St., a marketplace for creative and indie technology products that was acquired by Etsy in April of 2014 for an undisclosed amount. Peyton also started another e-commerce company that wasnt venture-backed, as well as a mobile messaging company that went through a YC cohort and that the founder noted also failed.

The company earlier this month announced layoffs, but didnt give an indication of how widespread those cuts were. We now understand the cuts impacted around 60% of the team, including design, product, sales and other roles. Product Hunts about page indicates engineering, ads and community staff remain. The layoffs were first publicly announced on October 10, when CEO Rajiv Ayyangar posted on X in an effort to help connect former employees with hiring opportunities. He wrote: This week I did a round of layoffs at Product Hunt across multiple functions. We had to narrow the roles on our team for speed and focus. Were parting ways with talented individuals who care deeply about their work and teammates. If youre hiring, dm me I’d love to connect you.

If youre hiring, dm me I’d love to connect you… &mdash; Rajiv Ayyangar (@rajivayyangar) October 10, 2023 The size of the layoff was first leaked by longtime Product Hunt user, Chris Messina, an open source advocate and tech veteran turned investor. Messina, who is still active on the site, has hunted 3,690 products over the years more than any other Product Hunt user, allowing him a close connection to the company and its team. On Threads, he wrote that Product Hunt had cut 70% of staff, but the CEO tells us that figure was a little high. Image Credits: Chris Messina on Threads (opens in a new window) It was actually around 60% of the team, Ayyangar explained. Our About page was a little out of date, he noted. Ayyangar, a former Product Hunt user himself, had only just joined the company in September after prior roles as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Dropbox and CEO and co-founder of virtual office startup Tandem. In his introduction to the Product Hunt community, the new exec hinted that changes were ahead for the product discovery platform. He suggested that while the site remained the best place to discover your next favorite product before they went mainstream (wed argue that place is TechCrunch, of course), the company admittedly had not done a great job of helping people find the best product for their needs, despite the wealth of contributions weve collected from our community, he wrote. In addition, Ayyangar suggested that the site needed to leverage new technology, like AI, as well as moderation and other tooling to get better at spotlighting whats new in tech. And while it would still continue to exist as a launch platform, it was also adding other features that took it beyond the launch, like Pro Tips product pages that would serve as a wiki for favorite products, he said. Ayyanger tells TechCrunch the layoffs were not due to economic factors. It wasnt for financial or company performance reasons, he said. Traffic has never been higher and were in a great place, financially. It was for strategic reasons. The laid-off staff did receive severance, he also noted. Its an interesting time for Product Hunt to redefine itself, given the explosion in AI advances that make single-purpose, smaller tools that developers would tinker around with in their spare time less of an interest. Businesses, meanwhile, are looking to cut costs during the economic downturn, which means reducing SaaS (software-as-a-service) spending by 10% to 30%, as TechCrunch recently reported. That begs the question as to how many companies would be willing to experiment with new SaaS products, like those theyd discover on Product Hunt or elsewhere. Originally a YC and a16z-backed startup, Product Hunt was acquired by AngelList for $20 million in 2016, spun out in 2020, and in 2021 inspired a new fund, Hyper, which would exist as a sister company for the site. The program included an exclusive Product Hunt launch event and investor demo day. Hypers program has now been sunset and it isnt running any new batches, Ayyangar confirmed to TechCrunch. However, the team will continue to support the companies already in its portfolio, he said. &nbsp; Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com or (415) 234-3994 on Signal.",

The electric van maker said on Tuesday that it took actions on October 5 to further reduce costs. Those actions include letting go of up to approximately 25% of its workers, the company stated in a letter to investors. Arrival last announced layoffs in January, when it said it would cut its workforce by 50% to around 800 employees. The firm didnt respond on Tuesday when TechCrunch asked for the number of employees it intends to lay off this time. EV company Arrival to cut workforce by 50% in third restructuring effort Arrival has had its hands in everything from developing electric vans and buses to cars for ride-hailing drivers, but it has yet to announce any commercial vehicle launches. South Carolina approved Arrival for a $500,000 grant and job development credits in 2020, a spokesperson for the states Commerce Department told TechCrunch. The spokesperson said the state intended for the grant to offset costs related to building improvements in connection with Arrival’s first U.S. electric vehicle micro factory in Rock Hill. The company must meet certain job and investment commitments by December 3, 2025, or else itll be required to repay a pro rata portion of the grant funds disbursed, the spokesperson added. Arrival went public in 2021 by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Its since restructured several times and pivoted its focus away from the U.K. market to the U.S. It did so, at least in part, to take advantage of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for commercial vehicle purchases. Arrivals current status is a bit of an open question; the company hasnt shared a quarterly update since publishing its first-quarter results in the middle of May. The firm also recently scaled back its North American headquarters about 30 miles north of Rock Hill — in Charlotte, North Carolina. Corrected Oct 11 to reflect that Arrival received job development credits in 2020, not 2022.",

        "Extracted Article": "Bird, the shared micromobility company that was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange last week, is issuing another round of layoffs, according to an email interim CEO Michael Washinushi sent to the company. TechCrunch has viewed the email. TechCrunch has been unable to confirm the number of people affected by the layoffs. Bird has yet to respond to our questions for clarification, but we will update this story once they do. The reduction in headcount comes two weeks after Bird acquired Spin, another shared e-scooter operator based in the U.S. At the time, Bird said the geographic overlap between the two companies was minimal. Spin operates in more than 50 cities and university campuses across the country. with any acquisition and integration process, there are redundancies in roles and scope that the business isnt able to maintain while meeting its goals, wrote Washinushi. Regrettably, today we need to reduce our headcount in order to achieve our broader goals and to ensure that the entire organization can sustain itself and continue its mission Washinushi continued to say that Bird needs to create the most efficient integrated team possible, which involves cutting certain members of staff. Impacted employees received a calendar invite for a meeting with a senior leader in their department on the day Washinushi sent the email. The email details next steps, including opportunities for teams to discuss the events and an all-hands town hall meeting to talk about the layoffs and learn more about how the Spin integration will play out. Bird has struggled to reach profitability since going public via a special purpose acquisition merger in November 2021. At the time, Birds implied valuation was $2.3 billion, but the companys stock price began plummeting soon after its debut. And as Birds balance sheets became part of the public sphere detailing rampant cash burn without the revenue to back it up investors continued to lose confidence. Bird isnt uniquely bad at succeeding in the scooter business. Despite the hype that inflated the companys valuation, deploying shared vehicles is actually tough to get right due to the businesss high-cost, low-return nature. However, Bird didnt do itself any favors by following a growth-at-all-costs spending model. The company also moved to an asset-light business model that relies on a fleet manager program run by independent contractors to deploy scooters. This has led to less control over the placement of vehicles, which can affect revenue. Bird also delayed rolling out scooters with swappable batteries, which likely added to its cost of operations and decreased asset utilization. The companys missteps caught up with it in the summer of 2022, when Bird had to lay off 23% of staff and shut down its retail scooter product in an effort to rein in costs and work toward profits. In September of the same year, Shane Torchiana took over as CEO, replacing Birds founder Travis VanderZanden. Torchiana, who subsequently left the company in August 2023, implemented a strategy of severe cost cuts, which included leaving dozens of unprofitable markets across the U.S., as well as Sweden, Norway and Germany. His strategy also involved increasing fleet utilization by incentivizing fleet managers to rebalance more efficiently, rather than just putting scooters where the managers thought theyd get more rides. Birds second-quarter earnings 2023 show that that strategy didnt really pan out. Average rides per vehicle per day were down 19% year-over-year. In November 2022, Bird issued a going concern warning, claiming it might not have enough funds to continue operations. That warning has remained in effect until present day. In the end, Bird was delisted after failing to maintain a market capitalization above $15 million for 30 consecutive days. Can Birds Spin acquisition give it the lift it needs?",

The San Francisco-based company, which operates a platform enabling banks and fintech companies to easily develop financial services, has been open about past layoffs. In June, CEO Sankaet Pathak wrote in a blog post that the company had let go of 18% of its workforce as “the current macroeconomic conditions” had begun to impact its clients and platforms, affecting its anticipated growth. Today, via email, a company spokesperson sent the following statement: “We deeply regret saying goodbye to incredibly talented and dedicated members of Synapse team. However, we have a strong group in place to manage all of our operations and support our customers going forward. We don’t have anything to add to this right now beyond what’s been previously reported.” Earlier this week, Fintech Business Weekly publisher Jason Mikula posted on X that “one of the company’s largest clients, Mercury, gave notice of non-renewal &amp; plans to move directly to Evolve.” He had also heard that the company was actually laying off at least 130 people. In 2019, TechCrunch reported on the company’s $33 million Series B raise led by Andreessen Horowitz after rebranding from SynapseFi. That was the company’s last known fundraise. In total, it has brought in just over $50 million in venture capital. The startup was founded in 2014 by Bryan Keltner and India-born CEO Sankaet Pathak, who came to the U.S. to study but grew frustrated at the difficulty of opening a bank account without U.S. social security history.

        "Extracted Article": "IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director and funded by cyber and defense investors, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. In a regulatory filing published Friday, IronNets president and chief financial officer Cameron Pforr said the company had ceased all business activities as it prepares for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, effectively liquidating the companys remaining assets to pay its remaining debts. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander, soon after he departed as the former director of the National Security Agency during the biggest leak (at the time) of government secrets by former contractor Edward Snowden. IronNet provided corporations and government agencies with technologies aimed at helping to defend against cyber threats, and using large datasets and analytics to automate threat intelligence. Its other products were designed to protect critical infrastructure. To date, the company raised more than $400 million in funding, including a $78 million Series B in 2018 led by C5 Capital, with participation from ForgePoint Capital and Kleiner Perkins, and touted customers like media and financial giant Thomson Reuters. IronNet also received $5.6 million in federal loans granted to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the company failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021 and its stock price continued to decline following an initial spike. By the following year, IronNet had fewer than 100 corporate customers. IronNet also cut 17% of its workforce this June. Alexander served as IronNet CEO until July, when he was replaced by Linda Zecher, the chairperson of IronNets largest investor C5 Capital as part of the investment firms effort to rescue the company. C5 Capital, which did not return a request for comment, injected more than $1.3 million into IronNet last month to stave off its eventual collapse. Investors at Forgepoint Capital and Kleiner Perkins did not return TechCrunchs requests for comment about IronNets bankruptcy. In its Friday filing, IronNet said it expects that no distributions would be available for stockholders. Alexander, who remains chair of IronNets board, also serves on the board of SolCyber.

        "Extracted Article": "Epic Games is laying off 16% of its employees, impacting about 870 people, the Fortnite maker announced on Thursday. The company also announced that its divesting Bandcamp, an online audio distribution platform it acquired last year, and spinning off most of SuperAwesome, a kid-safe technology developer that it acquired in 2020. The layoffs news was first reported by Bloomberg. For a while now, weve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in a memo to employees. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic. Sweeney went on to note that the company had been making ongoing efforts to reduce costs, including moving to net zero hiring and cutting operating spend on things like marketing and events. Despite these efforts, the company ended up far short of financial sustainability and Epic concluded that layoffs were the next logical step. Sweeney says that conducting the layoffs now and on this scale will stabilize the companys finances. As for Bandcamp and SuperAwesome, Bandcamp is joining Songtradr, a music marketplace company, while SuperAwesome’s advertising business will now be spun out as an independent company under the SuperAwesome brand, led by its current CEO Kate O’Loughlin. Were cutting costs without breaking development or our core lines of businesses so we can continue to focus on our ambitious plans, Sweeney wrote. About two-thirds of the layoffs were in teams outside of core development. Some of our products and initiatives will land on schedule, and some may not ship when planned because they are under-resourced for the time being. We’re ok with the schedule tradeoff if it means holding on to our ability to achieve our goals, get to the other side of profitability and become a leading metaverse company. The company says its focused on shipping its most successful initiatives, which includes the next Fortnite Season and Fortnite Chapter 5, Del Mar, Sparks and Juno. Epic says its release schedules for these projects remain unchanged. The news comes as Epic announced today that Fortnite V-Bucks will increase in price in the United States and several other countries on October 27. In the blog post, the company explained that the price increase of around 12% to 15% per bundle is due to economic factors such as inflation and currency fluctuations. The layoffs also come as Epic filed a cert petition with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking the court to reexamine a 2021 ruling over Apple’s App Store policies. If the Supreme Court decides to hear the case, it would reopen a legal battle between Epic and Apple that began back in August 2020. In todays newsroom post, Epic notes that its been taking steps to reduce our legal expenses, but are continuing the fight against Apple and Google distribution monopolies and taxes, so the metaverse can thrive and bring opportunity to Epic and all other developers. Epic asks the Supreme Court to weigh in on its beef with Apple",

        "Extracted Article": "Talkdesk, a company once valued at $10 billion that sells software to help large corporations improve customer service, has laid off more employees — the third round of cuts in less than 14 months. A Talkdesk spokesperson confirmed Tuesday via email that it had made “limited headcount reductions in a few areas.” She declined to share how many people were affected by the latest round of cuts. The 12-year-old San Francisco-based company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer service for midmarket and enterprise businesses. At the time of its last raise, it counted more than 1,800 companies as customers, including IBM, Acxiom, Trivago and Fujitsu. The company has made several cuts in the past 14 months in an effort to cut costs on lower revenue projections, according to one source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Talkdesk reportedly laid off staff in February of this year and in August 2022, when it had about 2,100 employees. It’s unclear as to how many workers remain. CEO Tiago Paiva said in an emailed statement that the limited cuts would not negatively affect the company. “Investments and advancements we’ve made in AI position us at the forefront of CX innovation, enabling a leaner, more agile global organization, Paiva said. The limited headcount reductions we made in a few areas will not negatively impact our speed of innovation. We will continue to invest in and hire in strategic areas that allow us to innovate faster and more efficiently, at scale. As one example, we are evolving our location strategy. With our recent FedRAMP In Process designation, and success in healthcare and regulated industries, we are increasing R&amp;D investments in the U.S. Our business remains strong, and we have a tremendous market opportunity ahead of us.” Talkdesk raised $230 million in Series D funding in August 2021, which more than tripled its valuation to $10 billion. Update on September 27: An affected employee confirmed that at least 140 people, if not more, were impacted by the latest round of layoffs many of whom are located in Portugal. Portuguese publication Observador reported that: Employees are being proposed to sign a termination by mutual agreement — which, in the eyes of the law, would not be a dismissal and, consequently, would not guarantee access to unemployment benefit. The proposal will have been presented this Monday and a deadline will have been set until this Friday, September 29th, to communicate the decision to the company.",

        "Extracted Article": "Roblox, the community-focused gaming platform popular amongst kids, has downsized a substantial portion of its talent acquisition team, signaling a shift in the companys focus from expansion to the bottom line. In a statement to TechCrunch, Roblox confirmed that about 30 employees in its talent acquisition organization were let go on Monday. No other teams are impacted. The aggressive growth targets Roblox was operating against in the past few years required a heavier investment in our TA organization, said a Roblox spokesperson. With our commitment to getting our cash compensation growth in line with our bookings growth by the end of Q1 2024, we now need a smaller Talent Acquisition organization to meet our adjusted hiring needs. This action is the result of the reduction in our hiring targets to better align with our growth goals. There were hints that the hiring slowdown was on the cards as part of its ongoing effort to cut costs. As Robloxs chief financial officer, Michael Guthrie shared on the firms recent Q2 earnings call: We will see leverage against pretty much all of the cost areas over the next 12 months. We think well see a little bit of leverage in cost of goods sold because weve slowed down hiring, leverage against our compensation expenses because infra, trust and safety, we slowed down a little bit there. Weve already closed the gap pretty meaningfully on both of those two. The company has undergone a period of rosy growth in the last few years, nearly tripling its daily active users from Q1 2020 to 66 million early this year. As its business balloons, its spending more on compensating developers. Developer exchange fees, which comprise the sum Roblox pays to creators who cash out the in-game currencies earned, amounted to $348 million in the first six months ended June 2023, compared to $290 million a year before. Despite growth in user numbers and hours spent on the platform, users arent spending more. Average bookings per DAU from the second quarter was $11.92, down 3% year-over-year. Roblox remains unprofitable, posting a net loss of $282.8 million in Q2 2023, up from $176.4 million the previous year. Robloxs operation in China, a joint venture it set up with Tencent in 2019, appears unaffected by this round of layoffs. Former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar joins Robloxs board",

        "Extracted Article": "Divvy Homes, the rent-to-own startup that gained attention and investment from Tiger Global and other high-profile investors, is laying off 94 employees. The layoffs — its third round in the past year — represents the latest blow to the real estate tech company, as mortgage interest rates have continued to surge. The 94 employees are spread across the United States, with some based in the company’s San Francisco headquarters as well as remote employees in other locations such as Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Texas and Washington, according to a September 7 letter that Divvy Homes head of talent Rachel Ergmann sent to Oregon’s Office of Workforce Investments. The job cuts affect people working in a wide range of roles, including the vice presidents of sales, compliance, people and comms/PR, as well as a senior recruiter, a number of software engineers and account executives. The terminations will take effect as of November 7. Its not known how many employees remain at the company. A source familiar with internal happenings at Divvy said the most recent round of layoffs made up almost half the company. Doing the math, that means it likely had just under 200 employees prior to the cuts. TechCrunch reached out to Divvy Homes for additional details but had not heard back at the time of writing. The source added: The layoffs were attributed to the macroeconomic climate, the current cost of capital, and the need to conserve cash. The economics of the company dont work when interest rates are this high, and its likely the company wont be close to fully operational until interest rates go down. Divvy laid off in February an unknown number of people, including the company’s head of growth marketing, according to real estate publication Inman. That followed a September 2022 layoff of about 40 people, or some 12% of its workforce at the time, as reported by Inman. Innovative model gone wrong? In its heyday, Divvy Homes claimed to be different from other real estate tech companies because it worked with renters who wanted to become homeowners by buying the home they wanted and renting it back to them for three years “while [they build] the savings needed to own it themselves.” The once-buzzy startup has raised more than $700 million in debt and equity from well-known investors such as Tiger Global Management, GGV Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), among others. Divvys last known funding occurred in August 2021 a $200 million Series D funding led by Tiger Global Management and Caffeinated Capital at a $2 billion valuation. The Series D round was announced just six months after a $110 million Series C. Divvy Homes last known valuation was $2.3 billion in 2021, according to PitchBook. Mortgage rates dropped to historic lows in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. But since March 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on a mission to curb inflation, interest rates have soared. According to The Mortgage Reports, “mortgage rates entered August below 7%, but by the end of the month, they had soared to 7.23%, a level not seen in over two decades, according to Freddie Mac’s records.” By last week, they had jumped even higher with the average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages climbing to 7.42%, according to Bankrate. For companies like Divvy Homes, which purchased homes as part of its business model, the rise has been devastating limiting its ability to purchase homes and make money off those buys. The company also made headlines in October 2022 when Fast Company analyzed rents advertised by Divvy and determined that the company charged higher rents than other landlords in some markets, had ramped up evictions of clients and “could be slow to make repairs,” as reported by Inman.

        "Extracted Article": "Sensor Tower, a prominent market intelligence firm for the app economy, this week laid off a notable portion of its workforce, estimated at around 40 people out of the 270+ at the company, according to LinkedIns headcount. The layoffs included C-suite executives, TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources, including the CMO, CFO and more. Other teams impacted include finance and nearly all of marketing, were hearing. The company held an all-hands meeting to address the changes, which may still be underway as part of a larger reorg of Sensor Towers corporate structure. Sensor Tower confirmed the layoffs, but not the particulars, noting it would issue a fuller release next week. Earlier this week, Sensor Tower’s management team took necessary steps to reorganize and right-size our business under a talented and experienced senior leadership team, said Melissa Sheer, a publicist for Sensor Tower, in an emailed statement provided to TechCrunch. We are excited about these changes as we position the company for a balance of continued growth and best-in-class profitability. We will provide more details in the coming days, she said. A popular provider of third-party data and insights for app developers, brands, marketers and publishers, Sensor Tower has grown its headcount over the years following its $45 million investment in 2020 from Riverwood Capital. The firm at the time cited 350 enterprise-level customers, such as Morgan Stanley, Zynga and Tencent. But Sensor Tower was still a small team then just 75 employees only a bit larger than the number of employees laid off this week. Sensor Tower grew again in 2021 with its acquisition of market intelligence company Pathmatics, which allowed it to offer an expanded set of digital and mobile advertising insights. The deal included an undisclosed growth investment from Riverwood Capital into Pathmatics. The company had then claimed it chose to raise more funds to further grow its business with investments in hiring, marketing and infrastructure, but noted it had been profitable since its launch. Today, Sensor Towers website touts its use by top brands, firms and marketers, like Dyson, LOréal, Target, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Welchs, Petco, Chanel, Revolut, Getir, Warner Bros., Hershey, Wieden + Kennedy, ByteDance, Activision Blizzard, Allstate, Apple, Purina, Pepsico, Nike and more. Its data is regularly cited by top publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, CNBC, The New York Times, Bloomberg and others, including TechCrunch. Unfortunately, 2023 has been a tough year for layoffs, which have ranged from big names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, Zoom, Roku, Spotify and Shopify, to smaller startups across all sectors, including crypto, SaaS, enterprise, consumer and more. Update, 11/22/23, 3:30PM ET: Sensor Tower tells us the CPO was not impacted by the layoffs. We have removed the reference.

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity giant Malwarebytes this week laid off 100 employees as it prepares for a major restructuring that will see the business split into two, TechCrunch has learned. The layoffs come almost exactly a year after Malwarebytes eliminated 14% of its global workforce. A former employee who asked not to be named told TechCrunch that the layoffs come just weeks after the company’s chief product officer, chief information officer and chief technology officer were let go. An archived version of the Malwarebytes leadership page shows that these positions no longer exist at the company. Multiple posts on LinkedIn showed that a number of additional employees were laid off this week. One former Malwarebytes employee described the layoffs as “an unfortunate annual tradition.” Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski confirmed to TechCrunch that approximately 100 to 110 employees were let go this week, with the layoffs affecting predominantly corporate employees. Kleczynski also confirmed the company had made leadership changes as part of the “strategic reorganization.” Kleczynski said the layoffs were part of a plan to separate the company into two separate business units, but denied that it planned to sell any part of the business. The split — which was not previously made public — will see Malwarebytes separate its consumer and corporate-facing business units. The consumer business will focus on tools such as identity protection and VPN, while the remaining business will focus on enterprise-facing software like managed and endpoint detection, Kleczynski tells TechCrunch. Full details of the split have not yet been finalized but will be announced in the coming weeks. Kleczynski tells TechCrunch that the latest round layoffs, which affected Malwarebytes employees globally, were an exercise in rationalizing expenditures. Kleczynski said Malwarebytes continues to be “healthy and profitable.” “A profitable business is a viable business.” Kleczynski said. Malwarebytes isn’t the only cybersecurity company to make layoffs in recent months. Earlier this month, SecureWorks announced plans to let go of 15% of its workforce in order to deliver “profitable growth,” and Rapid7 also confirmed it was laying off 18% of its global workforce, affecting more than 400 employees. https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/tech-industry-layoffs-2023/",

In a regulatory filing, SecureWorks said that it would incur about $14.2 million in expenses due to the layoffs, mostly related to employee termination benefits and real-estate costs. SecureWorks chief executive Wendy Thomas cited the need to simplify and scale our business and to deliver profitable growth in an all-hands company email to employees justifying the cuts. The company announced an earlier 9% workforce reduction in February, as it aimed to prioritize its higher margin Tageis cloud security products. The company said in a filing at the time it had 2,149 full-time employees globally. That puts the number of affected employees at around 300 for this round of layoffs.

        "Extracted Article": "Sendy, a Kenyan logistics startup that enabled retailers to purchase FMCGs directly from manufacturers, among other services, is shutting down its operations and exploring a sale of its assets, TechCrunch has learned. Meshack Alloys, Sendy co-founder, confirmed the sale to TechCrunch without offering more details, saying: “We are in the middle of an acquisition process. So yes, Sendy is being acquired. We will issue a formal joint statement in two weeks or so time. In the meantime, we are unable to comment on further details at this time.” According to several sources, the company ran out of funds two months ago and had been scrambling to cut costs for the past year to remain afloat. Last July, it announced a 10% cut of its workforce, which Alloys noted was in response to the “current realities impacting tech companies globally.” Since then, however, Sendy’s workforce has been pruned further in more cost-cutting measures (shuttering a product line and exiting a market). Last October, the Kenyan startup laid off 54 employees and wound down its supply service and this February, it exited its end-to-end fulfillment offering in Nigeria, a market it entered two years ago. Sendy’s struggles marked the latest setback for a crop of B2B e-commerce companies that enjoyed a fine run, raising millions of dollars and ballooning in value, but have since run into operational costs and marginal customer pricing problems. The startup had targeted to raise $100 million last year but only got a fraction of the funding from MOL PLUS, the corporate venture capital of Japanese transport company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. Since the deal, Sendy has been exploring other options to shore up its business these past few months, including seeking fresh capital and a buyer, three people familiar with the matter said. But that hasn’t come easy. The Kenyan startup, valued at over $80 million late last year, was in talks with several investors to raise additional capital a few months back but at a lower valuation of $40 million to $60 million. However, one of its key investors backed out of the transaction, leaving Sendy short on funds for the last two to three months, including funds to cover salaries it is now attempting to sell some of its assets, the people said. Kenyan logistics startup Sendy raises $20M round backed by Toyota Furthermore, the pool of potential buyers is small. According to people familiar with the company’s dealings, Sendy is in talks with other African companies in the B2B e-commerce and trucking space, including Trella, Sabi, Wasoko, and one of its investors, to sell some of its assets, including tech and fulfillment operations. It’s unclear if any of the talks have resulted in a deal, and discussions on various options could still be ongoing, including an acquisition, as claimed by the startup. Over 200 employees are set to be affected by the closure. Sendy was co-founded in 2015 by Alloys, Evanson Biwott, Don Okoth and Malaika Judd. It has raised $26.5 million in disclosed funding from several investors, including Toyota Tsusho, Atlantica Ventures, VestedWorld, Keppel Capital, Enza Capital, AAICA Investment Pte Ltd, Sunu Capital and Goodwill Investments.",

        "Extracted Article": "Astra has laid off 25% of its workforce since the beginning of the quarter and is reallocating at least 50 engineers and manufacturing staff away from its launch business to focus on spacecraft production, the company said Friday. The reallocation and layoffs are expected to delay testing of the under-development Rocket 4 and Launch System 2.0, Astra said. The affected employees worked in the company’s launch, sales and administration and “shared services” departments. Workforce reductions are expected to save the company more than $4 million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Astra, which is facing dwindling cash reserves, is no doubt looking for a way to further reduce operating expenses while also bolstering its spacecraft engine business, the only business unit that currently has a near-term chance of generating revenue. The spacecraft engine technology is sourced from Astra’s acquisition of propulsion developer Apollo Fusion, which closed the day Astra went public in July 2021. Indeed, Astra said that it had closed 278 committed orders of the Astra Spacecraft Engine product through the end of March, which totals around $77 million in contracts once the engines are delivered. A “substantial majority” of these orders will be delivered through the end of 2024, the company said. “We are intensely focused on delivering on our commitments to our customers, which includes ensuring we have sufficient resources and an adequate financial runway to execute on our near-term opportunities,” Chris Kemp, CEO and founder, said in a statement. Astra also said that it had engaged investment bank PJT Partners as a financial advisor as it looks for more capital to continue operations. That includes “potential strategic investments in the Astra Spacecraft Engine business to strengthen Astra’s balance sheet,” the company said. Separately, Astra said it had raised $10.8 million in a debt sale to investment group High Trail Capital. According to preliminary second-quarter financial results, Astra is expected to have revenues between $0.5-$1 million, while having just $26-$26.5 million in cash on hand. This is not the first time major layoffs have hit the space company. Last November, Astra announced it had let go of 16% of its employees, also to focus on launch and spacecraft engines.",

With a total headcount of about 900 employees, it represents approximately 90 people. The company says it looks to become more efficient and be better positioned for a public listing amid the ongoing slowdown in the market. The San Diego-based startup notified some of its affected employees about layoffs last Thursday, TechCrunch learned and later confirmed through an email. Other employees impacted by the job-cut decision will transition out over the next few months. People affected included those from the software engineering division as well as customer service and support teams. We made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our workforce, primarily to move a portion of our support roles to lower-cost regions, said Zeb Evans, founder and CEO of ClickUp, in a statement to TechCrunch. This realignment enables us to be a best-in-class IPO-ready company in efficiency while continuing to overachieve in growth. Impacted employees will receive a severance package lasting 12 weeks, six months of insurance coverage and six months of access to the startups employee assistance program. In addition, the startup has allowed the laid-off employees to retain their laptops and equipment and has extended support to those on a visa. In 2022, ClickUp laid off 7% of its staff as a part of its restructuring. At the time, as reported by Protocol, a ClickUp spokesperson described the move as a one-time decision to stay on track toward profitability. ClickUp names Booking.com, IBM, Spotify, T-Mobile and Netflix among its customers. It provides a unified platform for document collaboration, project management, spreadsheets and chat. The startup also recently followed in big tech companies footsteps and introduced its AI-based assisting solution. Founded by Zeb Evans and Alex Yurkowski in 2017, ClickUp raised $400 million in a Series C funding round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global at a post-money valuation of $4 billion. The startup also includes Lightspeed Venture Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, Craft Ventures and Georgian Partners among its investors. We are very grateful for the contributions of the employees who have been impacted and are committed to supporting them throughout this transition. At the same time, we will continue to hire for roles aligned with our mission, especially those geared towards product and revenue, the CEO said.",

Todays move comes as the company started to close operations of its automotive business unit Olx Autos in some markets after long exploring potential buyers and investors, TechCrunch learned and as confirmed by the company. The Amsterdam-headquartered company, which is operating in over 30 countries around the world, recently started informing the affected employees about the layoffs. They are not limited to a particular market or division, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. An Olx spokesperson confirmed the job cuts to TechCrunch and said it resulted from the decision to exit Olx Autos that was announced in March. Earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to exit the Olx Autos business and potential buyers or investors have been explored since then, the company said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. As a result of this process, it became clear that pursuing individual country sales was the best option, given the significant value that exists within local markets. This includes Chile, the financing business in Latin America, and both the Olx classifieds platforms and the Autos transaction businesses in India, Indonesia and Turkey. But Olx Group couldnt find potential buyers or investors in other markets, meaning that the company has shut down its operations in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. Although Olx Autos will continue to sell vehicles in these markets, the company will not be accepting any new transactions, as stated on the Olx Argentina website. As for other markets, its unclear whats going to happen next. We are committed to supporting all impacted people throughout this transition, the company said. Olx did not confirm whether the move impacted any C-level officers. It also did not immediately respond to a query about its headcount following the latest round of layoffs. In its annual report for the year ending on March 31, 2022, Prosus said its classifieds business — predominantly Olx — had 11,375 employees globally. The new job cuts notably come just months after Olx confirmed plans to decrease its global workforce by 15% (1,500 jobs) in January. In November, Prosus reported that Olx Autos saw 84% growth in revenue, reaching a significant milestone of $1 billion during the first half of its 2022 financial year. However, the automotive business has not yet achieved profitability.",

Tada has not yet said how many staff it will lay off since its part of a voluntary early retirement program, a spokesperson at VCNC said, adding that it will be able to announce more concrete details in the not-too-distant future. Tada is said to cut at least 50% of its staff, or about 45 people, per local media outlets. Socar and Viva Republica, which operates Korean financial super app Toss, own Tada. This news comes almost 10 months after Socars IPO in 2022 and the recent breakdown of merger talks between Viva Republica and Jinmobility, a Korean ride-hailing company that operates i.M. Back in 2021, Viva Republica acquired a 60% stake in Tada for an undisclosed amount with an ambition to integrate it with its payment service. Viva Republica reportedly continues to have discussions with potential strategic partners for Tada to stay in business after merger talks with Jinmobility fell apart. The Korean fintech firm is looking for a variety of routes for Tada, the spokesperson told TechCrunch without providing further details. Viva Republica declined to comment. In South Korea, Kakaos car-hailing unit, Kakao Mobility, has the largest market share, with more than 90% in 2021, according to Koreas Fair Trade Commission. UT Taxi, a joint venture company backed by Uber Technologies and TMap Mobility, is another player in the car-hailing space in the country.",

        "Extracted Article": "TrueCar, a platform where people can research new and used car prices and find local dealer savings, is laying off 24% of staff due to a restructure, the company said Wednesday. About 102 people will be impacted by the layoff. President and CEO Michael Darrow is stepping aside both from his executive roles to be replaced by Jantoon Reigersman and his position on the board. Reigersman previously served as TrueCars chief operating officer and chief financial officer. TrueCars stock jumped nearly 13% in after-hours trading on the news. The restructuring announced today better aligns our cost structure with our revenue base and is designed to make TrueCar a nimbler, more efficient company, said Barbara Carbone, incoming chair of the board, in a statement. We made this difficult decision after an extensive review and believe that it is necessary to enable TrueCar to achieve its strategic priorities and create long-term shareholder value. TrueCar says the restructure should result in nonrecurring cash payments of about $7 million, which will show up in the second and third quarters of 2023, and an annualized reduction in expensive exclusive of stock-based compensation of over $20 million. As of May 31, 2023, TrueCar had cash and cash equivalents of $146.5 million. The company expects that number to drop below $125 million in the near term, but says it continues to anticipate break-even or positive adjusted EBITDA and double digit year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. TrueCars first-quarter earnings also show a dip in revenue and increase in cost. The company closed Q1 with nearly $37 million, down from $43.5 million in the same period last year. Net loss hit $19.5 million, up from $12.4 in Q1 2022. TrueCar was founded in 2005 with a goal of revolutionizing the car-buying process by making it more transparent and efficient. The company officially launched at TechCrunch50 back in 2008, a now-ended pitch competition during which judges found TrueCars commitment to providing users with the actual price paid for specific vehicles in a given area compelling. TrueCar ran up against challenges in 2012 as dealerships were threatened by the companys model, even facing legal issues in states like California due to allegations of operating as a dealer without a license. The company continued to expand regardless, acquiring new businesses along the way, and went public in 2014 under the ticker TRUE. TrueCar was also sued by the California New Car Dealers Association in 2015 for allegedly violating California law with its billing model. TrueCar settled in 2017 and agreed to modify its billing model in the state. Carvana crashes back down to earth",

We regret to inform you that Tiki will be shutting down its operations. As of 11.59 PM India time, June 27, 2023, all Tiki functions and services will cease, wrote Tiki in a post. The demise of Tiki, which featured original and local-focused videos, comes as a surprise, as it maintained some 35 million monthly active users in India, its only operational market, according to data from Sensor Tower (shared by an industry executive). The Singapore-headquartered Tiki launched in India immediately after New Delhi banned TikTok. It remains a mystery how the video app, which was owned by an entity called Dol Technologies, was bankrolled. Many industry executives told TechCrunch that they believed that the firm was a loose subsidiary of one of the Chinese video apps that got nuked by New Delhi in mid-2020. The recent challenges faced by the tech industry have led to the closure of numerous startups, a post on Tikis social media accounts said. Despite being a small startup operating in Singapore and India, Tiki has always stood for being a place for real talents, said the post, signed by Team Tiki. The end of Tiki comes at a time when Indias short video market is seeing rapid consolidation and exits. Times Internet sold MX Players short video business to ShareChat last year, whereas Xiaomi shut its short video offering Zili earlier this month in the country.",

At least 14 people have been laid off from rocket engine startup Ursa Major, with one person citing budgetary constraints as the reason for being let go, according to posts on LinkedIn. Ursa Major did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s inquiry into the layoffs, or the number of people affected. According to LinkedIn, 292 people are listed as currently working at Ursa Major. This makes Ursa Major the latest company to be hit by major market headwinds that have affected some of the biggest names in technology. Among those laid off include engineers working in propulsion, the companys bread-and-butter, and quality analysis. Ursa Major is a Berthoud, Colorado-based startup developing liquid engines for rocket and hypersonic applications. The company is developing a 5,000-pound thrust Hadley engine and a 50,000-pound thrust engine called Ripley. Just recently, the company announced an “eight-figure” contract to further the development of two new engines: a Draper engine for hypersonic and a 200,000-pound thrust Arroway engine. In April, the company also announced that it would supply the upper-stage engine for Astra Space’s in-development Rocket 4.

        "Extracted Article": "Taxfix leaped to a $1 billion valuation in 2022 on the back of a popular mobile app used by consumers to help with tax returns. But fast-forward to 2023, and the Berlin-based accounting startup is taking an audit of its own affairs. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Taxfix has laid off 20% of its staff 120 employees as part of wider restructuring of the business aimed at cutting costs. The cuts were announced to staff on Tuesday. Pointedly, they are coming in the wake of Taxfix acquiring a rival tax startup in the country, Stuttgart-based tax chatbot Steuerbot a deal that was announced two months ago. With Taxfix’s recent successful acquisition of Steuerbot, great synergies are created, which enable us to heavily increase efficiencies. Therefore we took the strategic decision to restructure the organization, a Taxfix spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Taxfix originally said it would operate Steuerbot as an independent and complementary subsidiary. Taxfix had also been actively recruiting just prior to todays news; now it no longer lists open positions at the company on its own careers page so it appears that hiring is also frozen. The sudden changes underscore the pressure that startups are under in the current market. The most promising of them will have raised big rounds in years past at top valuations to stay in so-called growth mode intentionally remaining unprofitable and investing capital in their market and technology expansion. But now, with the funding landscape dried up, many of the same startups are being expected to pursue a variety of other courses: conserve the cash they have, cut costs where they can, be prepared to take hits on their valuations if they do need to raise (especially if theyre not tightening their belts), and aim for profitability all boxes that Taxfix is now aiming to check. The macroeconomic funding environment has changed over the past months, and it is, therefore, more important than ever to position ourselves as an independent company for the long term. This entails an even stronger focus of the business activities on sustainable growth and profitability, the spokesperson said. Taxfix did not comment on its current runway, nor whether it is currently trying to raise more money. The last funding the startup raised was just over a year ago, in April 2022, when it closed a $220 million Series D at a valuation of over $1 billion, from an impressive group of investors that included Teachers’ Venture Growth of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, Index Ventures, Valar Ventures, Creandum and Redalpine. In more heady times, you might have expected Taxfix to follow the route of other high-flying unicorns: By now it would have scooped up yet more investors and capital at an even higher valuation to break into more markets and accounting categories. But these days, sounds like theres a lot riding on just keeping things operating steadily on its own steam.",

        "Extracted Article": "Daylight, an LGBTQ+ banking platform, is shutting down. Its operations will cease on June 30, according to embattled co-founder and CEO Rob Curtis. The announcement comes months after NY Magazine published an explosive feature on the neobank. The article honed in on Daylight, whose seed and Series A fundraises TechCrunch had covered here and here, respectively. NY Mags piece detailed a lawsuit brought on by three former employees as well as alleged fabrications and inappropriate behavior on the part of Curtis. In a blog published today, Curtis said he felt like “now is the right time to exit this market” and told customers that their “money is safe and will be fully accessible for transfer through 30 June.” He added: “Daylight had a great run paving the way for US LGBTQ+ customers — we opened thousands of trans-inclusive debit accounts, supported thousands of prospective LGBTQ+ parents’ plans for their families. Ultimately, though, we couldn’t provide these services in a way that covered our costs — this is likely a job for big banks and I hope they pick up the torch and carry forward our legacy.” Founded in 2020, Daylight raised a total of $20 million in funding. Anthemis Group led its $15 million Series A in 2022. Other backers include Kapor Capital, Precursor Capital, Clocktower, Financial Venture Studio and Citi. Soon after covering the shocking allegations, the company reached out to TechCrunch with a statement from Curtis, who struck back at former employees. Essentially, Curtis said the company “regretted” that “some former employees felt disappointed” that the company “would not go beyond the scope” of its mission and invest its “resources in addressing systemic, societal issues affecting LGBTQ+ people.” He added: “We’re equally sad that we could not meet their personal expectations of start-up culture and continue to wish them the best in the future.” The former employees alleged age and wage discrimination, whistleblower retaliation and fraud. For example, Terrance Knox who is Black claimed to have made $85,000 less than his white peers. The lawsuit also alleges that Curtis made up a projection that Daylight would process $500 million in transactions by the end of 2023. The CEO told TechCrunch that the former employees claims were fabricated, adding: We disagree wholeheartedly with their negative characterization of our business, and Daylight is fully prepared to address these concerns in court.” At the time of its seed raise, the company said its products were designed to promote financial equality and inclusion for the estimated 30-million-plus Americans who identify as LGBTQ+. The startup also planned to build out a LGBTQ+ business marketplace and a platform that offered discounts and rewards when members shop at merchants whose actions support the queer community.

All of the layoffs will occur in TuSimples U.S. workforce. “Prior to the layoff, TuSimple had about 550 employees in the U.S. and post reduction in force the company will have about 220, according to the company. We believe this is the right number of employees to work toward achieving our goals while preserving the cash on our balance sheet as well as retain strong publicly listed company capabilities,” according to an emailed statement from TuSimple. The announcement early Thursday comes a week after the company disclosed that it received a delisting notice from the Nasdaq for failing to file its quarterly report on time. TuSimple hasn’t filed a quarterly report for the fourth quarter or full-year results. It last reported earnings for the quarter ended September 30. It also said Thursday it will not be able to file first-quarter earnings in a timely manner. Shares were up more than 14% following the disclosure. TuSimple was supposed to be delisted May 15, but was able to get a temporary reprieve from Nasdag as a panel at the exchange reviews its case. This is the second restructuring in five months. TuSimple laid off 25% of its workforce in December, a couple of weeks after the companys deal to co-develop purpose-built autonomous semi trucks with Navistar fell apart. The company also said Thursday that it plans to keep its Chinese-based subsidiaries and is no longer exploring a sale. TuSimple noted that these subsidiaries have continued to make progress working with several OEMs on Level 4 and Level 2+ commercial projects. Its unclear if keeping the Chinese parts of the company will threaten its standing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The company was reportedly planning to sell its China subsidiary due to tight regulations and scrutiny in both countries. However, selling its Asia-Pacific (APAC) subsidiaries was never a CFIUS imposed requirement, TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu told TechCrunch. As management, in 2022, we felt the APAC operations were not being fully valued by the market and we understand the geopolitical sensitivity of having operations in both the U.S. and China in todays environment. So we started a divestment exploration process, Lu said, adding that APAC operations have continued to make significant commercial progress and the company believes its best interest to no longer explore a divestment.

Earlier this week, Nuro co-founders Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu explained in a blog post that the company would cut staff and shift resources away from commercial operations and toward R&amp;D. Nuro will pause plans to ramp up commercial operations this year and delay volume production of its Nuro bot — the third-generation, or R3, delivery robot designed to be the flagship of its commercial strategy. Nuro will be able to operate twice as long by making these changes, giving it enough capital to operate another three years without raising more money, according to Ferguson and Zhu.

The layoffs come just a few days after the company threw a party at the cybersecurity conference RSA, where the company apparently served branded drinks that it called “cyber soup.” Bishop Fox’s official Twitter account said last week that the company will have “other events in Vegas later this year,” referring to the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences held every year in Las Vegas. Bishop Fox spokesperson Kevin Kosh said in an email that the company had an event space at RSA “reserved many months in advance and was primarily secured for the purposes of the day-long livestream (mirroring the one we did for DefCon), which was a forum to engage, and share knowledge with the larger community. The reception followed that for the participants, team, industry friends and RSA attendees.” The company declined to say how much it spent on the RSA party. Kosh confirmed that the company had around 400 employees before the layoffs yesterday. Last night was so much fun!

While demand for our solutions remains solid and our business is stable, we can’t ignore the market uncertainty and investment trends in this very different global economy,” Bishop Fox CEO Vinnie Liu said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “Bishop Fox remains healthy, and we continue to be bullish about our growth and technology investments over the coming quarters and years. Our firm’s cash reserves (including our Series B raise), combined with this restructuring, allow us to maintain a strong financial position that enables scale, innovation, and of course, delivery of the high-quality solutions our customers have come to expect.” Last year, Bishop Fox raised a total of $129 million in a Series B round from several investors, including WestCap, NextEquity Partners and Rockpool Capital. And last week, the company announced at RSA that it was expanding to the U.K. with “an initial focus on organizations in Northern Europe.” In the announcement, the company also said that it had “a 40% year-over-year company growth.” Employees who said they lost their job on Twitter called the layoffs “unexpected.” One of them said it was “due to internal restructuring.” In September 2022, the company’s vice president of customer success Christie Terrill said the company was “hiring across the board,” and the company’s official LinkedIn account wrote in a post that it was “hiring across several different teams in the Fox Den, from pentesting to technical editing to sales.” The layoffs at Bishop Fox come as the whole tech sector is suffering from the economic downturn. Still, some considered cybersecurity to be a safer sector. Last year, a report from (ISC)², a nonprofit association for “information security leaders,” predicted that cybersecurity teams “will be the least affected by staff reductions, as organizations anticipate an increase in cyber threats in 2023.” The report was based on a poll of 1,000 C-suite executives. At the time, (ISC)² chief executive Clar Rosso said that “the importance placed on cybersecurity professionals, even during uncertain economic times, suggests that top executives understand the critical need for a strong cybersecurity team now more than ever.” Do you have more information about the layoffs at Bishop Fox?

        "Extracted Article": "Poparazzi, the once-hot photo-sharing app that hit the top of the App Store in 2021, is shutting down. The company announced the news via a Medium blog late last week, informing users that the app would be discontinued and users had until June 30, 2023 to download their content. Last year, Poparazzis founders at TTYL Inc. said the app had grown to 5+ million total installs and confirmed its raise of $15 million in Series A funding. Though Poparazzi had felt at the time like an overnight sensation, co-founder and CEO Alex Ma and his brother, co-founder Austen Ma, had spent three years developing apps and pivoting to achieve the success they generated with Poparrazis launch. In a 2022 interview with TechCrunch, Alex said Poparrazi was actually the 11th or 12th app that was generated by those efforts. Among those was the audio social network, TTYL, a sort of “Clubhouse for friends, which their company is also named for. Poparrazi, however, generated a lot of hype soon after its release, climbing the charts to reach No. 1 on the App Store. The concept behind the app was a photo-sharing-focused social network that essentially took Instagrams tagging feature and turned it into the entire experience. On Poparazzi, users could tag their friends but couldnt post photos of their own. The idea was that this would create a more authentic type of social network, as photos wouldnt necessarily be the polished, perfected images that fill Instagram, but rather the casual moments that make up peoples real lives. Image Credits: Poparazzi Last June, the company confirmed its $15 million Series A raise led by Benchmarks Sarah Tavel, who beat out a16z for the deal. The startup had previously raised $2 million in seed funding, led by Floodgate, in a round that included other investors like SV Angel, Shrug Capital and various angels. At the time, Poparazzi said its funds would give its team of 15 a runway of over two years. But soon, there were signs that Poparazzis time could be coming to an end. In August 2022, TechCrunch spotted the team was now dabbling with a new app, Made with Friends, that offered a twist on Poparazzi’s original concept of social networking profiles crafted by a user’s friends. Made with Friends instead asked its users to post all sorts of content to their friends profiles, not just photos. For example, they could post text-based content like answers to questions or prompts, as well as videos. The app had been available as a pre-release at that time, but its since been removed from the App Store sometime after March 26 of this year, app intelligence firm Apptopia confirmed to TechCrunch. Usage for Poparrazi had also been slowing post-launch, the firm noted. It estimated there were 6.2 million lifetime installs for the app, but it now has only around 2,000-3,000 monthly active users (MAUs) after reaching a height of 4 million MAUs previously. In its blog post, Poparrazi didnt confirm its future plans, if any, only noting the impending shutdown and thanking its community and supporters. We’ve been incredibly blessed to work with an amazing team of passionate designers, engineers, and marketers to help bring this movement to life. And none of this would have been possible without the backing from the most supportive, world-class group of investors, wrote Alex Ma, in the announcement. To our community, we are so grateful for the support and belief that you have shown us throughout our journey. Your enthusiasm and passion for Poparazzi has been the driving force behind everything we’ve done. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. TTYL Inc. has been asked for comment. Alex Ma responded, after publication, that while the company didn’t have an official statement to share, they could confirm it was winding down and would be returning capital to investors. The team, however, will stay together and work on other projects. Updated 5/1/23, 8:53 pm et with company response.",

        "Extracted Article": "Chief, a professional network designed for women in leadership, has cut 14% of staff, or 43 jobs today, saying in an email seen by TechCrunch that the move is a response to the economy and that the outfit is restructuring to further focus on member experience. The layoff largely hit Chief’s U.S. employees as the business’s newly launched U.K. presence is smaller. Around 262 employees remain at the company. Those who were impacted received at least 12 weeks of severance and continued healthcare insurance. Chief closed its New York office for today as employees process the news. Chief co-founders Lindsay Kaplan and Carolyn Childers wrote the email to staff explaining the decision. Beyond attributing the “challenging macroeconomic environment” that has plagued a vast number of tech startups over the past year, the duo highlighted four priorities for the business going forward: more in-person opportunity, personalization to support members, simplification of the digital experience, and lastly, to continue “to embed diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging into all aspects of the Chief experience.” The last priority that was emphasized by the co-founders — to bring diversity into all of the Chief experience — comes less than one month after the New York Times published a story looking into turmoil at the business over some members perspective that Chief should speak up on social and economic issues that impact marginalized women. Around 33% of Chief’s membership base identifies as coming from a diverse background, down from 35% in October. The company recently hit 20,000 members. At TechCrunch Disrupt last year, Chief’s co-founders spoke to the “extra scrutiny” that mission-oriented companies receive. “For Lindsay and I, that has always just been like, the forefront of everything that we have thought about as we thought about the teams and the culture and what we want to build,” Childers said. “We have actually felt that more because we are a mission-based company, than being women CEOs or founders.” https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/yes-chief-disrupt-2022/?utm_source=internalutm_medium=WPunit Kaplan added that the extra scrutiny “doesn’t feel like a ticking time bomb. It’s us making sure that we’re always walking the walk and practicing what we preach.” Chief clearly wants staff, members and the world to know that it is focused on experience. The workforce reduction comes one week after the business announced that it hired another executive: Sujean Lee, former chief experience officer at HypeBeast, as Chief’s first chief experience officer. The company hit a $1.1 billion valuation in a matter of three years, last raising a $100 million Series B round led by Alphabet’s CapitalG in 2022. Like many others, valuations have been harder and harder to defend as the market worsens. For example, 70% of Chief members see their membership, which costs up to $7,900 annually, paid for by employers. Now those same employers are looking for expenses to cut and are slashing workforces themselves. Chief declined to comment on the layoff and financials beyond the e-mail.",

        "Extracted Article": "Rapid (previously known as RapidAPI), a startup that built out an API marketplace valued at $1 billion last year, is cutting 50% of its staff TechCrunch has learned. According to an email to employees from CEO Marc Friend viewed by TechCrunch, the move is part of “a significant restructuring” in an effort to “right-size the company.” In the email, Friend said that Rapid tried “to compete on too many fronts” as a product company. He added: “We have grown large as an organization and often sacrificed agility. Moving forward, we will be disciplined on our product focus and ruthless about customer success.” Friend only last week took over the role of chief executive of the company. CEO and founder Iddo Gino is now a technical advisor, per a company announcement. The layoffs are believed to have impacted 115 people and are hitting workers across Europe, Tel Aviv and San Francisco, according to a source familiar with internal happenings at the company. The email which went out on Monday said only that a large number of employees would be let go in the next few days. Workers across several departments including sales, talent acquisition, engineering, product and marketing are said to have been affected. The company has confirmed to TechCrunch that it expects to reduce its team size by around 50% and close all open roles, but it declined to confirm the specific number of individuals affected. In a statement via email, a spokesperson said: Following the path of many technology companies recently, our new incoming CEO and the Board have made the difficult decision to implement a restructuring and will be saying goodbye to many of our friends and colleagues. The decision to reduce the number of employees and rebalance investments is one we don’t take lightly. RapidAPI built a platform that helps businesses find and integrate third-party APIs, as well as manage their own usage of their own internal APIs. It raised $150 million in March of 2022 in a Series D round led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. Other backers include Qumra, Andreessen Horowitz, M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund), Viola Growth, Green Bay and Grove Ventures. Last November, RapidAPI announced it had rebranded to Rapid and that more than 4 million developers used its public API hub. That hub, it claimed, had grown to among the world’s largest giving developers the ability to integrate more than 40,000 APIs from companies such as Twilio, Microsoft and Google. At the time, it touted new enterprise customers such as ATA, Poly, Formula 1’s Scuderia AlphaTauri and Sun Life Financial. It also boasted that it had doubled its company employees in the past year to 200. RapidAPI also opened a new European headquarters in Berlin last July.

        "Extracted Article": "Online used vehicle retailer Shift Technologies cut its workforce by 30% in the first quarter as the company sought to reduce costs and eliminate duplicate positions following its merger with CarLotz, CEO Jeff Clementz said during an earnings call. The layoffs came as the company saw its revenue plummet in the fourth quarter and its operating losses expand. Shift closed its merger with CarLotz in December and immediately eliminated duplicate costs and roles, Clementz said during Tuesdays earnings call. In early February, the company decided to exit CarLotzs presence on the East Coast and shut down the Downer Grove, Illinois location in order to focus on core West Coast markets. One remaining CarLotz location in Pomona, California remains open. Shift also has three locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area and Portland. While difficult, we reduced headcount by approximately 30% in the first quarter, Clementz said on the call. In addition to corporate roles, the majority of reductions were due to our move to decentralized sales organization, which occurred in February. He added that the CarLotz integration and strategic moves to rightsize our SG&amp;A are largely behind us. Shift Technologies, which went public in 2020 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, reported it generated $65.6 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, a 67% drop from the same year-ago period. Shift reported an operating loss of $60.7 million in the fourth quarter, a 14% increase from the same period in 2021. Shift did report net income of $13 million in the fourth quarter compared to a net loss of $75.8 million in the same quarter in 2021. However, much of that was due to the one-time gain of $76.7 million from its acquisition of CarLotz. Shift had a net loss of $172 million in 2022, up from the $162.2 million loss it reported the year prior. Notably, the companys gross profit per unit fell 42% between 2021 and 2022 to $1,208 per vehicle. The earnings report caused Shift shares to fall. Share fell nearly 28% on Wednesday to $1.21. However, the share price is still hovering above $1, which has allowed the company to regain the Nasdaq exchange listing requirement.",

        "Extracted Article": "Lucid Group, the U.S. automaker that produces the luxury all-electric Air sedan, is cutting its workforce by 18% as part of a restructuring, the company disclosed in a regulatory filing. The layoffs, which will affect 1,300 employees, will be completed by the end of the second quarter. Lucid expects to incur about $24 million to $30 million in charges connected with its restructuring plan, namely due to severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. The layoffs will be across the organization and will include executive positions. CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson said in an email to workers that the restructuring is the result of its evolving business needs and productivity improvements. He said the move is aligned with a cost-reduction announcement made in late February. While the company has reduced costs, it was not enough to avoid layoffs, according to the email. Consequently, weve made the painful but necessary decision to let some of our talented team members go, Rawlinson wrote, adding that impacted employees will be offered a severance package that includes access to career resources, Lucid-paid healthcare coverage continuation and acceleration of equity. We are also taking continued steps to manage our costs by reviewing all non-critical spending at this time, he wrote. Rawlinson said the decisions are designed to position the company to be more resilient and agile and strengthen the company for the long-term. He also said that Lucid still intends to launch the Gravity SUV in 2024. Last month, Lucid reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings that missed Wall Street expectations. The company also lowered its 2023 annual production target to 10,000 to 14,000, roughly half of the 20,000 to 22,000 deliveries analysts had expected for the year. That was the third time in a year that the company lowered its production goals. In August, Lucid Motors slashed its annual production guidance in half due to what Rawlinson described as “extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges.” Lucid lowered its production guidance from 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles to 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles for 2022. That’s just a quarter of the 20,000 luxury Air sedans the company initially planned to produce in 2022. In February 2022, Lucid adjusted that loftier goal down to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles.",

        "Extracted Article": "Proptech company Roofstock has laid off about 27% of its staff today, according to an email sent to employees that was viewed by TechCrunch. The cuts come just five months after the startup laid off 20% of its workforce. The companys website states that it has 400+ employees, or Roofsters, as theyre dubbed, but it is not known if that figure is current. Roofstock, an online marketplace for investing in leased single-family rental homes, one year ago raised $240 million at a $1.9 billion valuation. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led that financing, which saw participation from existing and new backers including Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and others. Roofstock has raised a total of over $365 million in funding since its 2015 inception, per Crunchbase. According to the email, co-founder and CEO Gary Beasley said today’s reduction in force (RIF) was “in response to the challenging macro environment” and the “negative impact” it is having on Roofstock’s business. He added that the company was not expecting to have to cut more staff so soon, but that it needed to “right size” in an effort “to reduce cash burn rate” and ensure it has “adequate capital runway until the market eventually turns.” Beasley sent the email because apparently the Zoom meeting where the layoff was addressed had “maxed out on attendees.” Oakland, California-based Roofstock lets people buy and sell rental homes in dozens of U.S. markets. The premise behind the company is that both institutional and retail investors can buy and sell homes without forcing renters to leave their homes. Meanwhile, buyers can also presumably generate income from day one. At the time of its fundraise in March 2022, the company said that it had facilitated more than $5 billion in transaction volume, more than half of which had come from the last year alone. Just days before its last round of layoffs last year, Roofstock made headlines for selling its first single-family home using NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Rising mortgage rates and a slowdown in the housing market led to challenges for many real estate technology companies in 2022 that continue this year. Opendoor, Redfin, Compass, Better.com and Homeward are among the other startups that have also laid off workers. IBuyer company Reali last August said it was shutting down, just a year after raising $100 million. TechCrunch has reached out to Roofstock but had not heard back at the time of writing, but multiple sources confirmed that layoffs had taken place today.",

        "Extracted Article": "Course Hero, a tutoring business last valued by investors at $3.6 billion, has cut 15% of staff, or 42 people — its first round of layoffs in 17 years, TechCrunch has learned from numerous sources. A spokesperson confirmed the layoffs, saying that the layoffs are happening as a part of a strategic effort to set Course Hero business line up for future growth. The company says it does not anticipate future layoffs. Part of this transition support includes providing several months of severance, health care benefits through the end of June, outplacement and immigration support services, and we are working with individuals with special circumstances to make sure we do everything we can to ease their transition, a spokesperson said. The workforce reduction comes after Course Hero itself, a rare edtech unicorn, saw co-founder Andrew Grauer leave his post as chief executive four months ago. Course Hero then was put under a parent company, Learneo, which took that multibillion-dollar valuation and named Grauer as CEO. He was succeeded by John Peacock, who was formerly the VP of product at the company. The layoff appears to be one of the new CEO’s first significant changes to the business since taking over. Peacock sent an email to staff this week explaining the changes. “This is the first time in Course Hero’s 17 years that we have done a layoff of this size, and it’s not a decision we made lightly,” the email, obtained by TechCrunch, reads. “It follows careful deliberation with the leadership team about the moment we’re in.” He went on to say that the layoff was done to meet the needs of the “rapidly evolving” sector and that it was “absolutely necessary” for the future of the company. Launched in 2006, Course Hero was somewhat allergic to venture capital until recently. After launching, the company waited eight years to raise a $15 million Series A. Then, after going another nearly six years without raising venture capital, Course Hero closed two financings in 2020. For Course Hero, venture capital was once an unobvious solution Then in 2021, the edtech company announced yet another tranche of capital: a $380 million Series C at a $3.6 billion valuation. It brought a 227.3% increase to Course Hero’s valuation in a little over a year. With fresh capitalization and a broader vision of its total addressable market, the company began scooping up businesses, including Scribbr and LitCharts, a SparkNotes spinoff. It’s unclear how the acquisition cadence will change given today’s scale-back, if at all. The business tells TechCrunch that Course Hero and Learneo are cash-flow positive and profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis.

Klaviyo’s director of public relations, Lacey Berrien, confirmed the workforce reduction over email, adding that their “focus is supporting the departing Klaviyos who made meaningful contributions to the company.” Using publicly available figures on Klaviyo’s staff size, the layoff has impacted roughly 10% of staff. TechCrunch obtained correspondence sent from leadership to impacted employees which stated, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce in an effort to reduce redundancy and recalibrate Klaviyo’s areas of investment for the future. Now, unfortunately, Klaviyo is joining the long list of tech companies that have had mass layoffs in 2023. In January, HubSpot, another Boston-based marketing giant, announced its plans to cut 7% of its workforce. TechCrunch extensively profiled the Boston-based business’ history of growth and goal to rebuild owned marketing outside of the pandemic. The business, at its core, helps other businesses better capture its customer’s cash with email triggers, product recommendations and predictive analytics. To date, it has landed more than 100,000 users, it claims, including the likes of Unilever and Living Proof. The heavily venture-backed business last received a $100 million strategic investment from Shopify, per SEC filings. Months later, the business made its first acquisition ever by scooping up Napkin.io, a tool that gives developers a more seamless way to deploy code from their browsers. Today, though, the picture of clear growth is challenged, or at the very least, set in new context. Its unclear if the company is going to instill a hiring freeze as well, but it still has 65 open job listings on its careers page. https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/tech-industry-layoffs/?utm_source=internalutm_medium=WPunit If you have a juicy tip or lead about happenings in the venture world, you can reach Natasha Mascarenhas on Twitter @nmasc_ or on Signal at +1 925 271 0912.

And the pain may not be over as CEO Alex Rodrigues noted in an email to employees that the remaining 30% of workers will focus on winding down operations. The company said in a regulatory filing that about 230 employees were laid off Friday. A source familiar with the plan said the cuts were announced Friday morning. The layoffs are expected to occur in the first and second quarters. Unfortunately, after thoroughly evaluating all alternatives, we have been unable to identify a path forward for the business in its current form, Rodrigues wrote, later adding Today, having exhausted all alternatives, we are taking the incredibly difficult step of laying off ~70% of the company, and shutting down our SoCal and Houston offices. The layoffs come more than a month after banking advisory firm Evercore met with various AV companies to explore selling Embarks assets, according to one source. A sale of assets appears to be the next order of business, according to a regulatory filing posted Friday and Rodrigues email. Embarks board approved Wednesday a process to explore, review and evaluate a range of potential strategic alternatives available to the company, including alternative uses of its assets to commercialize its technology, additional sources of financing, as well as potential dissolution or liquidation of its assets. The board’s decision comes following an extended evaluation by the company of alternative markets in which to commercialize its technology as well as an exploration, performed with the assistance of a financial advisor, of a potential sale of the company, the filling said. Embark Trucks was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak and quickly got the attention of investors. Rodrigues and Moak met while working on self-driving technology at the University of Waterloo, where both completed Mechatronics engineering degrees. By 2018, the startup had raised about $47 million. But it was the SPAC boom that really delivered the capital — at least for a short time. In 2021, agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II in a deal valued at $5.2 billion. Today, Embark Trucks is running short on capital like other companies trying to develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. The companys market capitalization is about $90 million; at the end of the third quarter, the most recent quarterly report the company has filed, it had about $190 million in cash and cash equivalents.

The software consultancy firm laid off about 4% of its global workforce — approximately 500 employees — a figure that the company did not dispute when reached for comment on Wednesday. TechCrunch learned that the company initially informed its affected employees about the decision on Tuesday, and the layoffs will continue in the coming days. We confirm that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by about four percent globally, Thoughtworks global public relations head Linda Horiuchi said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. We did not make this decision lightly and regret that we had to say goodbye to some talented and passionate Thoughtworkers. These changes were necessary to support the future growth of our business. Thoughtworks has over 12,500 employees across 18 countries on five continents, including the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The company also has a strong presence in India, though the spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the move did not include any layoffs in the country. Earlier this week, Thoughtworks reported an 8.3% year-over-year surge in quarterly revenue compared to the same period last year, totaling more than $310 million. This revenue growth also contributed to the companys net income of $16.1 million in the fourth quarter, an improvement from its loss of almost $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. The Chicago-headquartered company also forecast to generate revenue between $303 million and $305 million in the current quarter and anticipated a year-over-year growth in revenue of between 0.5% and 2.5% for the overall year. On Wednesday, Thoughtworks was trading at $7.34 per share with a market cap of $2.29 billion.

The reduction is coming about two months after South Korean internet firm Naver completed its acquisition of the company earlier this year for $1.2 billion. Naver agrees to acquire fashion marketplace Poshmark for $1.2B Poshmark confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is cutting its workforce due to the economic slowdown but did not disclose the number of people impacted. We made the difficult decision to reduce the size of some of our teams to better align with our priorities for the future, the current economic climate and our return to being a private company, a spokesperson at Poshmark told TechCrunch. We are incredibly grateful for the contributions of the talented people in the roles that were impacted. It also did not disclose the number of total employees at the company, nor whether the layoffs would be in the U.S. only or globally. On its LinkedIn Profile, it describes itself as having over 800 employees. We have asked the questions and will update this post as we learn more. Update, 2/24/23, 9:05 AM ET: The spokesperson told TechCrunch that less than 2% of its workforce was affected, primarily in the U.S. The affected employees were notified this week, the spokesperson said, adding that Poshmark offered each employee financial support, continued full healthcare coverage and outplacement services. Poshmarks job cuts come as a number of tech companies are also downsizing their workforces. As the economy dips, tech companies, in particular, have seen their businesses slow down, and so they are turning to layoffs as part of bigger cost-cutting strategies to focus more on profitability. That is a trend that has not spared fashion e-commerce, with others like Everlane and StitchFix collectively laying off hundreds of employees in recent months. Founded in 2011, Poshmark claims to have more than 80 million registered users across the U.S., Canada, Australia and India. It was delisted from Nasdaq after the Naver acquisition was completed, but according to the last accounts it filed in 2021, it had an annual gross merchandise volume of $1.8 billion and posted net revenues of $44.4 million in Q3 2022, an 11% year-on-year increase, with a gross merchandise value of $475.6 million in the same period. At the time of Navers acquisition, Poshmarks leadership touted the scaling potential and technology investments that would come with the deal. As a part of Naver, well benefit from their financial resources, significant technology capabilities and leading presence across Asia to expand our platform and enhance our user experience for the Poshmark community and create additional value for all our stakeholders, founder and CEO of Poshmark Manish Chandra said in its statement earlier this year. [We] look forward to seeing Poshmark employees benefit from being part of a larger, global organization who shares our values and vision around content, community and empowerment. During its press conference in San Francisco last month, Poshmark unveiled a new shopping feature, Posh Lens, which will enable users to find a list of similar products on the Poshmark platform when they take a picture of a product using Posh Lens. CEO of Naver, Sooyeon Choi, said in its statement in January that Naver technologies like its search engine, AI recommendation and e-commerce tools, would all get incorporated into Poshmark to enhance the user experience on the platform. 3 takeaways from the Poshmark-Naver deal",

        "Extracted Article": "Green Labs, a Seoul-based agritech startup, has secured $38.4 million (50 billion won) in debt financing from existing investors BRV Capital Management and Skylake Incuvest. The new funding comes just a month after the startup laid off around 70% of its workforce, or 350 people, in February as part of a restructuring, Green Labs CEO Sanghoon Shin said in an interview with TechCrunch that it now has a headcount of 150 people, adding that the companys selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) had been reduced by about 80% compared to year-end 2022. The startup has built smart farming software and hardware for farmers to digitize the entire agriculture value chain, from crop to distribution. Shin told me the companys Farm Morning app aggregates farm data, then artificial intelligence gives insights into crop lifecycle and also provides a network through which farmers can connect and share insights. Indeed, 900,000 farmers currently use the app in South Korea, and that figure has tripled in the past 12 months since its launch in 2021, Shin said. It also operates B2B marketplace Sinsun Market, and it has the ambition to be a LinkedIn for farmers, Shin added. Green Labs, which raked in $140 million in a Series C in January 2022, ran out of money as it overstretched its expansion, TechCrunch reported last month. This time, Shin walked me through what happened to the company and how it plans to revive. The major cause was its new service, accounts receivable factoring, also known as invoice discounting. Green Labs purchases agriculture products from farmers and sells them to buyers/B2B partners with outstanding invoices. In other words, the startup pays farmers and buyers early and receives money from them late. It has thousands of B2B partners, according to Shin. The problem arose when South Koreas bond market froze in the second half of last year due to the default of the theme park Legoland. Financial firms began to suspend factoring financing of accounts receivables as market uncertainties grew. Green Labs was borrowing money for cash liquidity with credit sales as collateral, but its lender, Lotte Card, suspended the factoring financing late last year, and the startup had to repay massive loans all at once. Green Labs had to go through with restructuring and layoffs. Shin said the company generated sales of approximately $77 million in 2021 and more than $230 million in 2022. The new money will go toward advancing the farm morning app and expanding its business in South Korea and Japan, Shin said. Green Labs already has 300,000 users in Japan after launching there in the fall of last year. When asked about its invoice discounting service, Shin said Green Labs will continue to act as a middleman for farmers and buyers, but will manage the business in a more conservative manner. Its global peers include Dehaart and Farmers Business Network. After the last funding, the companys two investors, BRV Capital Management and Skylake, became the largest shareholder of Green Labs, while other investors, including SK Square and Shin, own the rest. Farmers Business Network just raked in a whopping $110 million in Series D funding Indian agritech DeHaat tops $700 million valuation in $60 million funding",

This was a difficult yet necessary decision as we pursue our ambitious plans for Evernote, a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. The company has been unprofitable for years and the situation was unsustainable in the long term. The spokesperson wouldnt confirm which specific departments were impacted. But posts on LinkedIn and Blind suggest the layoffs touched a wide range of core Evernote teams, including the product design, engineering, HR, sales, customer service and marketing departments. Evernote has indeed had its ups and downs over the past few decades, with mass layoffs in 2015 and 2018 a year which also saw an exodus of top execs including Evernote’s chief technical officer, chief financial officer, chief product officer and head of HR. But the company appeared to have turned things around more or less, reporting $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within the last five years. Its unlikely Bending Spoons, for its part, was badly hurting for liquidity. The company recently closed a $340 million venture round and eclipsed $100 million in ARR last September. So whats the explanation for the cuts? It could be as simple as Bending Spoons priming Evernote for profitability. No doubt, the corporate parent wants a quick return on its investment, and its perhaps feeling additional pressure from investors. (Bending Spoons was bootstrapped until relatively recently.) But its also true that Evernote wasnt particularly competitive. Despite its reported high ARR, prior to the acquisition, the company largely failed to keep pace with competitors like Notion opting to rely heavily on a consumer-focused freemium model while eschewing the kinds of collaboration features embraced by its rivals. In any case, staffers are an unfortunate casualty of the circumstances.",

The restructuring comes as Convoy transitions to a new customer service model that automates many of the tasks conducted by employees, according to a LinkedIn post published Thursday by CEO and co-founder Dan Lewis. This shift represents a big step forward in how we operate, but it comes at a cost. Increased automation and tighter focus have changed our staffing needs, Lewis wrote. Convoy will shut down its Atlanta office. It will maintain a small team in the city, according to the post. Jobs in other regions will also be cut, including those tied to its changing customer service model and other aspects of the business. A spokesperson confirmed the move and said, We have restructured to further streamline and improve our shipper experience. The company declined to disclose how many workers are losing their jobs. Convoy launched in 2015 to modernize freight brokerage, a fragmented and oftentimes analog business that matches loads from shippers with truckers. The company developed software that helps automate the process of connecting truckers and shippers. It has since added more fintech products to its digital platform, including a fuel card, quick payments and a drop-and-hook service that allows shippers to pre-load Convoy trailers and set them aside so truckers can pick them up during more flexible windows. Convoy cut 7% of its workforce in June just three months after raising $260 million in equity and debt. The Series E equity was led by Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price and the $100 million venture-debt investment came from Hercules Capital. Convoys valuation was $3.8 billion at the time. More layoffs followed in October. &nbsp;",

        "Extracted Article": "Customer experience firm Sprinklr has laid off roughly 4% of its global workforce — or more than 100 employees — as it realigns its headcount amid the ongoing economic slowdown. Sprinklr started the layoff drive last week and is cutting its workforce in India, the U.S. and other regions, TechCrunch learned from people familiar with the matter and confirmed with the company through an email. A Sprinklr spokesperson said that the strategic business decision affected employees across certain targeted regions, segments and support functions. While these decisions are extremely hard to make, it is the right decision for our long-term success as we shift from a capacity-driven to productivity-driven business model, the spokesperson said in a prepared statement. Our first priority is to support our employees with the greatest care and respect, show appreciation for their contributions to Sprinklr, and to assist them in their transition. We then will realign with a focus on making it easier to sell, and to deliver profitable growth to the business. On February 7, the New York-based firm notified the initial batch of its affected employees. It confirmed to TechCrunch that the decision did not impact any C-level executives. Sprinklr did not disclose the exact number of employees being laid off due to the decision. The company had 3,245 employees as of January 31, 2022, according to an SEC filing (PDF). Of the total headcount at the time, 933 were based in the United States and 2,312 were based internationally, including 1,580 in India. In the last few months, Sprinklr has partnered with entities including Samsung, Sitel Group and Europes largest department store, El Corte to enhance shopping experiences for their customers. However, the current economic uncertainty in the market is likely to push companies to cut back on non-essential expenses, including marketing and social media management, which may lead to a decrease in demand for Sprinklrs services. This is not the first time that Sprinklr laid off its employees in the past year. In July, the company reportedly cut at least 50 roles in its global marketing department. In its Q3 earnings, Sprinklr reported a 24% year-on-year increase in its revenue to $157.3 million from $127.1 million a year ago. The companys operating loss in the quarter was $4.6 million, down from $24.8 million a year ago. Sprinklrs shares traded at $11.02 per share on Tuesday, with a market cap of $2.87 billion.",

The layoffs are part of a restructure aimed to put Getaround on the path to sustainable profitability and long-term growth, the company said in a statement. Per LinkedIn, Getaround has 421 employees, so the staff cuts should affect around 42 employees. Getaround would not confirm the exact number, but a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch the layoffs exclusively affect North American teams across all departments. The news comes a day after Getaround received a delisting warning from the New York Stock Exchange because its stock price has been trading too low. Following the companys announcement, shares of Getaround spiked 17% after hours from $0.64 at market close to $0.75, but have since settled to around $0.65, which is still a 2.19% increase today. Getaround, which joined the public markets in December via a merger with InterPrivate II Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), said it would also significantly reduce other operating expenses like the companys contract workforce and outside professional services. Like almost every other executive over the past year who has ordered layoffs, Sam Zaid, Getarounds CEO, said the restructuring plan is a response to an uncertain near-term macroeconomic outlook, which has hit technology companies particularly hard. Getaround expects the restructuring to result in cost savings of between $25 million and $30 million on an annualized run-rate basis. Its not yet clear how the companys decision to go public through a SPAC merger has affected its balance sheets. The deal was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022, and Getaround has yet to set a date for its earnings release. Regulatory filings show Getarounds cash burn in the first nine months of 2022 was $63.2 million. The company reported $45 million in revenue for the same period, which is a decrease from $48 million the year prior. By the end of Q3, Getaround had $27.2 million in cash to play around with. The merger would have brought the company another $228 million of gross proceeds to stay in operation and achieve its next phase of growth. Despite the near-term infusion of cash, Getaround stood by its decision to cut staff, saying it is taking a multi-year view of the responsible fiscal actions required to maximize the use of proceeds in the face of an unclear economic environment.

The company said Monday that Igor Torgov, former executive VP of digital at the company, has been hired as its CEO. Prior to Arrival, Torgov held a number of CEO, COO and other leadership positions at Atol, Bitfury, Yota, Columbus IT and Microsoft. The cuts announced Monday would reduce its workforce by 50%, to about 800 employees globally. Arrival said the layoffs along with other reductions in real estate and third-party spending will help it cut operating costs by $30 million a quarter. This is the third time since July that Arrival has taken drastic measures to stay viable. The company, which went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, announced in July a restructuring plan that included a 30% reduction in spending across the entire business that could “potentially impact up to 30% of employees globally.” Arrival said, at the time, the plan would allow the company to meet its targets through late 2023 using the $500 million of cash it had on hand. As of December 31, 2022, that cash-on-hand number had dropped to $205 million. The company, which has centered its business plan around using microfactories to build its products, was initially focused on its electric bus product, which achieved certification in the European Union in May 2022. The plan was to start producing with customer models by the second half of the year. In October, just a few months from its first restructuring, the company said it was shifting its focus to the United States and away from the U.K. market, where it is headquartered and where the first EV vans were supposed to be delivered. Arrival said it expects to start production of the van in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2024, subject to raising additional capital.",

If you’re reading this as a post on our site, sign up here so you can receive it directly in the future. Every week, I’ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s my job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know. — Mary Ann Greetings from Austin, Texas, where an ice storm hit last week and caused widespread damage across the city. I know, I know — Austin is known for its 100+ degree temperatures in the summertime. Who would have expected this to happen here? And not just once but twice in two years. Surely not I, when my family moved here in 2013. We’re going on Day 5 with no power, heat or internet. That’s why this newsletter is being published a day later than it would have under normal circumstances. Our neighborhood has many beautiful mature trees, including many oaks. It’s one of the things we loved most about it when deciding to live here. It’s also the same reason our neighborhood was hit SO hard by this storm. Branches from one of those trees fell on our power line, making the outage not just inconvenient but also scary. While this has been extremely stressful — my 89-year-old mother lives with us and our biggest priority has been trying to keep her warm and comfortable — there have been bright spots, like the kindness of a neighbor I’d never met before sharing a wheelchair so I could transport my mother somewhere else and a friend who offered a portable generator so that we could at least have some power for a little while. Anyway, hopefully by the time I’m writing this next week, we’ll have our actual power back. Fingers crossed. Image Credits: Amy Tomlinson The layoffs keep coming There appears to be no end in sight for layoffs in the fintech space. PayPal was the latest large company to announce layoffs — with about 2,000 full-time employees, or 7% of its workforce, affected. On January 30, the payments giant publicly shared a letter that president and CEO Dan Schulman had sent to employees in which he noted the cuts would take place over the coming weeks “with some organizations impacted more than others.” Schulman added: “Over the past year, we made significant progress in strengthening and reshaping our company to address the challenging macro-economic environment…While we have made substantial progress in right-sizing our cost structure, and focused our resources on our core strategic priorities, we have more work to do. We must continue to change as our world, our customers, and our competitive landscape evolve.” He did not provide further details, saying only the company would provide the affected “with generous packages, engage in consultation where required, and support them with their transitions.” The company’s stock perked up on the news. After closing at $79.64 on January 30, shares closed up 7.4% at $85.52 on February 3. It’s not the first round of layoffs for PayPal in recent times. Last spring, TechCrunch reported that PayPal had laid off dozens of employees from its San Jose headquarters around a week before the fintech confirmed that it was shuttering its San Francisco office. To better understand why it matters so much to us what publicly traded companies like PayPal do, head here. But PayPal was not the only publicly traded fintech to lay off employees last week. American Banker reported on January 30 that SoFi Technologies had cut some employees in its tech unit. A spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company had let go of less than 5% of its staff in its tech platform business unit. The company has about 1,300 employees. (Note: a previous version of this article stated that the layoffs had impacted its mortgage division). Meanwhile, Silicon Hills News (operated by the very talented Laura Lorek) reported that Austin-based insurtech Decent is “shutting down all of its operations to just a core team,” which was confirmed in a blog post published by Nick Soman, the company’s founder and CEO. The company had raised $43 million in funding from investors such as Foundation Capital, QED Investors and Maverick Ventures, according to Silicon Hills. In his blog post, Soman said the company wound down its health insurance product in anticipation of signing on a partner, who recently backed out in what the founder called “a massive and unexpected setback.” And lastly (that we know of), DriveWealth confirmed that it has reduced its headcount by 20%, the company told TC’s Natasha Mascarenhas. In a statement, DriveWealth told her that the cuts were part of “a number of strategic decisions to evolve as a global brokerage infrastructure company, with a tech-focused and product- and partner-centric organization, and increased organizational agility. In January, DriveWealth CEO Terry Angelos announced on Twitter that he was “leaving the digital custody and clearing firm just eight months after stepping into the role,” according to InvestmentNews. (Note: Angelos told TechCrunch in February that he had actually operationally left the business in December prior to the layoffs, but only announced in January.) The company has raised over $550 million since its 2012 inception, according to Crunchbase. It last raised in August of 2021 — a $450 million Series D funding round at a $2.85 billion valuation. Insight Partners and Accel co-led that round. Other backers include Greyhound Capital, SoftBank Vision Fund and Point72 Ventures. According to PitchBook, DriveWealth has 300 employees, although it is not clear if that was before or after the recent layoffs. It’s apparent that even well-funded companies are not immune to the challenging macroenvironment. In fact, is it just me or does it seem like it’s the most well-funded companies that are doing the layoffs? Maybe since they had more resources and the ability to hire to begin with? Or maybe because they are more high-profile, news of their layoffs makes a bigger splash? I’m not sure, but sadly I don’t think the fintech job cuts are slowing down anytime soon. Stay tuned for a new section in upcoming newsletters that focuses on companies that are hiring, rather than laying off. Other weekly news Marqeta shared with me exclusively that it has agreed to acquire two-year-old fintech infrastructure startup Power Finance for $223 million in cash, marking the first acquisition in the publicly traded company’s 13-year history. I had the opportunity to interview new CEO Simon Khalaf, who shared with me the reasoning behind the purchase. Power’s first product is a credit card issuance program, which is designed for companies, brands and banks to offer fintech experiences, such as customized credit card programs, targeted promotions and personalized rewards, embedded into existing mobile and web applications. Marqeta’s main goal with the purchase is to expand and “significantly accelerate the capabilities” offered in its credit product. More details here. As reported by Reuters, which cited The Financial Times: “Twitter Inc is working to introduce payments on the social media platform and has begun applying for regulatory licenses. New boss Elon Musk is pushing Twitter to create new streams of revenue as it faces a drop in advertising income, following his $44-billion takeover of the company in October.” Meanwhile, MacRumors reported that “the Apple Pay Later service that Apple has in the works is set to launch ‘soon.’ TechCrunch first reported about the initiative last June. Reports TechCrunch’s Carly Page: Ion Group, a Dublin-based software company that helps financial institutions automate their critical business processes, has been hit by a ransomware attack that forced several European and U.S. banks to revert to manual processes. More here. Multiple news outlets reported that Thrive Capital is said to be leading a $2.5 billion to $3 billion investment in Stripe, at a $55 billion to $60 billion valuation. The New York–based firm, started by Joshua Kushner, also led the company’s $70 million Series C in 2014 when it was valued at $3.5 billion. All parties are staying quiet. Meanwhile, Stripe competitor Checkout.com announced last week that Céline Dufétel was appointed president and COO of Checkout.com — she was formerly CFO and COO — and will remain based in New York. In her expanded role, she will oversee all operational and go-to-market teams, including finance and marketing. Nirupam Sinha will take on an expanded role as CFO. The company told me via email that with Dufétel’s new appointment, Checkout.com “is staking its claim in the U.S.” This New York Times article does a great job of examining how buy now, pay later may be a “victim of its own success.” Writes James Ledbetter: “The industry is now facing an existential crisis, as profits remain elusive, valuations plummet, competition increases and regulators ask tough questions about the lending practices behind B.N.P.L.” Embedded fintech remains hot. Fintech infrastructure startup Unit last week launched white-label UIs. Via email, the company told TechCrunch that it believes the UIs represent “the fastest and easiest way for companies to build an embedded banking experience, get to market, and realize new revenue streams.” One more player giving Stripe a run for its money. More here. American Express is doubling down on SMEs. The credit card giant, as reported by Finovate, launched American Express Business Blueprint — a set of digital cash flow management tools for small businesses. According to Finovate: “The new offering evolved out of Kabbage, an alternative lending startup that the company acquired in 2020. With the launch of Business Blueprint, the Kabbage brand is now retired.” Amex isn’t the only one focusing on SMBs. Tillful, a free business credit app built by VC-backed startup Flowcast, CEO and founder Ken So reiterated the company’s commitment to SMBs in this blog post. Last year, Brex made headlines for cutting off its SMB customers, and according to So, Divvy recently ended its credit-builder program. (Note: This has not been independently verified by TC.)

Why this caught my attention: A $45 million Series B in this environment is a big deal. Plus, I covered this company in December 2020 when it raised $27 million in an “oversubscribed” Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). This time around, Commerce Ventures led the financing, which also included participation from repeat backers a16z and Bain Capital Ventures, as well as Visa and Sorenson Ventures. It’s always interesting when previous backers double down on their investments, and in this case, several existing backers put money in this round. What does it do? Moov was born when CEO and founder Wade Arnold and Bob Smith started an open source movement in 2017 to help developers learn how to build and integrate payments into their products. Arnold had founded Banno, a white label digital banking platform, which was acquired by Jack Henry in 2014 (Smith was an employee). Their goal at the time of inception, Arnold said in 2020, was “to lend a trusted hand to developers building or integrating financial products.” It has since worked to build what Arnold describes as its “full-stack approach to powering payments.” In the past, the company has been public about “taking business from Stripe.” Still, at the time of Moov’s last raise, Arnold told me: “Stripe simplified e-commerce checkout for all by putting developers first. Moov echoes the ethos in putting developers first but we’re focused on the underpinning infrastructure of payments and banking. We would like to think that Stripe could have leveraged Moov if we existed when they started.” Fun fact: In 2021, the startup created fintech_devcon, a flagship event for fintech developers. The third one will be held in August in my home base of Austin, Texas.

It’s been an incredible experience putting this together every week, and I am honored you all still rely on me for the latest fintech news. Until next week — when I hope to have power back!! — take good care. And thanks for hanging in there with me. Xoxo, Mary Ann",

        "Extracted Article": "Around a year ago, Tier Mobility was winning the shared micromobility game. Fueled by its $200 million Series D fundraise in October 2021, the company went on to acquire three other micromobility operators and a computer vision startup, giving it access to e-bikes — a reach that extended beyond Europe and into the U.S. — and the tech needed to assuage politicians fears over safety. Today, Tier is in the midst of another round of layoffs. As a result of previous restructurings, Tier is laying off around 80 workers, some of whom are under the Nextbike umbrella, to make up for redundancies. Tier had purchased the German bike-share startup in November 2021 to expand its vehicle offerings beyond e-scooters. Tier said the layoffs announced Wednesday will affect 7% of its overall staff headcount. While some teams will be more affected than others, the restructuring affects employees across the organization. The most recent staff cuts follow Tiers decision to let 180 employees go back in August, blaming a poor funding environment and uncertain economic conditions. The micromobility operator is also reducing the size of its Spin workforce by about 20 employees. Tier originally bought Spin from Ford in March 2022, a move that gave the company widespread access to the U.S. Seven months later, Tier then laid off almost 80 Spin workers and exited Seattle and Canada. The company went on to let go of an additional 30 Spin employees in December when it decided to leave another 10 U.S. cities. A Tier spokesperson told TechCrunch the company tried to rematch workers from redundant roles with any open roles at Tier and Nextbike to retain as many people as possible. All-out growth mode to profitability first How did Tier go from being the largest micromobility player in the world to now announcing layoffs every few months? Sure, the macroeconomic climate has affected most tech companies, and Tier is hardly the only micromobility operator to announce staff cuts (lookin at you, Bird.) It seems that Tier, like most other tech companies facing hard decisions, was expanding for a pace of economic growth thats simply not being realized in pre-recession 2023. Tier CEO and co-founder Lawrence Leuschner said todays round of layoffs is part of a pivot in the companys overall strategy, from all-out growth mode to a profitability first mindset. The restructuring will include the closure of a small number of cities where we do not see a path to profitability due to factors like unfavorable regulatory approaches, said the company. Tier did not say which cities it would exit, but the operators future in Paris currently hangs in the balance as the city votes whether or not to renew the permits of Tier, Lime and Dott. However, the citys strict regulations might just make it unprofitable for Tier to be in Paris at this point. Tier is also shutting down a number of side projects, like its own vehicle design program and the Tier Energy Network, the companys plan to place charging stations in retail stores to incentivize riders to swap scooter batteries for rewards. On the other hand, the company will be winding up its monthly scooter subscription service, MyTier. Downsizing is challenging for any business and particularly difficult for a company like Spin, which has already made fundamental changes to the business to ensure its long-term future, said Philip Reinckens, CEO at Spin.

        "Extracted Article": "Sophos is laying off about 10% of its global workforce, TechCrunch has learned. Sophos confirmed the layoffs in an email to TechCrunch. Sophos today announced an internal restructuring which has resulted in job losses and the start of consultation periods that potentially will affect 10% of our global employee base, said Jitendra Bulani, a spokesperson for Sophos. The company said the layoffs were to ensure the company achieves the optimal balance of growth and profitability, amid the ongoing and deepening economic global slowdown. TechCrunch learned that about 450 people were let go during this round of layoffs, though Sophos would not confirm the exact number of affected employees. TechCrunch first learned of the layoffs after hearing of several employees in India who were let go. Some affected employees in the country were informed on Tuesday and asked to submit their resignations. Sophos is taking these steps for two main reasons: first, to ensure that we achieve the optimal balance of growth and profitability to support Sophos long-term success, which is particularly important in the midst of a challenging and uncertain macro environment; and second, to allocate our investments across the company to support our strategic imperative to be a market leader in delivering cybersecurity as a service. Sophos told TechCrunch that the layoffs may affect all job roles, but declined to provide further details. Sophos said the plan to cut jobs was to focus more on cybersecurity services, specifically on managed detection and response. This is to achieve its goal of becoming a top player in the global cybersecurity market, the spokesperson said. More than half a million organizations worldwide use Sophos technologies, including endpoint detection and network, email and cloud security, which generate more than $1 billion in revenue, the firm said. Sophos said its managed services business generates over $175 million annually and is growing at over 50% per year. In March 2020, private equity firm Thoma Bravo acquired Sophos in a $3.9 billion deal. We are grateful for the contributions of all our team members, past and present, in building Sophos into a cybersecurity leader, and in helping to keep the world safe from the evils of cybercrime, the spokesperson said. Sophos is joining a growing list of technology companies that have had to lay off their workforce due to financial difficulties. Tech giants including Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have also had to let go of thousands of employees in recent months. Thoma Bravo makes $3.9 billion offer to acquire security firm Sophos",

        "Extracted Article": "SmartNews, a Tokyo-headquartered news aggregation website and app valued at $2 billion as of 2021, today announced a 40% reduction of its U.S. and China workforce, or around 120 people, according to sources familiar with the companys plans. The news was announced on Thursday in an all-hands meeting attended this evening by SmartNews staff. The company confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, saying the current economic conditions were to blame. Impacted roles in the U.S. and China include those in engineering, product and data science, we understand. SmartNews employees in Japan, meanwhile, will soon undergo a voluntary departure program, but they werent yet offered specifics about what that will entail. Laid-off employees will be offered standard severance packages and benefits. In the meeting, staff were told theyd get an email within 15 minutes if they were among those being let go. In total, SmartNews employs nearly 900 people, including its contract workforce, one-third of which work outside Japan. [Update: see more details below above deeper cuts being reported in the U.S.] Sources also told TechCrunch that the company had opted to close its U.S. offices for two days, Thursday and Friday, without giving a reason, which worried employees ahead of the remotely streamed all-hands meeting. This isnt your fault and I am sorry to see you leave, remarked SmartNews CEO Ken Suzuki, when making the announcement. After the announcement was made, the meeting quickly ended, leaving no time for Q&amp;A, frustrating some staff. Founded in 2012 in Japan, the company arrived in the U.S. in 2014 and expanded its local news footprint in early 2020 to cover thousands of U.S. cities. It has relationships with more than 3,000 global publishing partners whose content is available through its service on the web and mobile devices. In its markets, the app grew to become a top news aggregator due to how it personalizes the readers experience using machine learning technology to pick which articles are displayed. In the U.S., it also differentiated itself from others with a News From All Sides feature, which allows users to access news from across a range of political perspectives. In addition, during high-profile events like the COVID-19 pandemic or U.S. elections, SmartNews would offer in-app dashboards that offered critical information at a glance. Image Credits: Sensor Tower The company managed to attract investors, raising more than $400 million since its founding in 2012, despite hefty competition from built-in aggregators like Apple News and Google News, on iOS and Android. In its most recent funding round, a Series F, investors poured in $230 million into the business, valuing it as a double unicorn ($2 billion), the companys press release stated. New investors included U.S.-based Princeville Capital and Woodline Partners, as well as JIC Venture Growth Investments, Green Co-Invest Investment and Yamauchi-No.10 Family Office in Japan. Existing backers ACA Investments and SMBC Venture Capital also participated. The SmartNews app globally reached 30 million monthly active users, with 20 million in Japan and 10 million in the United States, we understand. However, those numbers have been trending down in both markets by around 10-20%, a source said. Since January 2014, SmartNews reached nearly 81 million worldwide installs from across the App Store and Google Play, according to estimates from Sensor Tower. As of 2022, its biggest markets by downloads were Japan (58%) and the U.S. (38%), Sensor Tower said. SmartNews, unfortunately, was impacted by the same macroeconomic factors that have led to a number of tech industry layoffs in recent months, in addition to complications that arose from Apples implementation of App Tracking Transparency, or ATT. The iOS new privacy measure introduced in 2021 hurt companies whose business models relied on advertising, including Meta and Snap, while boosting Apples own ads business. The company could have gone public back in 2019, but leadership pressed for additional funding and a higher valuation. Now that opportunity could be slipping. Reached for comment, SmartNews confirmed the layoffs and offered the following statement: Unfortunately, we are not immune to the current economic conditions that have negatively affected so many businesses. In order to maintain the health of our company and to ensure future growth, we decided to conduct a reorganization that has impacted many of our incredible employees. This was a last resort decision for us, and we hope the severance packages and career transition management services offered to impacted employees will help in their search for a new role. Update, 2/8/23, 4:30 PM ET: SmartNews Layoffs Broaden Although our earlier report had cited staff reductions of around 40%, were now hearing the layoffs have since gone much deeper. Sources at the company, including current and former employees, tell us that SmartNews had somewhere north of 145 employees in the U.S., and now it has only around 60 which means around 85 U.S. employees were laid off. Another source had a slightly different figure of 74 U.S. employees laid off. One source alleged SmartNews has been trying to keep these further cuts quiet, but the impacted staff has included full teams across media and engineering even managers, in some cases. Employees were offered 3 months severance and the package included healthcare. We understand the layoffs in Japan are ongoing, as the company is trying to force voluntary layoffs there. SmartNews declined to comment on these claims saying it had nothing more to share than its original statement (above).",

        "Extracted Article": "Greenlight, a fintech startup offering debit cards to kids, has laid off 104 employees — or over 21% of its total headcount of 485 employees — to better align with ongoing operating expenses amid the economic slowdown. TechCrunch learned about the layoff that was announced to its employees earlier this week. The startup later confirmed the development over an email. The macroeconomic environment has impacted virtually all businesses, including Greenlight. We recently made the difficult decision to better align our ongoing operating expenses with the current environment, a Greenlight spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The spokesperson said the impacted employees would receive severance, extended medical coverage, and career transition support. The startup announced the decision on Tuesday and now has a workforce of 381 employees. The company remains committed to its mission to help parents raise financially smart kids. Moving into 2023, Greenlight will be focused on continuing to serve its growing customer base and finding new, impactful ways to improve financial literacy for families, the spokesperson said. Greenlight offers kids a debit card, banking app and financial education to make them financially smart and independent. Community Federal Savings Bank issues the Greenlight debit card. In December, the Atlanta-headquartered startup introduced a web-based financial literacy library aligned with the K-12 national standards that will be free to schools, teachers and students. In October, it also added family safety features to its subscription plan called Greenlight Infinity, which is priced at $14.98 per month for the whole family. According to the data available on Crunchbase, Greenlight has raised about $556.5 million in total since its inception in 2014. The funding included the $260 million Series D round that was announced in 2021 at a valuation of $2.3 billion. Greenlight is one of the latest startups to lay off its staff during this challenging time. In the last few days, startups such as Career Karma, Carta and Coinbase let many of their employees go to reduce expenses. Big tech companies, including Amazon and Salesforce, have also laid off thousands of workers this month as the economy continues to struggle. Additionally, the growing economic slowdown has impacted prominent fintech startups, including Stripe, which laid off 14% of its workforce in November. The startup also cut its internal valuation yet again to $63 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier on Thursday.",

        "Extracted Article": "Learning navigation platform Career Karma has laid off another 22 people across its global and domestic workforce, less than five months after it cut 60 staff members, according to sources. CEO and co-founder Ruben Harris confirmed the workforce reduction to TechCrunch. The cut shows that even as many edtech companies attempt to right-size their staff, there’s more work to do. Harris’ e-mail to remaining staff underscores the tension of today: Once eager enterprise customers are still making up their minds on whether or not to sign up for new tools, leading to extended sales cycles and uncertainty. “Last year, we made the decision to right-size the company so that we can orient Career Karma toward working with employers and now that we have started to sign customers its clear that we made the right decision,” Harris wrote in the email. “What’s unclear is how Fortune 1000 companies will be responding to the macroeconomic environment and its important for us to give ourselves time to work with them to figure that out.” As the market evolves, Career Karmas service of matching employees or professionals to tech bootcamps is being put in a difficult place. Just last month, BloomTech, a coding bootcamp previously known as Lambda School, cut half of staff in pursuit of profitability. During Career Karmas last cut, Harris emphasized that the layoff and its previously-closed $40 million Series B would extend the startups runway to three years. After laying off staff this week, Career Karma now has five years of runway. As TechCrunch has discussed in the past, the strategy of “extending your runway” always comes into vogue whenever investors slow down investing. Career Karma’s shift from the basic three-year rule of thumb to five years shows how that rule may become even more conservative as the downturn continues. Over email, Harris tells TechCrunch that he “always [wants] to have the option to raise … I just dont want to be forced to raise.” The ‘ideal runway’ is a myth, isn’t it? With 80 staff now remaining at Career Karma, Harris confirmed that no C-suite executives were impacted by the layoff. Those impacted were offered two months of severance as well as extended benefits. The career navigation platform also, fittingly, offered career navigation support to its new alumni.

        "Extracted Article": "Citizen laid off 33 staff members on Wednesday, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. “We are grateful to all of our departing team members for their contributions to Citizen and are committed to supporting them through this transition with a generous severance package that includes accelerated option vesting and extended exercise window, six months of COBRA payments, career services support and other benefits, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. Citizen did not share what departments at the company were impacted; one laid off employee told TechCrunch that at least 10 engineers were let go. Launched in 2016, the app was initially banned from the App Store over concerns about vigilantism it was called Vigilante at the time. Now, Citizen uses public police blotters to notify users about verified incidents in their area, but users can upload their own reports of suspicious activity and livestream from crime scenes as well. According to data from SensorTower, an app analytics firm, Citizen has seen about $30.3 million in consumer spending and over 14 million downloads since its launch. The private company most recently raised a $73 million Series C funding round in early 2021, which included a $23 million convertible note. Citizen has been criticized for encouraging a culture of surveillance that lends itself to racial profiling and harassment; another neighborhood social app Nextdoor has exhibited similar issues. But the most egregious example of these dangers came from the companys CEO himself. In 2021, Andrew Frame offered Citizen users $30,000 to track down a suspected arsonist while livestreaming on the Citizen app. He shared a photo of the suspect on a live feed which racked up 800,000 views, but it turned out he had the wrong guy. According to a report on the incident from Motherboard, Frame saw this as an elaborate marketing opportunity for the apps livestream feature. “We deeply regret our mistake and are working to improve our internal processes to prevent this from happening again,” the company wrote in a statement at the time. Later that year, Citizen launched a service called Protect. For $20 per month, users get 24/7 access to a protect agent who can connect them with first responders or police. But critics have questioned whether Citizens alerts stoke panic and fear more than they keep people safe and that fear can encourage people to purchase access to their own personal security agent. According to SensorTower data, in-app purchases on Citizen increased 17% year over year after the introduction of Protect. But Citizen saw an average of $1.4 million in monthly spending on its app in 2022, which likely isnt enough to make the company profitable. Citizen did not share a reason for conducting layoffs, but letting go of 33 employees could afford the company a bit more runway. According to its website, Citizen is currently hiring for five roles.

        "Extracted Article": "Carta, an equity management platform that was last privately valued at $7.4 billion, has cut 10% of its staff, confirming earlier rumors that a workforce reduction was going to happen. Judging by LinkedIn data, the layoff could have impacted around 200 employees. Todays layoff is around the same size as its 2020 workforce reduction, an event that CEO Henry Ward then partially attributed to a decline in new customers given the coronaviruss impact on business. Years later, Ward is striking the same tone. In an email sent to staff today, obtained by TechCrunch, the CEO said that if our customers suffer, so do we. And right now the entire tech and venture ecosystem is suffering. The company claims that it cut costs in travel, vendor spend, marketing spend and investments in new bets, but that it ultimately had to reduce headcount. Severance packages include 2.5 months of severance with one additional week of severance per completed year of service, and extended mental healthcare services. Those who rely on Carta for a visa will get a 30-minute consultation with immigration counsel. Those who were not impacted by the layoff have the option to voluntarily resign, with the option of a severance package. The well-funded company is dealing with more than the macroeconomic conditions that have caused thousands of tech companies to lay off employees. As TechCrunch reported earlier today, Carta is suing its former CTO, Jerry Talton, who was fired “for cause” almost three weeks ago, on December 23, according to the company. In Carta’s lawsuit, the company references Talton’s “wrongful and illegal acts as an executive of Carta,” including discrimination and the sexual harassment of at least nine women, according to a Carta spokesperson. It doesn’t help that several users of Carta’s services, which range from cap table management to fund administration, have been less than impressed by the platform in the recent months. TechCrunch spoke to a fund manager who was transitioning away from the platform and who claims that his team had four different account managers in a less-than-two-year contract, which “certainly didn’t help with continuity and understanding of our fund and needs.” According to Crunchbase data, Carta has raised $1.1 billion from venture capital investors, including most recently a $500 million Series G by Silver Lake. Other investors in Carta include Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners. So far, the company says it is used by more than 30,000 companies, over 5,000 investment funds, and half a million employees of its customers. Significant venture backing, as this down market reminds us time and time again, isnt necessarily a competitive advantage. Carta, embroiled in former lawsuits and now taking on a current challenge, has thus perhaps unsurprisingly attracted a wide swath of competition in recent years. Its closest competitor, AngelList Venture, has raised dramatically less capital, around $200 million. When TechCrunch asked AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli about recent product changes that put it square in competition with Carta, he shrugged — adding that he has nothing new to add. “Ultimately, there’s going to be a small number of folks who actually have the ability to build a calculated product,” Kohli said in a previous interview. “When I say ability, I don’t mean technical abilities, but the institutional knowledge to build something.” The difficulty of building a company in the venture services landscape was only further proved by the recent shutdown of Assure, a fintech company that helped investors issue special-purpose vehicles. According to Axios, Assure didn’t give investors any reasoning behind its shutdown beyond the following statement: The industry has evolved considerably over the decade since we founded our company. Current market conditions have resulted in Assure evaluating its business model. Let’s see if the industry’s evolution, both with more competition and graveyard companies, is a dynamic that Carta can keep up with.

        "Extracted Article": "The continuing onslaught of tech layoffs has not let up in the new year. Last week, we saw big layoff announcements from Amazon and Salesforce with thousands of employees being let go. Yesterday CRN reported that Cloud Software Group was undertaking massive layoffs. Today the company confirmed it was laying off 15% of the workforce. Although the company would not share just how many people were involved, it appears to be in the thousands. Cloud Software Group was formed last year after PE firms Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital (an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management) took Citrix private in a $16.5 billion deal, the third biggest enterprise M&amp;A deal of last year. At the time, the firms indicated they would be combining Citrix with Tibco, another enterprise firm that Vista had purchased previously. In a post published today from CEO Tom Krause, who was put in charge when the combined company was formed, he confirmed that layoffs had indeed happened. “Yesterday, we notified roughly 15% of the total Cloud Software Group workforce that their roles have been eliminated or made redundant as part of our planning process for the new company,” he said, not pulling any punches. Krause wrote that layoffs are among the toughest decisions any executive has to make, and he acknowledged the pain that comes with these moves. “Please know that these decisions were not taken lightly. Rather, they were practical business decisions designed to strengthen the combined companies,” he wrote. When Vista and Elliott announced that they were acquiring Citrix for such a hefty amount, and combining the two companies, it seemed likely that cost-cutting would follow. At the time, Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller expected as much when he told TechCrunch: “The combo has a lot of assets to play with on the tech side, especially with Citrix’s virtualization and the future of work. But it will be all about execution, and we will see in a few months if Vista and Elliott are undertaking a go-forward and growth strategy, or if they will save costs and ‘milk’ the install base. The high price tag will make the latter strategy hard to lay off, but perhaps with some asset sales, it could work well,” Mueller said. It’s worth noting that Krause said that in addition to eliminating duplicate positions across the two companies, it would be looking at top customers and aligning the product roadmap to meet those customers, so it seems its looking at the installed base that Mueller alluded to. But each of those jobs, redundant or not from a business perspective, was held by an individual who is out of work today, and they join the thousands of other tech workers who have been laid off in recent months. If there is any silver lining to be found here, multiple reports have stated over the last several months that laid off tech workers are quickly finding work.",

        "Extracted Article": "We’ve met with Mojo Vision for several CESes, watching the startup’s AR contact lenses develop, year by year. These sorts of things take a lot of time and money, of course — and these days it seems increasingly difficult to find either. Today, the California-based firm announced that it is “decelerating” work on the Mojo Lens, citing, “significant challenges in raising capital.” In an announcement posted to it site, CEO Drew Perkins blames insurmountable headwinds, including the bad economy and the yet-to-be proven market potential for advanced AR products in its ability to raise the necessary funding required to keep the project afloat. “Although we haven’t had the chance yet to see it ship and to reach its full potential in the marketplace, we have proven that what was once considered science fiction can be developed into a technical reality,” Perkins writes. “Even though the pursuit of our vision for Invisible Computing is on hold for now, we strongly believe that there will be a future market for Mojo Lens and expect to accelerate it when the time is right.” Instead of focusing on Lens, Mojo is focusing its resources on the micro-LED technology that powers it. The company had developed a 14,000 ppi micro-LED display as the product’s foundation. “We believe micro-LED will disrupt the entire $160 billion display industry and our unique technology puts us at the forefront of this disruption,” Perkins adds. Along with the pivot, the company has also made a dramatic cut to head count, reducing its staff by 75%. The lays will impact roles and divisions across the startup. The companys most recent funding round was a $45 million Series B-1 announced a year ago tomorrow. The company declined further comment.",

In recent months, it’s become clear that this aggressive growth was unsustainable,” Crain wrote. “We over-hired, and I take full ownership of this mistake.” TechCrunch reached out to Crain for comment. SuperRare raised a $9 million Series A in March 2021, led by Velvet Sea Ventures and 1confirmation. The round also included celebrity investors like Mark Cuban, Marc Benioff and Ashton Kutcher. SuperRare differentiates itself from competitors by focusing more closely on working with artists, but broader platforms like OpenSea were more successfully able to take advantage of the bull market. Yet even though OpenSea has managed to raise at a possibly inflated valuation of over $13 billion, it has not been immune to the downmarket. The company laid off 20% of its staff, leaving it with 230 employees, in July. “We know that there is still much innovation and transformation yet to come for Web3, NFTs, cryptoart, decentralized finance and governance,” Crain wrote. “We are facing headwinds, yes — but there remains an incredible uncaptured opportunity as we continue building something totally new.” NFT marketplace OpenSea lays off 20% of its staff: We have entered … crypto winter",

        "Extracted Article": "Update: CEO Cheng Lu said laid off workers will remain on the payroll for two months and will receive severance. Well, we knew it was coming. Self-driving trucking technology company TuSimple confirmed Wednesday it plans to lay off 25% of its total workforce as part of a broader restructuring plan designed to keep the company running. The layoffs come a couple of weeks after TuSimple and Navistar ended their deal to co-develop purpose-built autonomous semi trucks. The staff reductions, which we estimate to affect around 350 workers, also follow a rough year for the company, including a series of executive shakeups, multiple federal investigations, a truck crash and a plummeting stock price. Like many other companies exploring pioneer technology, TuSimple has struggled to make up enough revenue to cover its cash burn. Its no secret that the current economic environment is difficult. We must be prudent with our capital and operate as efficiently as possible, said Cheng Lu, TuSimples president and CEO, in a statement. Lu recently re-joined the company as CEO after he was ousted earlier this year. His predecessor and TuSimple’s founder Xiaodi Hou was fired following an internal probe that showed certain employees having ties and sharing confidential information with Hydron, a China-backed hydrogen-powered trucking company. While I deeply regret the impact this has on those affected, I believe it is a necessary step as TuSimple continues down our path to commercialization. This is part of our overall strategy to prioritize investments that bring the most value to shareholders, and position TuSimple as a customer-focused, product-driven organization. TuSimple is in the process of selling off its Asia-focused business, so the layoffs are only affecting staff in the U.S. TuSimple has workers in San Diego, Arizona and Texas. Its not yet clear which teams were affected or if the layoffs will hit a specific region, although one deep perception engineer in Los Angeles has already posted on LinkedIn about being cut. About 80% of the remaining staff are in research and development and are responsible for working in hardware and software resilience, reliability, safety and information security, TuSimple said in a statement. The company is scaling back freight expansion, including unprofitable freight lanes and respective trucking operations that still rely on previous generations of autonomous software, which TuSimple says provides limited value to its ongoing technology development. The focus now is on validating and commercializing its autonomous trucking technology by working with shipping partners, the company said. TuSimple had previously received around 7,000 reservations for its Navistar trucks with customers like DHL Supply Chain, Schneider and U.S. Xpress. Its not clear if any of those partnerships remain, or if TuSimple will have to shop around again. A source familiar with the matter recently told TechCrunch TuSimple would find another truck-maker to work with in the future. The restructure will cost TuSimple about $10 million to $11 million, a line item thatll show up on Q4s balance sheet and be paid in the first quarter of 2023. TuSimple estimates itll save $55 million to $65 million on an annual basis as a result of the layoffs and restructuring. At the time of publishing, TuSimple is trading at $1.42, which is down nearly 6% today and 96% year-to-date. Employees will remain on the payroll for two months, as required under the WARN Act, and TuSimple plans to offer severance on top of that, Lu told TechCrunch.",

The personnel change comes about a month after the company internally announced that its CFO would be leaving at the end of the year for personal reasons, and just months after the Tiger Global–backed company was rumored to be going public. But, as IPO season continues to be frigid, the not-yet-profitable business has clearly opted to make cuts ahead of any 2023 movement. Sources say the restructuring could be the companys attempt to look more profitable ahead of an anticipated public market debut. TechCrunch reached out to Komodo Health for comment but did not yet hear back at time of publication. The company did, however, confirm the layoffs in a LinkedIn post. Co-founders Arif Nathoo and Web Sun wrote a memo to staff, obtained by TechCrunch, which describes the layoffs as part of a broader restructuring as the world changes “again.” “We believe that this is the beginning of a change that may last for many more months, if not years,” the co-founders wrote in the email, sent to all full-time employees. “We have always prided ourselves on running a capital efficient business, and today we’re taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned for the current world around us.” Axios last reported that Komodo’s ARR, as of March, was around $150 million; investors, meanwhile, valued the company at $3.3 billion during its last funding round, a $220 million Series E announced in March 2021. After the email was sent, Komodo Health’s co-founders also held a meeting with remaining employees, adding that the company has closed a structured equity infusion from Dragoneer and Coatue for around $200 million, sources said. The co-founders also stressed that the layoff was meant be one and done. It is unclear whether this round was raised at the same valuation of its March 2021 round. Komodo Health is joining a number of late-stage companies that have announced workforce reductions in the final innings of the year, including Stripe, Plaid and Airtable. It conducted a previous round of layoffs in April 2020, just months after raising a $50 million round from Andreessen Horowitz.

        "Extracted Article": "Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week’s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host Natasha Mascarenhas. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. Outschool laid off a quarter of staff, or 43 people, earlier this week, according to an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch. The edtech company, last valued at $3 billion, confirmed the layoffs over email, citing a focus on core capabilities as “growth has come back down to earth.” The e-mail sent to staff was even more direct. “The truth is the layoffs in our sector are widespread for a reason,” Amir Nathoo, the co-founder of edtech unicorn Outschool, wrote in an email sent to staff. “The funding atmosphere has been dramatically impacted by the anticipation of a recession, higher interest rates and an increased need to show [return on investment] to investors.” To employees, Nathoo’s tone is reminiscent of a conversation he had just months earlier, in July, when the entrepreneur had to run Outschool through its first round of layoffs, which impacted 18% of staff. The entrepreneur’s comments underscore how some of edtech’s boldest and well capitalized companies are struggling. For example, Outschool’s double round of layoffs comes after it raised a Series B, C and D in 12 months and grew its valuation from $1 billion to $3 billion in an even shorter period. As part of this week’s layoff, Outschool co-founder and head of product Nick Grandy is also leaving the company. “I understood that our growth would slow down once learners were able to be back in school full time; however I didn’t anticipate that our growth would slow as dramatically as it has,” Nathoo wrote in the e-mail. “This is on me and I want to sincerely apologize.” In the last quarter of 2022, edtech layoffs have hit venture-backed businesses including but not limited to BloomTech, Vedantu, Teachmint, Reforge, Coursera, Unacademy, Byju’s, Udacity and Brainly. Executive shifts include Quizlet CEO stepping down, Degreed’s CEO stepping aside for the founder’s return, and Invact Metaversity’s co-founder leaving after irreconcilable differences with his co-founder. Class, an edtech company that neared unicorn status only 10 months after launching its Zoom School alternative, also conducted layoffs this year. The company raised a total of $146 million in known venture funding to date, including a SoftBank Vision Fund II check. CEO and founder Michael Chasen did not respond to a request for comment Coding bootcamp BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School, cut half of staff last week, in its third known round of layoffs since the pandemic began. Unlike Outschool and Class, BloomTech wasn’t on a rapid fundraising spree throughout the pandemic. Instead, the reasoning for layoffs seems to be a bit more ambiguous — with CEO Austen Allred only explaining the decision by saying that “we had to cut costs to become profitable.” We now know that the startups that most enjoyed a pandemic-era boom are now the same startups facing difficult questions about how to navigate a not-so-looming downturn. But edtech is a sector that rose to an entirely different stratosphere in 2020 and 2021, as the demand for remote learning skyrocketed. As demand grew, so did investor appetite. The same venture capital rounds that allowed companies to expand their idea of what a total addressable market could look like, are the same tranches that may have forced an overspending and overhiring spree that now requires a correction. Unlike a sector like crypto, which experienced a similar bull run and is now handling a winter of its own, edtech’s explosion touched on uniquely human and non-techie needs. In Outschool’s case, it’s now pivoting to focus more on the tutoring end of its platform to combat the learning loss coming out of COVID-19. It’s safe to say that the sector is shifting from a disruptive mood to maintenance mode. But let’s pause our edtech digging and move on to other happenings from this week in tech. You can find me on Twitter, Substack and Instagram, where I publish more of my words and work. In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about Airtable, Plaid and all your darn AI avatars. Airtable and Plaid We’ll stop talking about layoffs after this section, but there were two cuts this week that truly surprised me: Plaid laid off 20% of staff and, well, so did Airtable. This comes after a long string of layoffs in the fintech space, not limited to but including Chime, Stripe and Opendoor. Here’s why this is important: Both of these startups were hiring and touted as a place for laid-off talent to apply as recently as two weeks ago. All to say, there is so much whiplash out there for job seekers, especially those laid off, around where they can trust for their next gig. I do wonder why these late-stage companies waited so long to conduct layoffs, or if they truly thought they’d be able to ride through this downturn with high expenses. What changed to make them finally pull the plug? Note that Airtable’s layoff seems to be especially sweeping — seeing that its chief product officer, chief people officer and chief revenue officer are also parting ways with the company as it pivots to focus more on the enterprise side of its business.

Jokes aside, if you have been on tech Twitter at all during the last few weeks, you’ve probably seen some pretty sleek, imaginative algorithmically generated portraits of your friends (and nemeses). The company behind these magic avatars is Lensa AI, which has unsurprisingly been climbing up the app store. It’s damn cool. Yes, I’m tempted. But, not to rain all over your new Twitter pictures, there are already questions about how it’s being used and its impact on artists. Here’s why this is important via my colleague, Taylor Hatmaker: While the tech world has celebrated the advancements of AI image and text generators this year — and artists have watched the proceedings warily — your average Instagram user probably hasn’t struck up a philosophical conversation with ChatGPT or fed DALL-E absurdist prompts. That also means that most people haven’t grappled with the ethical implications of free, readily available AI tools like Stable Diffusion and how they’re poised to change entire industries — if we let them. I strongly urge you to read Hatmaker’s piece to understand some of Lensa’s red flags, especially if you care about artists being appropriately credited and paid for their work and, well, the future of creation.

        "Extracted Article": "Primer, a U.K. startup founded by alums of Braintree and PayPal that provides a drag-and-drop framework for merchants to build online payment stacks, last year raised $50 million at a $425 million valuation from investors like ICONIQ, Accel, Balderton Capital and Seedcamp a round the came amid a bullish period for e-commerce, with record-levels of buying activity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, that activity has cooled down, and so have things at this e-commerce startup. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Primer has cut a big swathe of its staff as part of a restructuring, as it looks to adjust to current market conditions and extend its runway amid what many believe will be a tough year ahead. Sources tell us that some 85 staff have been let go around one-third of the company, we understand. We can confirm that we did have a reduction in staff, a spokesperson said. Like many other firms right now, we have course-corrected heading into the new year given the economic environment and we have taken what we think are appropriate steps to account for the uncertain times ahead. The story of what is going on here bears spelling out because the same thing is likely hitting a number of startups (and bigger companies) in the industry. The long and short of it is that the wider e-commerce market has seen a major drop in activity this year as the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic or at least the acute response that involved masking, social distancing and staying away from crowded physical spaces has subsided. That activity was not what many had predicted: Many had presumed that after large numbers of people had shifted to buying online, they would never go back to the old way of doing things. That hasnt played out: People are going back to shopping in stores, but more importantly, the global economy has cooled down, inflation has gone up and people are spending less. So companies that expanded to meet demand are now retrenching. That has led to layoffs and restructuring even at some of the very biggest companies in the space that you might have thought would be best equipped to handle economic ups and downs. Amazon, for example, warned in its last quarterly earnings that sales would be lower than originally expected in the critical holiday period. It has been cutting thousands of employees and rationalizing some of its most costly product areas. You may have recently seen that some of the gloomiest predictions were not borne out during the bellwether Black Friday and subsequent first weekend of holiday sales. But a good part of that activity has been attributed to retailers offering large discounts to spur buying, so margins will be hit longer term. This is not just playing out at the larger end of the retail market smaller sellers and the many providers of tech to the industry will also be feeling the drop. Primers unique selling point is that it has built a very simple, no-code interface that reduces what is usually a very complicated, fragmented process building a payments stack and flow around online purchasing, which includes not just the basic transaction but potentially different payment options, adding loyalty or discount codes, upselling to other products, managing customer information, verifying against fraud and much more into a set of drag and drop boxes for its customers both to call in more features and visualize how they would work together. It offers integrations for dozens of different services, underscoring just how fragmented the space is. “We are building out a whole suite in the next year to aid merchants with operations and the observability of the payment stack,” said Paul Anthony, Prime’s co-founder and CEO, in an interview with TechCrunch last year. However, a source tells us that while the process was seamless to order up, implementing it was not quite as automatic and quick. They are signing merchants but getting them live is a long process, they said. They do not generate revenue until they are live. Hence, they reduced teams until they solve this bottleneck. Given the pressures many startups are seeing with fundraising right now, the first thing to do is not to raise more money to extend runway, but to cut costs to extend what you already have in the bank, and thats what Primer has done here. Sources tell us that Primers aim with this restructuring is to extend its runway to more than two years (which it believes it has done). Its plan now is to continue investing in product with expansions on that front planned for next year. As in any downturn, there is an argument to be made for more automation in any process to cut down costs and especially in the case of e-commerce put more efficient tech in place to speed up and close more sales. But that only stands if the tech is up to the challenge, and if target customers are in a position to invest in improvements themselves. Thats the opportunity but also curse of working in any ecosystem. Primers aim is to come out as one of the helpers (and winners) in that process. Given the challenging economic environment, we believe Primer is more valuable to merchants and partners than ever before as they look to increase efficiency within their organisations, lower costs, build greater customer loyalty, and launch in new markets and do this in a no-code/automated fashion, the spokesperson said. While these are always difficult decisions to make, we feel confident this recalibration will not affect the level of service we offer to our current and prospective merchants and partners.",

        "Extracted Article": "Brodmann17, an Israeli computer vision technology startup that developed a novel approach to take on a marketplace dominated by Mobileye, shut down this week. Brodmann17s co-founder and CEO Adi Pinhas posted a message on LinkedIn announcing the move, stating that while the company would not be able to bring its products to the mass market as hoped, we do get comfort that our innovation will hopefully influence the market thinking and others will proceed in the mission of creating safer mobility to everyone. In a subsequent interview, Pinhas told TechCrunch that there is a strong feeling of sorrow as we proved the technology, there is outstanding demand and we have customers in production. Brodmann17, named after the primary visual cortex in the human brain, was launched six years ago by Pinhas, a deep learning and computer vision specialist, and AI scientists Amir Alush and Assaf Mushinsky. The trio focused their efforts on developing a new approach to computer vision technology designed to support advanced driver assistance systems. Computer vision systems are considered a critical component to automated driving features. This multibillion-dollar market promises to only get bigger as automakers shift away from its autonomous vehicle goals and instead toward near-term revenue products like advanced driver assistance systems. Brodmann17 knew it couldnt compete with Mobileye on its front-facing camera unless it could bring a new angle to the tech, Pinhas said. So we focused on the blue ocean, he added. That blue ocean was to develop deep learning-based computer vision technology that isnt reliant on bulky hardware. This lightweight software-based product was able to run on low-end processors in the car itself and was designed to complement sensors like cameras, radar and even lidar already on the vehicle. Brodmann17 applied its technology to blind-spot wing cameras, surround and rear cameras, video telematics and even two wheelers, Pinhas said. The demand in the market is far more diversified than people think, he said. We decided to take the road not taken by many other companies in the ecosystem. We just needed more time. The startup did attract investors during its lifetime. Brodmann17 raised $11 million in a Series A round back in 2019 that was led by OurCrowd. Maniv Mobility, AI Alliance, UL Ventures, Samsung NEXT and the Sony Innovation Fund also participated. Brodmann17 nabs $11M for its automotive computer vision tech that runs on any CPU But the company struggled to get new funding. Even though the team was very lean, with fewer than 30 people, Pinhas said it was impossible to continue without support from private and corporate venture capital firms. He added that everyone is waiting for next year and for something to happen before making more investments. Brodmann17 did attract some interest as a possible acquisition target. There were several offers, but all of those fell through, due mostly to timing reasons, he added. Despite the gloomy news, Pinhas said he is ready for another project. I love deep tech and creating new products, he said, without elaborating on what he might focus. Life is too short for a break.",

        "Extracted Article": "Just days ago, Airtable published a memo about how laid off workers can use Airtable to search for jobs. “It’s been an unwelcome theme of 2022—layoffs,” the post said. “Each season seems to usher in a new wave of cuts. Meanwhile, corporations cite similar concerns of rising inflation, the looming threat of an economic downturn and the need for stability during turbulent times. For the souls who lost their jobs this year it’s another cruel uncertainty they’ll have to surmount.” Airtable chief revenue officer, chief people officer and chief product officer are out Now, Airtable’s employees are facing the same feeling. Last valued at $11 billion, the no-code leader has conducted a round of layoffs today that impact around 254 employees across business development, engineering and other teams. The company spokesperson says that Airtable is continuing to hire for strategically important roles, and that 20% of the staff was impacted today. (Update: The layoff was announced internally alongside an executive departure. Airtables chief revenue officer, chief people officer and chief product officer have all parted ways with the company, effective today, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch.) Those impacted by Airtable’s layoffs today will get at least 16 weeks of severance pay, accelerated equity vesting and, for those on a visa, support from an immigration counsel, sources say. Employees were given the opportunity to meet 1:1 with a leader at the company, following the news. In an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch, and first seen by tracker Layoffs.fyi, Airtable founder and CEO Howie Liu said the company will be evolving from a bottoms-up adopted product to a company that brings connected apps to larger enterprises. “We’ve rapidly expanded and executed on multiple fronts. At the time, I believed we could successfully pursue all of them in parallel,” Liu wrote in the email. “However, in taking a hard look at our efforts in the current market environment, we’ve identified the teams best positioned to capture the opportunity in enterprise in order to bring complete focus, alignment and accountability in our execution.” The vision was part of the reason that TechCrunch spoke to Liu in October, as Airtable announced its more integrated, connected-apps approach. Then, the entrepreneur pointed to its $735 million Series F round from 2021 as a fortunate reason that Airtable has been able to stay well-capitalized amid the downturn. “We have more than enough runway to get to profitability and then some,” Liu said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We’re a private company, so we’re not under the gun to show short-term results of profitability so we’re very, very fortunate to not be under so much pressure and we would never gloat about that, but I do think it gives us a unique position [to hire talent]. In todays internal memo, Liu re-emphasized that Airtable is well capitalized, but slightly shifted in tone by adding that being a lean organization becomes doubly important in times of economic uncertainty. A spokesperson added that all of Airtables funds from its Series F are still intact. The company is signaling that the layoff was less of a desperate attempt to extend runway, and more of a move made in order to re-align the company with what actually works. A spokesperson said that its enterprise side, which makes up the majority of Airtables revenue, is growing more than 100% year over year; the product move today just doubles down on that exact cohort. This entire year was full of tech layoffs, but the final quarter has been especially massive as macroeconomic pressure reaches late-stage private companies. Yesterday, Plaid announced that it would officially cut 20% of staff, around a month after one of the most valuable fintechs, Stripe, cut 14% of its workforce. Elon Musk cut around 50% of Twitter’s workforce after he bought the social media platform, one of the largest layoffs percentage-wise that has happened since the beginning of the pandemic. Like others, Airtable is assuming a leaner, more focused business strategy to head into the new year.

        "Extracted Article": "Fintech decacorn Plaid is laying off 260 employees, or about 20% of its workforce, the company announced today. While specific details around who exactly was affected remain unknown, sources in recent months had told TechCrunch that the San Francisco-based startup’s engineering team was likely to take a big hit. In March, Plaid CTO Jean-Denis Greze told TechCrunch that he grew his engineering team 17.5x in just four years, from 20 engineers to 350 people. Today’s cut likely reverses some of that hyper-growth. A company spokesperson did not disclose how many engineers are being impacted, saying teams across the company were affected. She added that since Plaid is “aligning to updated headcount goals, teams like recruiting are impacted more than others.” In a letter to employees that was posted on Plaid’s website, CEO and co-founder Zach Perret said the company saw a rapid increase in usage by its existing customers, a large number of new customers and “substantial revenue acceleration” during COVID. As such, the company “hired aggressively” to meet customer demand and invest in new products. However, macroeconomic shifts resulted in Plaid customers experiencing slower-than-expected growth, causing the company to backpedal. The simple reality is that due to these macroeconomic changes, our pace of cost growth outstripped our pace of revenue growth. I made the decision to hire and invest ahead of revenue growth, and the current economic slowdown has meant that this revenue growth did not materialize as quickly as expected. All impacted employees will get 16 weeks of base pay in severance. Those who have been with Plaid for more than one year will get additional weeks. Plaid will also be paying the cash equivalent of six months of healthcare premiums for medical, dental and vision insurance coverage for employees and their dependents. In a practice that is becoming increasingly common, the company is also accelerating equity grants for employees who worked at the company for more than one year to the February 15, 2023 vesting date. It is also waiving the one-year cliff for workers with equity who havent yet reached their one-year vesting cliff. Additionally, it says it will provide six months of career support and coaching services as well as six months of continued mental health coverage for all departing employees. The company also says it has “dedicated immigration counsel” for those on a work visa. Affected employees lost access to many Plaid systems in a move that Perret acknowledged may seem “abrupt” but that he deemed necessary “given the sensitive nature of data” in its industry. In April of 2021, Plaid raised a $425 million Series D led by Altimeter Capital, which valued the company at around $13.4 billion. This was after its deal to be acquired by Visa for $5.3 billion fell through due to regulatory concerns. A lot has happened since that lofty valuation and Plaid is now directly competing with one of its partners, payments giant Stripe which recently conducted layoffs of its own, letting go of more than 1,100 people. Earlier this year, Stripe announced a new product called Financial Connections, which gives Stripe’s customers a way to connect directly to their customer’s bank accounts, to access financial data to speed up or run certain kinds of transactions. Sound familiar? Then two weeks later, Plaid announced it was officially expanding from its core product of account linking — its first major expansion since its 2013 inception. Specifically, the startup said it was moving into identity and income verification, fraud prevention and providing new tools for account funding and disbursements a move that put it into even deeper competition with Stripe. For its part, Stripe was last valued at $95 billion when it closed on a $600 million funding round in March of 2021. More recently, Plaid announced that it had named Meta veteran John Anderson to serve as its new head of payments as it began personally facilitating payments through its Transfer offering, in addition to facilitating its partners’ payments. Plaid’s layoff comes amid an especially tumultuous year for fintech startups. Besides Stripe, neobank Chime recently laid off 12% of its staff, or some 160 workers.

        "Extracted Article": "Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company valued at $2.2 billion last year, has laid off a portion of its workforce. Yesterday, a few affected and non-affected employees took to LinkedIn to reveal the news. TechCrunch has learned from sources that more than 50 employees were affected across multiple departments; the engineering team took the biggest hit, with around 60% of those laid off coming from the department, according to people familiar with the matter. This morning a significant amount of Chipper staff were let go in a layoff. While I was not among them, many of my close colleagues and friends were. If youre looking for talented engineering leadership, engineers, technical program managers, analysts, or IT staff, Erin Fusaro, the VP of Engineering at Chipper Cash said in her LinkedIn post. Per LinkedIn, Chipper Cash has about 400 employees, so the layoffs affected 12.5% of its workforce. TechCrunch reached out to Chipper Cash for comment. Last November, the African cross-border payments company raised $150 million in a Series C extension round led by Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX. The investment came barely six months after Chipper Cash closed its first Series C round of $100 million, led by SVB Capital, the corporate venture capital arm of SVB Financial Group. Since its inception, Chipper Cash has raised more than $305 million from investors, including Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital and Bezos Expeditions. FTX processed billions monthly in Africa before going bust CEO Ham Serunjogi founded Chipper Cash with Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer a no-fee peer-to-peer cross-border payment service in Africa via its app. Its services are used across seven African countries — Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. The company began making strides outside the continent last year. It expanded to the U.K. allowing people to send money from the European nation to Chipper Cash’s African markets and the U.S. to facilitate peer-to-peer money movement from the U.S. to Nigeria and Uganda. Chipper Cash says it has 5 million users across these markets. Layoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations. Economic headwinds have hit the global fintech space hard. Companies such as Stripe and Klarna have had to lay off employees and prune their valuations. While there have been whispers of African unicorns slashing valuations internally, only half of this trend has publicly manifested itself so far within this select group. This June, Wave, an African unicorn that offers mobile money services in part of Francophone Africa, laid off about 15% of its workforce. Chipper Cash has joined the fray with this news. SWVL, 54gene, Sendy and Twiga are examples of mid-to-large-sized companies on the continent that have also trimmed their workforce. 54gene valuation slashed by over $100M amid job cuts and CEO exit SWVL reduces its headcount by 50% six months after axing 400+ staff If you want to contact us with a story tip, you can do so securely here.",

The companys website is offline and reportedly orders have gone unfulfilled for months. TechCrunch has reached out to the eponymous founder for confirmation, but it sure looks like the end of the line for a briefly promising high-tech sex toy enterprise. Founded in 2017, Lora DiCarlo was one of a new wave of tech-forward sexual health companies headed up by women. It won an innovation award at CES 2019 for, as our writer put it at the time, a hands-free device that uses biomimicry and robotics to help women achieve a blended orgasm by simultaneously stimulating the G-spot and the clitoris. But then the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, withdrew the award and banned the company from exhibiting at the show. Their explanation at the time was that neither the company nor its devices fit a product category. Predictably, this attracted immediate blowback and allegations of sexism, prudery and generally bad judgment. Everyone was on Lora DiCarlos side, and the publicity was invaluable, she later told TechCrunch at Disrupt: I think they actually did us a pretty big favor. The company raised $2 million around that time, and about $9 million total over its five years of operation. But despite a big return to the show in 2020 (and a coveted TC+ feature, of course), the company seems to have faltered during the pandemic — perhaps falling victim to the same chip shortages and manufacturing problems even established hardware makers encountered. A sex tech startup’s triumphant return to CES As chronicled by Womens Health, the last few months seem to have been Lora DiCarlos last, as various aspects of a functioning commercial enterprise began to fail: orders werent going out, stock was gone at retail partners and personnel have left. The site went down earlier this month and is down still. Although there has not been any official announcement, it certainly does seem that the company is kaput. Its too bad, but finding success as a hardware startup is hard enough without a pandemic and the stigma on sex toys adding drag. Well update this article if we hear back from DiCarlo.",

        "Extracted Article": "A little over a year after buzzy coding bootcamp Lambda School rebranded as Bloom Institute of Technology, the venture-backed startup is conducting massive layoffs, according to sources. The workforce reduction, per people familiar with the matter, has impacted half of the companys staff across content, product, data and engineering teams. The layoff is expected to have impacted around 88 employees, using metrics provided in BloomTechs 2022 diversity report metrics. Employees were called into an All Hands meeting this morning in which BloomTech CEO Austen Allred notified staff of the impending layoffs. After the meeting, those impacted were notified via e-mail. According to documents seen by TechCrunch, employees will get normal pay and medical benefits until January 31, 2023 and are expected to work through that period. Those laid off were also offered optional time with managers to talk. This is the company’s third round of known layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic began. During BloomTech’s last big layoff, in April 2021, Allred admitted that it’s been difficult to make his for-profit company’s vision of “incentive-aligned education work.” In a now-deleted tweet posted earlier today, Allred quoted a prior statement of gratitude for employees pushing through the work despite being attacked from all sides, adding “even more so today.” The name change to BloomTech appeared to be part of the companys attempt to get things back on track. At the time, the startup updated its tuition payment options to introduce an outcomes-based loan. The financing instrument allows students to take a loan with zero dollars upfront, and then get 110% of their tuition refunded, including fees and interest from an approved lender, if they are unable to secure a job in web development or computer science within the next year. At the time, the move meant that BloomTech was expanding beyond the original vision of scaling income-sharing agreements (ISAs), the controversial financing vehicle that it helped pioneer. ISAs, which are used between 90% to 100% of students within BloomTech’s cohorts, will continue to be offered as an option, with some changes. Fast-forward to today, and the current state of the tech labor market doesn’t make BloomTech’s mission any easier. The widespread layoffs within tech companies have unlocked a massive market of trained professionals looking for their next gig; all potential competition for BloomTech graduates hoping to stand out against ex-Twitter and ex-Stripe employees. Career Karma, a platform that helps connect students to coding bootcamps, cut staff this year, while Flockjay pivoted away from its bootcamp pitch in 2021. Market uncertainty is certainly one factor that impacts outcomes, but BloomTech has also been embroiled in a number of lawsuits over the past few years led by students who claim to have been misled by the institution. BloomTechs pitch is that it can help students land tech jobs, but questions have arisen about what happens when students get jobs after graduating from BloomTechs program that are unrelated to their studies there, and whether they still owe the company a share of their resulting income. These tensions have grown over the years. Most recently, reports one education publication, a student accused BloomTech of intentionally misrepresenting its job placement rates. Last year, leaked documents obtained by Business Insider raised questions about the company inflating its efficacy and hyping up a curriculum that didn’t upskill folks at the level expected. Allred responded to request for comment days after publication, saying that BloomTechs employees are fantastic. We had to cut costs to become profitable. You should hire them.",

        "Extracted Article": "Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture developing autonomous vehicle technology, cut its workforce this week — the latest example of layoffs in the AV industry and more broadly in the tech sector. Employees were told of the layoffs Wednesday, according to sources who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak for the company. Motional, which employs more than 1,500 people globally, confirmed the layoffs. Motional did not confirm the number of employees affected. Sources said dozens of employees were laid off with cuts happening across its operations. Motional has offices in Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, South Korea, Singapore and several cities in California, including Milpitas and Santa Monica. Motional recently announced steps to reallocate resources to areas of the company that will help ensure long-term commercial success, a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. As the organization evolves, we will continue to hire the critical talent needed to develop our technology and meet our commitments to our partners. With our recent partnership announcements and the achievement of technology milestones, we are confident this shift will position us for a strong future. The company said it is providing severance packages and outplacement support to help in their transition. Layoffs have become commonplace in the tech industry this year. The autonomous vehicle sector has been especially hard hit as the high development costs and lack of revenue — never mind profits — has left companies with dwindling cash. Investors, once ready to plow money into this frontier tech, are now looking for safer, nearer term bets. In November, AV delivery startup Nuro laid off about 300 people, or 20% of its workforce, in an effort to preserve cash amid a stormy economic outlook. Argo AI, the AV startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen, also laid off employees earlier this summer. Several months later, Argo abruptly shut down after its two backers declined to invest more capital into the enterprise and shift its resources to advanced driver assistance systems. While Motional didnt provide a reason for its reallocation of resources, other AV companies have cited uncertain economic conditions as well as over-hiring in 2021 as a primary reason. Even AV companies that have yet to lay off employees are feeling pressure to cut costs. Aurora Innovation, a startup-turn-SPAC, presented a swath of cost-cutting and cash-generating options to its board earlier this year, ranging from a hiring freeze and spinning out assets to a small capital raise, going private and even selling itself to high-profile tech companies Apple and Microsoft. Motional, like many of its remaining AV competitors, has focused its commercialization efforts on launching robotaxi services. The company sees partnerships as a key piece of its go-to-market strategy and has agreements with Lyft, Uber and Via.",

        "Extracted Article": "Lyst, the U.K. fashion e-commerce site that last year raised funding at a $700 million valuation, is the latest tech startup to rein in spending by cutting staff. TechCrunch has learned that the company is in the process of laying off 25% of its employees, working out to about 50 people, as part of a larger restructuring to conserve cash flow and move to profitability. The details were first leaked to us by way of an internal memo from the CEO, Emma McFerran, who took over the role of CEO from founder Chris Morton in July of this year. The company then confirmed the details to us. Its not clear which departments will be most impacted, but the memo notes that some 85 people are being contacted who will be impacted by this exercise. We understand from sources that the company had plans for an IPO next year but that these are now being pushed back, and that it might be looking for another round of funding to shore up its finances. Lyst last raised money in May 2021, when the picture for e-commerce was rosily tinted, one of the ironic bright business spots in the largely otherwise devastating COVID-19 pandemic: fashion retailers in particular were seeing record-breaking revenues and business growth online as consumers turned away from shopping in person and used disposable income that they were no longer spending on going out. That made for buoyant sales, as well as very bullish prognostications: consumer shoppers, observers said, were unlikely to go back to physical shopping in the same numbers even after the pandemic subsided. Lyst was a product of that: When it announced its $85 million raise, it planned for that to be its last fundraise ahead of an IPO, which it was planning potentially for London or New York as soon as this year. At the time it said it had 150 million users and a catalog of 8 million products from 17,000 brands and retailers. That list of brands includes a number of high-end labels such as Balenciaga, Balmain, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Fendi, Gucci, Moncler, Off-White, Prada, Saint Laurent and Valentino, and that combined with an active audience of shoppers led the company to strong growth. In 2020, gross merchandise value on Lyst was over $500 million. Between then and 2021, new user numbers grew 1,100%, and by the time the round was announced, GMV was at more than $2 billion. Fast-forward to today and the most optimistic and bullish prognostications in e-commerce have failed to play out: online sales have not continued with torrid growth, and people generally havent been spending as much online with the return to in-store shopping. That has led to some business contractions across the board. Amazon, the biggest of all e-commerce operations (which has been working to build out a strong line in fashion) may lay off as much as 10,000 staff and are cutting a lot of product lines. A more direct rival of Lysts, the high-end fashion e-commerce poster child Farfetch, currently has a market cap of just $2.9 billion, a giant drop compared to the $14 billion it commanded in May 2021. Many look to the holiday season as a critical indicator of how well e-commerce companies are doing in the current economy, and this year, so far, the figures are actually not as bad as many thought they would be: Adobes tracking of sales have shown big days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday both breaking sales records (respectively over $9 billion and over $11 billion). Cyber Monday online sales hit a record $11.3B, driven by demand, not just inflation, says Adobe Lyst itself has been seeing strong sales to kick off holiday shopping, posting its most profitable Black Friday weekend ever, with average order value up 15% albeit with more discounting across the brands and stores that sell on the site to gin up activity. But the bigger picture and the longer-term view are the factors driving todays news. In addition to a focus on getting profitable, our source tells us that Lysts IPO was more recently targeted for 2023, but those plans have now been pushed back, and that its looking to do a new round of funding partly because its low on cash flow. (To be clear, the company would not comment on these facts.) Well update this post as we learn more. If you want to contact us with a story tip, you can do so securely here.",

The Bengaluru-based startup informed impacted employees on Friday and separately held a town hall meeting on Monday where it announced pay cuts to its remaining staff, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Its a major turn for VerSe Innovation, which is backed by the likes of Google and Microsoft and raised more than $800 million in fresh funding as recently as April of this year. The change speaks to just how much the bottom has fallen out from under the advertising market, how thats impacting high-profile consumer businesses reliant on it and how thats stretching to even some of the fastest-growing digital markets like India. Given the current economic climate, like other businesses, we’ve evaluated our strategic priorities. Considering the long-term viability of the business and our people, we have taken steps to implement our regular bi-annual performance management cycle and made performance and business considerations to streamline our costs and our teams, said Umang Bedi, co-founder of VerSe Innovation, in a prepared statement responding to queries originally sent on Saturday. He also confirmed that the startup implemented an 11% salary cut for all remaining employees with salaries above $12,200 (10 lakh Indian rupees) per annum. We remain extremely committed and bullish across our entire family of apps — Josh, Dailyhunt and PublicVibe — to drive profitable growth, he said. In April, VerSe Innovation raised $805 million at a nearly $5 billion valuation in a Series J round led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board (Ontario Teachers’), Luxor Capital, Sumeru Ventures, Sofina Group and Baillie Gifford. The startup at the time said that its Josh app — one of the local alternatives to TikTok, which India banned in mid-2020 — had climbed to over 150 million users, including 50 million creators. Similarly, Dailyhunt grew its creator ecosystem to over 100,000 content partners and crossed the mark of 350 million users, while PublicVibe expanded its user base to more than 5 million monthly active users. Nonetheless, that growth did not help VerSe Innovation offset its losses. In its regulatory filings, which Entrackr reported, the startup noted that its losses in the financial year 2021-22 grew over 217% to $314 million (2,563 crores Indian rupees) from $99 million (808 crores Indian rupees) in the previous year. However, its operating revenue reportedly increased about 45% to $118 million (965 crores Indian rupees) from $82 million (666 crores Indian rupees). VerSe Innovation has become the latest Indian startup to cut its workforce due to ongoing economic uncertainties. In the last couple of months, Byjus, Unacademy and Chargebee, among others, have laid off hundreds of employees.",

        "Extracted Article": "Cairo-born and Dubai-based mass transit and shared mobility services provider SWVL has carried out its second round of layoffs affecting 50% of its remaining headcount, according to a statement shared by the company. The news is coming six months after SWVL laid off 32% of its workforce in a “portfolio optimization program” effort geared toward achieving positive cash flow next year. More than 400 employees were affected at the time, leaving more than 900 behind at the mobility company, based on data from its LinkedIn profile. But with this second round of layoffs, the number of employees at SWVL would have been reduced to a little over 450. Reports about a second round of layoffs at SWVL had been circulating for over two weeks as axed employees took to LinkedIn to share that they were open to new job opportunities. Local media said the layoffs affected teams across multiple departments, including tech and HR in Dubai and Pakistan. Another report has it that SWVL completely shuttered its Pakistan operations entirely two weeks ago. Although SWVL, in its statement, didn’t confirm these reports, it did note that it was evaluating a “potential sale, scale back or discontinuation of operations” of its smaller markets. It’s unclear which markets the Dubai-based mobility company is referring to, but several sources have referred to Pakistan as one of its larger markets. As of June, SWVL, in its financial statement to investors, said it was present in 20 markets across four continents: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Chile, France, the U.K., Portugal and Brazil. SWVL went into some of these markets via acquisitions: Germany’s door2door, Turkey’s Voltlines, Mexico’s Urbvan, Spain’s Shotl and Argentina’s Viapool (its planned acquisition of U.K.-based Zeelo was called off in July). When SWVL conducted its first round of layoffs, it said that though the acquisitions contributed to its overall growth, it needed to make reductions on roles automated by investments in its engineering, product and support functions teams. However, the second round of layoffs reveals a different story: the current economic downturn has exposed that SWVL scaled too fast and didn’t have the necessary systems in place to make the acquisitions work. SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going public SWVL’s sloppy operations despite claiming that it turned EBITDA-positive or break-even in half of its markets as of August are also evident in its stock market performance so far. In March, the mobility company went public via a SPAC merger with U.S. women-led blank check company Queen’s Gambit Growth Capital. It listed at $9.95 per share on Nasdaq and targeted a $1.5 billion valuation. Several months later, SWVL has seen its valuation tank to $53 million and its share price drop by over 90% to $0.40 (price before the market opening). As a result, SWVL received a letter from Nasdaq this month saying it was not in compliance with a listing rule (its shares traded below $1 for 30 consecutive business days) and it had until May 1, 2023 (180 days) to regain compliance and avoid delisting (it must get its shares above $1). Cutting costs is one way SWVL believes will, in some way, affect its share price. The Dubai-based company stated it is taking these measures amid the continuing uncertainty in the global economic environment as the volatility in capital markets “potentially impact SWVL’s ability to generate sufficient cash from operating activities and external financings to fund working capital and service its commitments.” The company, in the statement, said it is also reducing operating expenses including discretionary spending such as marketing expenses and other third-party services. Going forward, SWVLs broader optimization plan is to sharpen its focus on its largest markets which contribute the most to its revenues, including Egypt and Mexico. For the first half of the year, SWVL made $40.7 million in revenue, a 3.2x growth from H1 2021; however, its losses (including operating loss and recapitalization costs) during this same time amounted to over $161.6 million.

        "Extracted Article": "Jumia, as part of its streamlining efforts, reduced headcount among managerial roles by 60% in Dubai and undertook overall headcount reductions that resulted in more than 900 position terminations across its 11 markets, affecting 20% of its staff. This occurred in Q4 last year, according to Jumia’s FY2022 financials. This news follows Jumia Supervisory Board’s note on performing more senior management shake-ups when it appointed Francis Dufay as acting CEO last November in a bid to “pick leaders and decision centers closer to consumers and sellers in Africa” and Dufay’s first interview with TechCrunch where he mentioned that Jumia had begun to make those changes. According to the then-acting-CEO, a handful of contracts had been terminated from the company’s Dubai office while those who remained relocated to various African offices. He also told TechCrunch that Jumia was preparing to make significant staff reductions across 11 markets by the end of 2022. Jumia to cut products and overhead as new management chases profits It’s too early to tell how far the changes will affect the e-commerce giant’s bottom line, given how it has endured years of unending losses. For one, the company has recorded back-to-back losses every quarter since it went public in 2019; it finished 2022 with $207 million in adjusted EBITDA losses, a 5.3% rise from the $196 million it recorded the year before. Yet, there are reasons for investors to be optimistic. Between October 2022 and now, the headcount reductions and changes made by the new administration after their first 100 days allowed Jumia to save over 30% in monthly staff costs. “The implementation of these organizational changes resulted in $3.7 million in one-off restructuring costs booked in the fourth quarter of 2022,” the company’s statement added. Also, Jumia’s adjusted EBITDA loss has decreased in the last two quarters since new management took over. The company now expects to reduce losses by as much as 50% and end this year with about $100-120 million in losses. In other cost-cutting measures, Jumia has finalized some business exits it announced it would make in Q3 and Q4 2022; the e-tailer took these measures to improve resource allocation and focus on core areas with attractive investment returns. Jumia Prime will be discontinued across all its markets. The company will also suspend its logistics-as-a-service in all markets except Nigeria, Morocco and Ivory Coast. Then, it will scale back first-party groceries in Algeria, Ghana, Senegal and Tunisia. It will also discontinue food delivery operations in Egypt, Ghana and Senegal. The company stated these activities accounted for less than 1% of group GMV in the first nine months of 2022 and 2% of group adjusted EBITDA loss. Jumia reports record orders and revenue but investors remain unconvinced Meanwhile, quarterly active customers on Jumia dipped 15% from 3.8 million in Q4 2021 to 3.2 million customers in Q4 2022. Jumia said this happened because the economic environment in the countries it operates in limited how much users could spend. It also pointed to a deliberate reduction in how it promoted product categories with “challenging unit economics.” The company also noticed declines in orders, gross merchandise value and total payment value from Q4 2021. Orders reduced 12.5% from 11.3 million to 9.9 million; GMV. 14% from 330.1 million to 283.1 million; and TPV, 18% from 90.5 million to 73.9 million. Despite the drop in metrics that Jumia had steadily grown over the past couple of quarters, its revenue stayed on course and witnessed a 7.1% year-on-year increase from 62 million in Q4 21 to 66.5 million in Q4 22. Also, gross profit increased 21.9% year-on-year as operating loss saw a 41% drop. In 2021, Jumia finished with $512.8 million ($117.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $395.7 million of term deposits and other financial assets). By the end of 2022, its liquidity had reduced by more than 50% to $227.8 ($72.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $155.7 million of term deposits and other financial assets). Shares of the Africa-focused and U.S.-headquartered e-commerce company fell about 10% to about $3.78 at the time of publication. And to some promising news, Dufay after replacing the company’s co-founders last November and spending three months as acting CEO of Jumia has been appointed Jumia CEO. As such, “the executive search that was being conducted has now been concluded,” the company said in its full-year 2022 financials. “The appointment reflects the strong confidence of the Board in the leadership of Francis and his ability to successfully scale the business to profitability.” Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec step down as Jumia co-CEOs",

Several Nuro employees also posted on Twitter and LinkedIn this morning that they had been affected by the layoffs. In the email viewed by TechCrunch, co-founders Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson informed employees they would receive an update later this morning letting them know if they are impacted by this layoff and with information on next steps. The co-founders said they take responsibility for the layoffs, which were the result of over-hiring in 2021 smacking into economic headwinds in 2022: Each and every one of you have made important contributions to this company, and saying goodbye to talented Nurons is not a decision we have taken lightly. For those of you leaving Nuro, we are very sorry for this outcome this is not the experience we wanted to create for you. We made this call and take full responsibility for todays circumstances. Ferguson and Zhu wrote that in 2021, it was the strongest fundraising environments in history. We saw an abundant supply of capital for deep tech companies and almost all companies were aggressively hiring and expanding, they wrote, adding that, In that environment, we determined it made sense to invest heavily across the board and grow our team rapidly. Exactly one year ago, Nuro raised $600 million in a fundraising round led by new investor Tiger Global Management. The Series D round, which pushed its valuation to about $8.6 billion, attracted high-profile investors including Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Google, China-based venture firm Gaorong Capital, grocery retailer Kroger, SoftBank Vision Fund 1, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Woven Capital, a venture arm of Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet. That led the company to double the size of its team in less than two years and significantly increased operating expenses based on an assumption that the funding environment would remain robust. This was a mistake, they wrote. Macroeconomic conditions in 2022, which include inflation and an impending U.S. recession, prompted the founders to slash costs, including cutting its workforce in an effort to extend its capital runway into 2025. Nuro still has more than $1 billion on its balance sheet, the pair wrote. Laid-off workers are being offered 12 weeks of severance pay and up to 14 weeks for those who have been with the company more than two years. The company will also pay out bonuses to those who are eligible, and are waiving the one-year vesting cliff on the equity front. Nuro will subsidize 100% of COBRA healthcare premiums (including families) through March 31, 2023, will provide career transition support and visa holders will also receive some notice period to ease this transition and, if applicable, travel assistance, the email said. While the company has made progress and is operating in Houston, Palo Alto and Mountain View, California, its also pulled back operations in at least one area. The company closed its Phoenix facility this summer as it shifted its commercial strategy away from the desert metropolis and toward the San Francisco Bay Area and Houston.",

        "Extracted Article": "Kenya’s B2B e-commerce food distribution platform Twiga has laid off 211 of its full-time employees following restructuring that has eliminated the company’s in-house sales team. The laid-off staff make up 21% of the over 1,000 employees mainly in Kenya, where it links farmers or agricultural producers and fast-moving consumer goods manufactures to retailers. The agritechs CEO and co-founder Peter Njonjo told TechCrunch that the laid-off trade development representatives (TDRs) were given the option of working for the company as independent agents with pay based on the customers they acquire and sales they make. The representatives signed up vendors and were in charge of customer relations, gathering market intelligence and promoting products to clients. In the current proposition, the agents will carry out similar duties. Reports also state that Twiga has limited its staff travel allowances as part of its cost-cutting measures. “Twiga recently launched a new optimized sales agents’ program … where current trade development representatives will transition from permanent employees into independent agents on a 100% commission basis,” said Twiga in response to a TechCrunch inquiry, adding that the transition of the TDRs was made in line with labor laws and that impacted employees were granted the first right of refusal to transition to the new model. Twiga starts commercial farming, looking to guarantee quality, sustain supply The company says it plans to create 1,000 opportunities through the agent model by the end of next year’s first quarter. “This transition creates an opportunity for entrepreneurship open to former sales agents and the general public. The benefit of this transition is that it allows for higher earnings based on the effort and enterprise of the agent. This model has worked with other businesses like insurance and banking that have transitioned fully into Independent Agents in Kenya.” Twiga, co-founded by Njonjo and Grant Brooke in 2014, joins the growing list of startups in Africa and across the globe downsizing amid a slowdown in VC funding, which has made capital for operations and growth hard to access. The changes come exactly a year after Twiga raised $50 million in series C round to scale in Kenya and expand to neighboring countries. The round was led by Paris- and Nairobi-based family office and private equity firm Creadev as TLcom Capital, IFC Ventures, DOB Equity and Goldman Sachs’ spinoff Juven made follow-on investments. They also recently launched Twiga Fresh, an addition to its private label through which it will farm and distribute its own agricultural produce to traders and to deal with traceability challenges, stock outs and price volatility — which have made it hard for the company to deliver on its promise of affordability and food security.

        "Extracted Article": "African web3 startup Nestcoin has laid off some employees as FTXs demise impacted its business. This information was shared by the startups CEO, Yele Bademosi, who, in a tweet, said FTXs fall from grace affected his one-year-old startup, which held assets (cash and stablecoins) in the now-defunct crypto exchange to manage operational expenses. Since Sam Bankman-Frieds crypto empire made up of FTX, Alameda Research and FTX Ventures collapsed last week, there have been various reports of companies whose money is stuck in FTX, its crypto exchange platform. Some of them include Galois Capital, a hedge fund with half of its capital stuck at the collapsed crypto exchange; Genesis Trading, which had about $175 million locked on the crypto exchange; and Multicoin Capital, the famed crypto and web3 venture capital firm that has nearly 10% of its assets under management trapped. Nestcoin joins that growing list (more names are becoming known by the day); it appears most, if not all, of its assets, are stuck in FTX. According to several reports, companies with money stuck on FTX might get their money back depending on how much FTXs assets are ultimately worth. From its 23-page bankruptcy filing, FTX has more than 100,000 creditors, with assets in the range of $10 billion to $50 billion and liabilities within the same range. Nestcoin raises $6.45M pre-seed to accelerate crypto and web3 adoption in Africa and frontier markets Nestcoin, which Bademosi described in an interview with TechCrunch as a venture collective, is one of a handful of African startups that have received venture capital from FTX and Alameda Research, alongside 200+ foreign-based startups and investment firms, including Circle and Sequoia Capital. FTX, for instance, led a $150 million Series C extension round in Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company. Alameda Research, on the other hand, has backed Nigeria- and Kenya-based web3 company MARA; South African crypto exchange startup VALR; Congolese web3 startup Jambo; and Nigerian crypto exchange platform Bitnob. Its still unclear if these other startups held their assets in FTX, but theres a slight chance that might be the case, given whats come to light with Nestcoin, even though Alameda Research, its investor, has less than 1% equity. We used the closely-associated exchange, FTX, as a custodian to store a significant proportion of the stablecoin investment we raised, i.e., our day-to-day operational budget, said Bademosi in his tweet. We were not undertaking any trading, but simply custodied our assets on the FTX exchange. While there are uncertainties, including the outcome of our assets held at FTX, we as a company have to adjust our plans, rethink our strategy and take steps to better position ourselves for the future. An update shared with our investors earlier today on the FTX incident and its impact on @Nestcoin. pic.twitter.com/0Mjo4SYF7R &mdash; YB 🟢 🟡 🔴 (@YeleBademosi) November 14, 2022 To that end, Nestcoin, which Bademosi launched last February to build, invest and operate web3 and non-custodial products for customers in frontier markets across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), media, digital art and gaming, has had to reduce its headcount. According to two people familiar with the matter, Nestcoin layoffs will affect at least 30 employees from sub-departments, including Breach, its media arm; Brunch, a group messaging app with a crypto wallet; and Metaverse Magma (MVM), a gaming DAO that raised $3.2 million at a $30 million valuation two months ago. The remaining employees will see their salaries slashed by as much as 40%, the people said. On the other hand, Nestcoin noted that its products are DeFi protocols &amp; non-custodial; thus, it has never held customer funds, and this incident has no impact on our customers financially. The rest of Bademosis tweet reads: While this is a challenging time for us and the industry as a whole we see this as a wake up call to focus on building a more decentralized crypto future where no one organization or person can amass enough power to influence a nascent industry that has the potential to do good. In the past few days Ive strengthened my resolve and remain committed to doing crypto in line with its true spirit and founding ethos. At Nestcoin we have a renewed sense of purpose we realize that for crypto to truly go mainstream, we must accelerate the transition to self custody by building compelling trustless crypt products. To succeed, we will remain relentless, resourceful and flexible as we navigate these hard times. UPDATE: Chipper Cash, MARA, Bitnob and VALR have confirmed that they had zero exposure to FTX in the wake of its crash. Read more. RIP to FTX?",

        "Extracted Article": "SoundHound — maker of the voice AI technology used by Mercedes-Benz, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Mastercard and more — has laid off about 10% of its workforce amid ongoing economic turmoil across global markets. The Santa Clara-headquartered company — which went public via a SPAC in April of this year — announced the decision to its employees on Wednesday. Alongside that, it also imposed salary cuts for some of those not laid off. The company did not specify the details of the salary cuts, nor how many were affected. Yesterday, we announced to our SoundHounders that we are taking actions to streamline our company, including an approximate 10% reduction in workforce. We dont take this lightly, but in the face of challenging market conditions, we must channel our investments into the areas that continue to drive growth and allow us to best serve our customers. Were extremely grateful to the departing colleagues that have contributed to our success as a leading voice AI platform, a SoundHound spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. SoundHound has a total headcount of 450 employees — meaning that the layoff has impacted around 45 people. The company will likely share more details during its Q3 earnings call later today. Founded in 2005, SoundHound offers its voice AI platform in 25 languages. It powers voice-enabled experiences in a number of the cars provided by Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Honda. Earlier this month, the company also tied up with Samsungs Harman International to offer fully OEM-owned and branded in-vehicle voice experience to several vehicles. Alongside offering its standalone platform to companies, SoundHound has two mobile apps, namely SoundHound Music, which works similar to Apples Shazam and lets users discover music playing around them, and Hound, which offers voice-based search and assistance. In November last year, SoundHound announced it would go public via a SPAC transaction with blank check company Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners at a nearly $2.1 billion valuation. It was over 5x what Apple paid for its competitor Shazam, a $400 million deal announced in December 2017 and closed in September 2018. But its fortunes as a public company have been mixed. In its last quarterly results for the second quarter that ended on June 30, SoundHound reported a 26% year-on-year revenue drop to $6.2 million, while Q2 net loss spiked to nearly $31 million, compared to $15 million in the same quarter a year before. And its market cap, like that of many tech companies at the moment, is not doing very well. Its currently trading at around $2/share with a market cap of $406 million. SoundHound has become another tech company to take the layoff route during this economic slowdown. In addition to recent layoffs announced by Facebook owner Meta and Twitter, others, including Netflix, Salesforce, Spotify, Tencent and many others, have cut collectively tens of thousands of jobs in the last several months. Indian startups such as Byjus, Ola and Unacademy have also laid off hundreds of employees to reduce their operating expenses amid a dip in funding and investments.",

The Vancouver-based company informed the affected employees about the move earlier this week, a person familiar with the development said. As we at Kabam reviewed our strategic priorities, we made the decision to adjust our resourcing structure in alignment with our goals. This means that while we will continue to hire in key areas in the year ahead, unfortunately, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 7%. For those we are parting ways with, we are grateful to [sic] their contributions to our success, and are supporting them through this challenging transition, a Kabam spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The company has a headcount of over 500 employees. Kabam has a catalog of mobile games generating hundreds of millions of downloads in total, including Marvel Contest of Champions, Disney Mirrorverse, Shop Titans, Transformers: Forged to Fight, Mini Guns, Fast &amp; Furious 6: The Game, Fast &amp; Furious: Legacy and Blastron. The company also has studios and offices in Montreal, San Francisco, Charlottetown, Austin and Los Angeles — alongside its headquarters in Vancouver. Founded in 2006, the gaming company ran as a startup until 2016 when it was acquired by South Koreas Netmarble Games for a reported $700 million to $800 million. In March this year, Netmarbles North American operations merged with Kabam. It aimed to bring many Netmarble game titles to western markets. Kabam is one of many companies in the tech world that have cut its workforce during this economic slowdown. In the last few days, the impact of the ongoing financial crunch was largely seen through massive layoffs announced by Twitter and Meta. Companies including Netflix, Spotify and Tencent also let some of their staff go. Similarly, Indian startups such as Unacademy, Byjus and Ola have also laid off hundreds and thousands of employees to reduce the burden of limited funding and investments.",

        "Extracted Article": "Benitago Group’s website no longer working this week set off an alarm bell for some folks, those who regularly follow the comings-and-goings of active fulfillment-by-Amazon aggregators. They believed it might spell the end for the e-commerce aggregator, which raised $380 million in equity and debt financing last year. Co-founder Benedict Dohmen confirmed to TechCrunch via a LinkedIn message that “Benitago (or any related entity) is not shutting down its operations. We have not sold or disposed of any assets.” Though the company did make a few acquisitions this year, it shifted gears toward brand incubation and operations, or essentially developing their own brands. And unfortunately, this decision led the company to cut staff. One former colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, told me they were with the company for only about three months before his department was let go. Dohmen confirmed the layoffs. “We unfortunately had to reduce the size of our teams by 14%, primarily in the M&amp;A and talent acquisition departments,” he said. “We underestimated the probability and impact of an e-commerce market downtrend. As the world has changed and market pressure for probability rose, we shifted focus towards incubation and operations.” The company was started by Benedict Dohmen and Santiago Nestares (Benitago, get it?) back when they were at Dartmouth College seven years ago. We profiled the company in March 2021 when it raised $55 million in both equity and debt to go about funding acquisitions of brands built to sell on Amazon’s marketplace. Benitago leaning into brand development was more of a return to its roots than anything, Dohmen said. The company began as an incubator and operator. It wasn’t until later in 2021, around the time the company raised a whopping $325 million in Series A equity and debt, that it developed “an acquisitive M&amp;A arm,” he added. E-commerce aggregators buy up brands from marketplaces, like Amazon and Shopify. As we’ve reported, just this week in fact, these kinds of businesses have seen their sector go from very hot two years ago to cool. Some have continued to do well, even grabbing the now random venture capital deal, while others found the funding firehose dry up. Dohmen, too, noted that the shift in strategy to focus on brand incubation and operations was “due to the increasing cost of debt.” The new focus seems to be paying off for the company now. The incubation effort accounts for 20% of Benitago’s business and is growing 88% quarter over quarter, Dohmen said. Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was up 308% from last year, and this quarter “was Benitago’s most profitable and cash-flowing quarter yet,” he added. The company has since developed five international brands, operates over 10 brands and has more than 300 new products in the pipeline. Dohmen doesn’t believe Benitago is done with M&amp;A, but does admit that future acquisitions will be “more targeted,” and instead of casting a wide net on Amazon, it “will only seek brands that fit with our current brands’ strategic direction.” “We regret being overly optimistic and not foreseeing the e-commerce downtrend and the rising cost of capital,” Dohmen said. “We take full responsibility and are sad about the reduction in team. But were excited about the brands and products we have in the pipeline, and were excited to come out of this recession much stronger.” What does the future look like for e-commerce aggregators?",

The Chennai and San Francisco-headquartered startup, which offers billing, subscription, revenue and compliance management solutions, confirmed to TechCrunch that the update impacted 142 employees. This decision was a difficult one, and we want to first acknowledge and thank the team members who helped us get where we are today. Chargebee has grown exponentially over the last few years, and amid changing market conditions, we have decided to proactively refocus resources to set a strong foundation on which to continue our growth, said Penny Desatnik, director of corporate communications at Chargebee, in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. We will continue to build and strengthen key relationships, and by focusing on efficient growth, we expect to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and operations to meet the rising market demand for subscription services across B2C and B2B businesses. We wish success to our former colleagues and remain committed to the success of our customers and partners around the globe, Desatnik added. On Wednesday, Chargebee co-founder and CEO Krish Subramanian wrote on a LinkedIn post that the startup had changed its hiring plan to align with priorities owing to the macroeconomic factors and started reducing its expenses across various areas, including tools, consulting and contractors due to a growing gap between revenue and spending. While the scaling decisions were under our control and responsibility, the economic situation and lack of visibility into the future has made it harder for everyone, the note said. The affected employees will receive three months of pay and extended medical benefits while they look for new opportunities, he added. The startup will also offer outplacement career services and an extension of time to exercise stock options granted under its stock incentive plan. Chargebee raised $250 million in a Series H round in February — over nine months after earning unicorn status following the $125 million Series G funding in April last year. The startup counts Insight Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India among its key backers. Unfavorable economic conditions have impacted several startups and tech companies around the world. In the last few months, Indian startups including Unacademy, Byjus and Ola have cut their workforces amid a significant dip in the funding. U.S. companies including digital bank Chime, online real estate marketplace Opendoor and lending giant Upstart also recently made similar decisions.",

        "Extracted Article": "There are no sure bets in this or any business. Automation, agriculture and a climate-bent are green flags, but no category is immune from mounting economic headwinds on top of the already difficult task of launching a successful startup. While robotics has thus far seen a limited slowdown in investing relative to many other sectors, there’s no such thing as a recession-proof business in startup land. Bay Area-based Iron Ox has certainly had no shortage of supporters. The agtech firm has raised north of $100 million, culminating with a $53 million Series C announced in September of last year. But earlier this week, the robotic agtech startup instituted widespread layoffs. All told, 50 jobs were cut this week, a figure that amounts to nearly half of the companys staff of just over 100 people. Chief Legal Officer Myra Pasek tells TechCrunch that the decision was made in order to extend [its] cash runway. Pasek adds: Weve decided to hyperfocus on our core competence of engineering and technology; as a result, we eliminated many roles that are not core to our renewed focus. However, the layoff was comprehensive and included positions throughout the organization i.e., not limited to only certain departments. Reducing the Iron Ox team was a painful decision one we did not take lightly. We are working with our board members and leaning into our extensive ecosystem throughout Silicon Valley to help employees find meaningful new work at mission-aligned companies. Iron Ox has always hired world-class talent, and Im confident that the individuals we unfortunately had to cut this week will have many options open to them. As a matter of policy, we are not going to provide additional details or comment on specific personnel, and we ask that you respect their privacy at this sensitive time. Its a massive blow for a well-funded firm at the cross section of several growth areas. Iron Ox’s play has focused on fully automated greenhouses, courtesy of robotic arms, Kiva-like plant moving carts and other technologies. Utilizing indoor growing techniques and a trove of data, the pitch promised broader growing seasons in more diverse climates and the utilization of less resources than standard farming, all while still harnessing the sun in a way that is often altogether removed from vertical farming. Precisely what shape the new focus will take remains to be seen, though the companys site reflects a broad range of different satellite categories, including plant and data science and robotics. Speaking with TechCrunch, Iron Ox explained that it had no intention of winding down operations, though the firm is seemingly open to both seeking additional funding and, perhaps, even a sale. [A]t Iron Ox, our attitude is that we are always willing and eager to meet with mission-aligned investors who want to decarbonize the agriculture sector, Pasek says. Like other competitive startups, we never stop fundraising. We are not talking about winding down operations we are more focused than ever on our core competencies in engineering and technology.",

        "Extracted Article": "Lending giant Upstart has laid off about 140 employees — or 7% of its total workforce — who help process loan applications, sources told TechCrunch. The cloud-based AI lending platform notified its affected employees about the layoff on Tuesday. Upstart had about 2,000 employees, according to the company, which confirmed the layoffs. Given the challenging economy, we are making this difficult decision for the long-term health of the company. We do not expect any further layoffs, and continue to hire for roles that are strategic to our business, Upstart spokesperson Mike Nelson said in a statement. Upstart said in its latest 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the decision was due to ongoing economic challenges and the reduction in the volume of loans on its platform. However, the company would not confirm the exact drop in its loan volumes. In its last quarterly results in August, the California-based company reported a 72% annual increase in loan volumes on its platform from 456,610 in the first half of 2021 to a total of 786,675 in the same period a year later. The earnings for the third quarter are due on November 8. Upstart is facing difficulties owing to weakening demand for loans in the U.S. due to significant hikes in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cope with the global rise in inflation. The companys share price dropped by 84% this year. Upstart was trading at $22.88 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. The market cap of Upstart rose to nearly $32 billion at one point after its public debut in November 2020. Since, the companys total stock value dipped to less than $2 billion earlier on Tuesday. Unfavorable economic conditions have not only impacted the lending industry but also many technology companies around the globe. Telehealth unicorn Cerebral, online real estate marketplace Zillow and SurveyMonkey parent Momentive Global have all laid off employees in recent weeks. Companies including Netflix, Spotify and Tencent also made similar decisions. Indian startups such as Byjus and Ola have also sacked their employees amid the dip in funding and investments.

The layoffs impacted Zillow Offer advisors, PA sales and back-end staff at Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services, as well as other teams. As part of our normal business process, we continuously evaluate and responsibly manage our resources as we create digital solutions to make it easier for people to move.

The company did not reveal the percentage of its workforce affected by the decision. However, in its last quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in August, Zillow reported that it had 5,791 full-time employees in its workforce. Using that figure, this layoff has impacted around 5% of employees. In November last year, Zillow announced that it would lay off a quarter of its staff — around 2,000 people — due to shutting down its home-buying service Offers that aimed to provide sellers with instant home offers.

A spokesperson for Cerebral confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch but did not share the specific number of employees affected. According to the WSJ, which first reported the news, and Insider, some 400 people will lose their jobs, primarily clinical staff and care counselors. “Today’s changes are part of Cerebral’s ongoing transformation program, which drives to create more sustainable growth and stability, while further delivering our mission to democratize access to high-quality mental health care for all,” a Cerebal spokesperson told TechCrunch. “These changes are focused specifically on realizing operational efficiencies while prioritizing clinical quality and safety across the organization.” The company did not explain what type of severance, if any, was offered to employees, but did tell TechCrunch we are doing everything we can to support our impacted colleagues as they pursue other opportunities. Cerebral’s model explains care counselors meet with patients regularly to manage medications prescribed by clinicians and provide support. How Cerebral and Alto Neuroscience embarked on an at-home clinical trial for depression The SoftBank-backed company has come under scrutiny for making it easier to provide ADHD medication to potential clients. Perhaps too easy: allegations led to an investigation by the Department of Justice into potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act for overprescribing prescriptions such as Adderall. A lawsuit was also filed against the company by Matthew Truebe, former vice president of product and engineering, alleging company higher-ups encouraged Cerebral employees to prescribe stimulants to all ADHD patients. According to a press release, the company has since stopped providing those services, citing the need to review its clinical quality and safety processes. “Based on recent feedback from stakeholders, it is clear that this has become a distraction from our focus to democratize access to mental health care services, provide treatment for more patients and add service lines for new conditions,” Robertson said in the release. The San Francisco-based company has raised more than $426 million since its founding in 2020, $300 million of which was announced in a Series C last December. Cerebral is valued at $4.8 billion, according to Behavioral Health Business. Earlier this year Cerebral laid off “hundreds” of people, primarily affecting its support and operations team to better its programs. At the time, the company did not provide any details to TechCrunch explaining any severance offered to employees.

        "Extracted Article": "Clear Capital, a real estate valuation technology company and firm, is laying off 27% of its staff months after freezing mass hiring, TechCrunch has learned from sources. A spokesperson for Clear Capital confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch but did not share the specific number of employees impacted. Last November, the company announced they had 1,400 total global employees, so using that figure the layoff could have impacted 378 employees. The reduction primarily impacted its operational team, according to sources. “Clear Capital is restructuring all company divisions to reduce expenses and support our future business strategy amidst today’s housing market reality,” said Duane Andrews, CEO of Clear Capital in a written statement to TechCrunch. “This will allow us to refocus the business on key areas and ensure we are on track for sustainable growth. The CEO also cited ”the impact of a rising interest rate environment in the mortgage industry has resulted in a significant decrease in volume from our customers,” as a reason for the layoffs. The company did not explain what type of severance, if any, was offered to employees. In an internal memo sent to employees obtained by TechCrunch, Andrews explained Clear Capital executives had anticipated a decrease in work volume over the summer but did not expect to make cuts come fall. “Keeping folks engaged and contributing was necessary; our forecasts showed that the Fall would bring increased volume,” read Andrews memo. “As we approached Fall, the markets stated indicating otherwise, and we now know volume will not return for a significant period of time.” Andrews added the decision to cut staff and locations was “a last resort” and “there are no guarantees” that further cuts won’t be made. Sources explained employees were required to attend an “abrupt” Google Meet call at 9 a.m. PST on Wednesday. Once in, they were split into two groups: those that would remain and those laid off. Employees were told back in August that there would be no layoffs, sources say. Sources declined to comment on the record due to fear of retaliation, and because they said Clear Capital advised employees not to speak to the press. According to a meeting call recording obtained by TechCrunch, Clear Capitals Vice President of Customer Success Heather Shick and Executive Vice President of Customer Experience Luke Fredrick addressed the layoffs to employees and asked for those staying to feed into their “grit.” “Everything that we planned on with this was so that we didn’t need to do it again,” Shick said, “Our goal is to not have this meeting a second time, but there is no guarantee. Your workloads are going to change. You’re going to be busier. We are all going to be busier, and its going to be tough.” Shick further explained in the call that inflation rates in the real estate investing market led to the company’s decision. Inflation rates have surged drastically after the COVID-19 pandemic and have impacted the real estate space. As the once-hot market begins to freeze, the rate hike has brought into question if there will be a potential recession. The Reno, Nevada-based company claims to be the “leader in property valuation management and data solutions,” and works as the middleman for banks, investors and homeowners. Last year, the company bought CubiCasa, a Finland-based floor planning app for iOS and Android for an undisclosed amount. Despite the company’s signs of growth, it was facing declines in customer volume to which Clear Capital cites macroeconomic conditions. Employees laid off explained that the decision was unexpected and caught them by surprise. One source told TechCrunch they “feel in shambles.” During the meeting, Clear Capital announced it would be closing its Truckee, California office and said there will be no operational staff in its Roseville, California location. Those still employed are expected to return back to in-person work on October 24.

        "Extracted Article": "Indian edtech giant Byjus said on Wednesday it will eliminate 5% of its workforce, or about 2,500 roles, across multiple departments and is cutting its marketing budgets as it looks to improve its finances and achieve profitability by end of the current financial year. This the second significant layoff the startup, valued at $22 billion, is undertaking in recent months. In June, it cut hundreds of jobs. The move comes amid the ongoing global market downturn, which has forced many startups, including Byjus, to postpone their plans to file for an initial public offering. The startup said it is retargeting its marketing budget toward more efficient growth. Since significant brand awareness has been created in India over the past few years, there is a scope to optimise marketing budgets locally and prioritise spending to increase brand awareness in overseas markets, it said in a statement. The Indian startup has moved to clear its debts and other balances in recent months. It recently cleared all its dues to Blackstone by paying $234 million it owed the global investment giant for the $1 billion acquisition of Aakash, TechCrunch reported earlier. The startup, which posted a net loss of $577.4 million, is aiming to become profitable by the end of the current financial year. It generated a gross revenue of $1.258 billion (unaudited) in the financial year that ended in March this year. Between April and July, the startup logged revenue of $570 million, it said. Byju’s counts Prosus Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia Capital India, Silver Lake, Owl Ventures, UBS and Blackrock among its backers and has raised nearly $6 billion to date. “As a mature organisation that takes its responsibility towards investors and stakeholders seriously, we aim to ensure sustainable growth alongside strong revenue growth. These measures will help us achieve profitability in the defined time frame of March 2023,” said Mrinal Mohit, chief executive of Byjus India business, in a statement. Todays startup layoffs have nothing on the 2020 correction Byju’s founder Byju Raveendran told TechCrunch in an interview last month that he doesnt think the startup will file for an IPO in the next 12 months. He also said the startup is in talks to close a new funding round from sovereign funds in the coming weeks. At a group level, Byjus will continue to hire across all levels and will end this financial year as a net hirer. Byjus plans to hire a total of 10,000 more teachers in the coming year, adding to its current strength of 20,000 teachers. To fuel its growth, the company is expanding its teams along with hiring senior leadership to further build operational strength, the company said in a statement.",

        "Extracted Article": "Noom, a health coaching platform valued at $3.7 billion last year, is laying off a portion of staff for the second time in a matter of months, TechCrunch has learned from sources. Noom has laid off 10% of its staff, or around 500 people, which is a reduction that mostly impacts its coaching team. It’s the second layoff impacting Noom’s coaching team in a matter of months, impacting hundreds of employees. Sources say that Noom has nearly halved its number of coaches since the beginning of the year, which looks to currently be around 1,000 coaches. Noom has experienced extraordinary growth over the past several years, and it’s essential that we are structured in a way that enables us to continue growing over the long term, a Noom spokesperson said over e-mail. We recently made the difficult decision to reduce the number of Noom employees. We are deeply grateful for their contributions to Noom, and we wish them continued success. Noom declined to answer questions regarding scale of layoffs, separation packages and strategy beyond this statement. The startup, which has raised over $650 million in funding since launching in 2008, is partially known for its controversial approach to weight loss and dieting. Now, however, it’s showing tensions from a personnel front. Noom’s scaleback of its coaching services suggests a departure from the platform’s original pitch, which was to combine intelligent nutrition with exercise coaching. In 2020, Noom hit $400 million in revenue using this strategy. One year later, Noom expanded its coaching services by launching a mental health vertical. Its current website shows a glimpse of how Noom thinks, or at least thought, about coaching as its strategy. “Welcome to the Noomily,” Noom’s website reads. “Our coaches guide users through the ups and downs of the weight loss journey with empathy and compassion. They help users better understand themselves through personalized action plans that are based on their individual goals, preferences, and lifestyle.” The landing page for coaches goes on to explain the daily life of a Noom coach, which ranges from helping clients develop “a healthy lifestyle” and “contribute to the growth of something amazing.” Coaches are able to enroll in health plans after 90 days of employment, the website said. Now, however, that advertising has a different tone. The company is reportedly moving more to scheduled video calling instead of live chat. According to a memo obtained by TechCrunch, Noom co-founders Artem Petakov and Saeju Jeong addressed the layoffs to employees and said that it was critical for the company to “manage expenses, increase efficiency and be more effective about how we achieve our mission” despite “significantly improving” company financials. “Today’s decisions put us in a position where we can continue to place big bets for the next year, and innovate and grow in the years ahead,” the co-founders wrote in the internal memo. Today’s layoff comes right as the company’s CFO, Mike Noonan, leaves to join TripAdvisor, The Wall Street Journal reports. A Noom spokesperson said over e-mail that the layoffs and CFO departure are two separate, unrelated announcements. In the internal memo, the co-founders went on to say that the startups big bet is focused on creating a more comprehensive mind and body platform with a higher degree of personalization. The co-founders nodded to their enterprise offering as “another bet that has the potential to dramatically expand our customer base.” “Finally, over the next few days, we may see unkind headlines, but ask that you maintain focus on whats most important now: caring for our departing colleagues like family, by treating them with humanity and respect,” the co-founders wrote. The company was last known to be reportedly planning for a 2022 IPO, at a $10 billion valuation.

        "Extracted Article": "Corporate spend management startup Brex has laid off 136 people, or 11% of its staff, across all departments as part of a restructuring, the company has told TechCrunch exclusively. After the layoffs, Brex has just over 1,150 employees. It’s been a tumultuous year for Brex, which announced in April that it was leaning into the enterprise segment. That new focus led to the company announcing in June that it would no longer work with small businesses or non professionally funded startups. The latter news caused a bit of an uproar and some feelings of abandonment in the startup community, which Brex initially set out to serve. Internally, the move apparently left less of a need for certain internal staff who were focused on serving those SMBs. Brex said it initially tried to “repurpose” as many roles as it could before ultimately deciding it had to let some people go. The layoffs also are evidence that even decacorns are not immune to the challenging macro and fundraising environment that 2022 has brought us. It was exactly nine months ago that Brex confirmed that it had raised $300 million in a Series D-2 round at a $12.3 billion valuation. Greenoaks Capital and TCV co-led that financing, which brought the three-year-old San Francisco-based startup’s total raised to $1.2 billion. Fintech Brex confirms $12.3B valuation, snaps up Meta exec to serve as its head of product Unsurprisingly, Brex cited the challenging macro environment in its decision. In a blog post, co-founder and co-CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote: Late last year we decided to sharpen our focus and serve fewer customers really well. Today’s change is a continuation of this. We’ve been laser-focused on serving early-stage startups and scaled companies this year, and we’re very grateful for the momentum we’ve seen on Empower since we launched in April. While we’re fortunate to be in a strong financial position with many years of runway, the new macro environment is materially different from the first five years of Brex, and warrants a new level of focus and financial discipline. We know the importance that our customers place on Brex’s financial strength, and this change will put us on a path to sustainable profitability over the next few years. Over the summer, Sam Blond left his role as chief revenue officer at Brex to become an investor at Founders Fund. His replacement, Doug Adamic, had over 16 years experience at SAP/Concur most recently as that companys chief revenue officer and is helping drive enterprise sales, according to the company. More recently, sources told TechCrunch that Adam Swiecicki is stepping down from his role as chief financial officer at Brex, a position he assumed late last year when Michael Tannenbaum took on the position of chief operating officer. He will be joining workforce platform Rippling, which recently entered the spend management space, as CFO. Brex confirmed Swiecickis impending move, with co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras telling TechCrunch: Were happy for Adam in his next role and its always great to see our team land with great companies. Rippling is a Brex partner and is focused on the small business market, while Brex has moved upmarket. From our side, Michael Tannenbaum will resume the role of CFO. Moving forward, Tannenbaum who began serving as CFO initially in 2017 will serve in both positions. Swiecicki’s decision to leave is reportedly unrelated to the layoff. In an attempt to soften the blow for the laid-off workers, Brex said the affected employees will receive eight weeks of pay, with an additional two weeks for each complete year of service. For those with less than one year at the company, the startup said it is waiving the equity cliff. And for those with options, it is offering to extend the exercise period to seven years. Impacted workers will have access to current healthcare benefits through the end of the month, and then Brex says it will pay for six months of health insurance. The company says it is also dedicating part of its recruiting team to help those impacted “find new opportunities,” and will prioritize hiring them back “as roles open up over time.” Additionally, Brex is letting all impacted employees keep their computers. Brex started its life focused on providing credit cards aimed mainly at startups and SMBs. It gradually evolved its model with the aim of serving as a one-stop finance shop for these companies before its aforementioned pivot to a focus on enterprise earlier this year. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company is “getting some really strong signals on Empower, its new enterprise-focused software offering. Since Empowers April launch, its monthly active user count has grown 5x month-over-month “on an increasingly large base, the spokesperson added. It also, the company said, passed $3 billion in annualized processing volume in less than three months of the platform going live. Meanwhile, the spokesperson told TechCrunch that Brex cash deposits are up 100% year over year, noting that rising interest rates have actually increased the revenue in its deposits business. Brex declined to share hard revenue figures, saying only that “growth even in this environment is remaining quite strong.” The company obviously took a big chance by betting on the enterprise space.

Spotify will also reassign some staff to other podcasts, we understand. Reached for comment, Spotify said it does not comment publicly on staffing changes. Over the next couple of months, podcasts leaving the platform include Gimlets “How to Save a Planet,” “Crime Show,” “Every Little Thing,” as well as Parcasts “Medical Murders,” “Female Criminals,” “Crimes of Passion,” “Dictator,” “Mythology,” “Haunted Places” and “Urban Legends.” In the second quarter of 2023, Spotify will also say goodbye to “Horoscope Today.” In an internal note, chief content officer of Spotify, Dawn Ostroff, and Julie McNamara, head of U.S. studios and video, wrote that Nicole Beemsterboer will become Gimlet’s new managing director, the source familiar with the matter shared. Liliana Kim has been brought on as the new managing director of Parcast. This is the first time Spotify has made a group cancellation of podcasts. The move was likely made to help strengthen its slate of original and exclusive (O&amp;E) podcasts, which include hit shows “Batman Unburied,” “Call Her Daddy” and the newly released Kim Kardashian’s “The System: The Case of Kevin Keith.” Similar to cancellations in the TV industry, Spotify appears to be weeding out the duds. This could make room for the several upcoming O&amp;E (original and exclusive) titles that the company intends to announce in the weeks and months ahead, we hear. Overall, the music streaming platform has a total of 500+ O&amp;E podcasts produced across its four in-house studios, Spotify Studios, The Ringer, Parcast and Gimlet. The cancellations didn’t impact Spotify Studios and The Ringer. Last month, Spotify launched over 300,000 audiobooks, a new feature that puts the company in direct competition with top audiobook providers Audible, Audiobooks, Google and Nook, among others.

        "Extracted Article": "Spin, which was acquired by Tier Mobility earlier this year, has laid off about 10% of its staff — including a number of executives — and is exiting Canada and Seattle, TechCrunch has learned. The micromobility company informed its workforce of more than 700 during a Friday all-hands meeting that lower-than-expected demand in the U.S. amid the waning pandemic, along with economic conditions such as rising inflation and a tightening VC funding environment, led to the decision. About 78 people, the majority of whom are white-collar workers based in its San Francisco headquarters, have been laid off. The affected employees were notified prior to the meeting. Staff was also told that it is exiting Kelowna, British Columbia, and Seattle, where it was just invited to return as a bikeshare vendor for 2023. Seattles Department of Transportation told TechCrunch that Spin, which operated a scootershare in Seattle from 2021 to 2022, was not granted a permit to continue scooter operations in 2023; the DOT said it was working with Spin to confirm their plans in light of the recent announcement. Spin had operations in Edmonton, Red Deer and St. Albert, Canada, but never reactivated those cities after winter ended this year. Kelowna was its last remaining Canadian market. Philip Reinckens, a Tier veteran who took the CEO spot in May, delivered the news to employees, according to sources who asked not to be named. During the 20-minute meeting, Reinckens told workers that the companys priorities are to preserve cash and achieve profitability. Notably, he said the entire micromobility industry was suffering from a perfect storm of events that included supply chain constraints, inflation, the war in Ukraine and a tight labor market. While the company has cut costs such as downsizing its San Francisco office and rolled out programs to encourage more ridership and raise its bottom line, the company still wasnt able to capture the demand needed to make profit and loss figures work, he said, according to an audio recording of the event shared with TechCrunch. Lucas Beard, Spins VP of growth and marketing, also confirmed the layoffs and the decision to leave Canada. While it’s impossible for us to predict the future in such a new industry, what we can promise is that we’ll continue to be as transparent and thoughtful as possible as we continue to evaluate our financial performance and external market conditions, Beard wrote in an email. He added that Spin is also centralizing some areas with parent company Tier. The layoffs come about six months after Berlin-based micromobility operator Tier Mobility acquired Spin from automaker Ford. The acquisition marked Tiers move into North America and came after an aggressive expansion in Europe that included buying e-scooter company Wind Mobility’s Italian subsidiary and bike-share startup Nextbike. The Spin acquisition gave Tier a global footprint of more than 520 cities and communities in 21 countries. It also added to its costs and ultimately led Tier to restructure. In August, Tier laid off about 16% of its workforce, or 180 people, due to economic conditions and a tightening funding climate. The VC firms once gladly forked over funds to shared micromobility startups even as costs piled up and questions loomed about whether shared scooters and e-bikes could ever be profitable enterprises. In the past year, micromobility companies still reliant on external funding have found a less receptive VC community. Bird, Superpedestrian and Voi are a few that have laid off workers in 2022. The lack of demand in some markets — including ones that once were teeming with users before the COVID pandemic — has forced companies to restructure their businesses and seek ways to cut costs. Clarification: This article has been been update to reflect the nature of Spins relationship with Seattle. The company was not granted a permit to continue its scootershare in the city in 2023, but was granted to operate a bikeshare. Micromobility is fun, but perhaps that’s all it’ll ever be",

        "Extracted Article": "Truepill, a platform that helps other companies offer diagnostics, telehealth services and prescriptions, has conducted its fourth layoff of the year. Sources say the layoff impacted around 65% of the existing staff across the engineering, human resources, design, IT and finance teams. The layoff comes around two months after its last round, which sources say impacted about a third of the company, or 175 people. Update 10/06/22: After publication of this story, Truepill chief growth officer, Doreen Bortel, reached out with a series of corrections regarding the layoff figures. First, Bortel said that the fourth round of layoff impacted 20% of staff, a figure that only counts full-time, regular employees across all departments including vice presidents and above. The third round, Bortel says, impacted 8% of the then-headcount, not 33%. Neither figure includes contractors. One employee, who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity, said that they were told that their position was “no longer sustainable due to economic factors” on a 1:1 call with leadership. Severance was mentioned but HR has not yet reached out to the employee with further details. “[The company said] it hoped there wasn’t going to be any layoffs after the August round,” the source said. “[Leadership said that] investors made some requests in order for the company to extend the financial runway so they made tough choices, but that we were now on good footing.” A company-wide all hands, previously scheduled for this week, has been bumped to next week, the source added. A troubling startup layoff trend has emerged In April, Truepill halted prescriptions to ADHD medications because of growing concerns about digital health. The disruption in service impacted employees within Truepill’s recently acquired adult ADHD treatment company, Ahead. Reports say that Truepill was the preferred pharmacy partner of Cerebral, which is under federal investigation amid claims that employees felt pressure to prescribe drugs to customers. In June, Sid Viswanathan confirmed that he laid off an additional 15% of staff, impacting 150 people. Viswanathan said in a letter that the company was “focused on defining a new category in healthcare and growing top-line revenue,” but what was essential is the company operates “with a new level of financial discipline and prioritization, ensuring the longevity of Truepill for both our clients and our teams.” In August, Truepill’s entire U.K. team was laid off, as well as a meaningful portion of the virtual pharmacy platform’s product team, sources told TechCrunch. The data team was also impacted, while the diagnostics and telehealth components of the company — its core services — will be only lightly supported going forward. Truepill says these services have always been ancillary to the business. Today’s layoff impacts a number of teams, including the support engineering team that was tasked in picking up the U.K. team’s work after they were let go.

In a message to staff, CEO Jeff Lawson called the layoffs wise and necessary, blaming them partially on Twilios rapid growth over the last several years and [lack of focus] on key priorities. I take responsibility for those decisions, as well as the difficult decision to do this layoff, Lawson wrote in a letter sent internally and published to Twilios blog. Twilio has always been a growth company. And as you know, were committed to being a profitable growth company. At our scale, being profitable will make us stronger We ultimately found that some investments no longer make sense and identified areas where we can be more efficient. According to Lawson, the cuts will mostly impact areas of go-to-market, R&amp;D and Twilios general and administrative departments. Employees affected who were notified this morning will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, as well as one week for every year of service at Twilio, in addition to the value of Twilios next stock vest. Lawson says Twilios talent acquisition team will create a list that laid-off employees can opt into, to be shared with other companies that may be hiring and investors who know many such companies. Paperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the headcount reduction will cost between $70 million to $90 million, by Twilios estimates, with the bulk of costs being incurred during the companys third and fourth fiscal quarters 2022. Todays layoffs are about aligning our investments more squarely with our priorities, as well as running our company more efficiently overall, Lawson continued. No doubt, it will be a hard few months as we change the shape of our company for the opportunity ahead. As CNBC notes, publicly traded, San Francisco-based Twilio has been striving for profitability in 2023. The company nearly doubled headcount during the pandemic as the appetite for its cloud services climbed. In 2021, Twilio acquired data security platform Ionic Security and toll-free messaging services provider Zipwhip the latter for $850 million. But sales cratered as the world returned to in-person work. Twilios Q2 2022 sales growth was 41%, the lowest since the December quarter in 2017, as the company faced a cyberattack that compromised the data of more than 100 customers. In its most recent fiscal quarter (Q2), Twilio while exceeding Wall Streets expectations reported a loss of $322.8 million on $943.4 million in revenue. Shares were up about 1% on news of the layoffs; Twilios stock has fallen about 73% this year.",

        "Extracted Article": "Last September, Egyptian startup Capiter raised $33 million in Series A funding to compete in the country’s growing B2B e-commerce and retail space. Fast-forward a year later, the startup has laid off multiple employees and now its CEO and COO have been relieved from their duties after allegedly mismanaging funds. Here’s what we know so far. Between June to July, several ex-employees of Egyptian startups, including Capiter, wrote posts about layoffs at their respective companies even though the employers never addressed them publicly. Other companies include OPay Egypt, elmenus, ExpandCart and Brimore. Some sources told TechCrunch that Capiter had laid off at least 100 staff in those two months. Others described a workplace with poor management and no structure and a company finding it hard to onboard merchants to its platform while running out of money simultaneously. The company had only a month runway as of August, they said. TechCrunch reached out to Capiter at the time but received no response. As a result, Capiter investors have been searching for potential buyers to absorb the struggling company in the form of an acquisition or merger. This information was further corroborated in a local news report where Capiter’s Board allegedly said that the founders had not been reporting to the board, its representatives and shareholders during on-site in-person due diligence for a potential merger. Another publication stated the executives had refrained from appearing before the board of directors after internal disturbances and disagreements over their management method. Before Capiter, Mahmoud was the co-founder and COO of Egypt-born and Dubai-based ride-hailing company SWVL (the company, which went public via a SPAC deal last year, laid off 32% of its staff this May). With his brother Ahmed, he launched Capiter in 2020 as an FMCG platform that allows small and medium-sized retailers to order inventory, arrange delivery and access financing to pay for goods. Some of its competitors include MaxAB and Cartona in Egypt, and in Africa, Wasoko, TradeDepot and Chari. Capiter had 50,000 merchants and 1,000 sellers with more than 6,000 SKUs on its platform when the founders spoke to TechCrunch last September. In the interview, they said Capiter was on its way to reaching an annualized revenue of $1 billion this year. And like many startups in Africa and globally, Capiter hired aggressively last year to meet its targets. However, 2022 has taken an unexpected turn for many tech startups as they deal with uncertainty arising from increasing interest rates and other factors that have a trickle-down effect on venture capital. News of layoffs, flat rounds and cutbacks from startups in various sectors — especially those that raised a lot of money within the past 18-24 months, such as Wave, 54gene, Kuda, and Marketforce — have been more widespread despite the continent boasting a better VC total by the end of Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021. Egyptian startup Capiter raises $33M to expand B2B e-commerce platform across MENA B2B e-commerce platforms operate either asset-light or inventory-heavy models. The latter requires more capital and for Capiter, which employs a hybrid model, it’s unclear how the company has exhausted its funds and is already looking to sell after raising millions from Quona Capital, MSA Capital, Shorooq Partners, Savola and others last year. Capiter’s investors declined to comment on the matter but issued an email statement. “The Board and shareholders have initiated an internal investigation and therefore are not at liberty to comment on the news or allegations circulating the social media for the time being. The Board and shareholders are also working closely with relevant stakeholders, legal and HR teams as well as the legal authorities for an external investigation on this matter.” Meanwhile, according to local reports, the company’s chief financial officer Majid El Ghazouli will act as interim CEO. Mahmoud didn’t respond to comment. Update: Headline changed to reflect founders’ charge. Also, CEO Mahmoud Nouh, in response to the allegations, said, “I deny the false allegations and that I haven’t received any official notice of what’s above [referencing the statement about his and Ahmed’s dismissal].” BharatPe founder Ashneer Grover siphoned off money, Indian startup says",

The news of the layoffs, which was first disclosed to TechCrunch by sources, was confirmed by Kuda via email, saying it laid off less than 5% of its 450-strong workforce, or about 23 people. The company’s numbers are small compared to other layoffs that have taken place within Africa’s tech ecosystem over the past few months, especially among startups that have raised vast sums of venture capital within the last year or two; for instance, Swvl laid off 400; Wave, approximately 300; 54gene, 95; and Vezeeta, 50. However, the event speaks to varied efforts startups — including soonicorns and unicorns — are making. It’s not entirely a surprise, in Kuda’s case, even though the company went on a hiring spree for designers in July. When Kuda held a town hall meeting last month, cutting down seemingly redundant roles and dismissing nonperforming staff to reduce costs and extending runway were topics of conversation in light of current macroeconomic trends, according to sources. Meanwhile, it was just last August that the digital bank, which provides zero to minimal fees on cards, account maintenance and transfers and is one of Africa’s soonicorns, raised $55 million — money that it planned to use to not only double down on new services for Nigeria but also to prepare its launch into more countries on the continent like Ghana and Uganda — in a Series B round that saw it valued at $500 million. The company, having raised more than $90 million in total from investors such as Valar Ventures and Target Global, is also planning an expansion outside Africa to Pakistan. It recently hired Pavel Khristolubov, an ex-Tinkoff executive, as its global chief operating officer and Elena Lavezzi, a former Revolut executive in Europe, as chief strategy officer to oversee efforts in this regard and also grow its over 4 million customer base. Kuda, the African challenger bank, raises $55M at a $500M valuation As Kuda positions itself for pan-African and international expansion amidst an uncertain venture capital environment, it depicts the recent cut in its workforce as part of strategic steps for sustainable growth. “Kuda is currently making some strategic changes to serve its customers better and continue to make financial services more accessible, affordable and rewarding to every African,” said the four-year-old company, citing reasons for the layoffs. Kuda said in the email that affected staff cuts were made across various departments in the company. Per sources, this includes growth, marketing and product departments. African genomics startup 54gene lays off 95 as COVID testing business struggles Wave, a Stripe-backed African fintech valued at $1.7 billion, cut 15% of its staff in June",

        "Extracted Article": "African genomics startup 54gene has laid off 95 employees, or about 30% of its LinkedIn-sourced 290+ employees. A companys spokesperson confirmed the news after several sources informed TechCrunch of the layoffs last week. Founded in 2019 by Dr. Abasi Ene-Obong, the three-year-old startup seeks to address the gap in the global genomics market where less than 3% of genetic material used in pharmaceutical research is African. This is despite reports saying Africans and people of African ancestry are more genetically diverse than all other world populations combined. As one of Africas most audacious projects, 54gene has received enormous backing from the likes of Y Combinator, Adjuvant Capital and Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund (CAIF) and several investors who have invested $45 million in the company, including a $25 million Series B last September; a large chunk of the companys investment goes into its biobank (which now has a capacity of over 300,000 samples) and lab testing centers. African genomics startup 54gene raises $25M to expand precision medicine capabilities In 2020, 54gene saw an opportunity to make additional revenue during the pandemic as it turned its lab capabilities and re-positioned itself to conduct COVID-19 testing, which spiked in Africa when the company closed its Series A round. It was a big part of the companys operation; at some point, 54gene was one of Nigerias largest providers of COVID testing. However, with the significant decline in tests, many 54gene employees recruited in relation to COVID operations had to be let go, the companys spokesperson told TechCrunch. Multiple business functions supporting the COVID business line, including labs and sales departments, were affected. The virtual winding down of that business line led to redundancy in these functions, alongside data entry and sample collection officers who were contract staff. Other operational and technology jobs were affected as well. Like so many others navigating this current market situation, we are not immune to having to make adjustments to headcount and our financials, in order to remain competitive within the market, said the spokesperson, adding that the company implemented the staff reduction on August 18. The companys spokesperson also stated that 54gene will provide affected employees with statutory support, in compliance with local regulations, and in some instances, the biotech startup will provide additional severance pay, as well as health insurance coverage extended for a total of three months. Layoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations. 54gene joins a growing list of African startups that have had to resize their workforce in a bear market despite raising several million dollars within the last 18-24 months. Other companies include Swvl, Vezeeta, Wave, Sendy and Marketforce. African genomics startup 54gene raises $15M led by Adjuvant Capital",

A spokesperson for the company confirmed the workforce reduction to TechCrunch, saying that it let go of 6.5% of the team, or 20 people. The figure provided by Argyle does not represent contractors that could have been impacted by the layoff. A spokesperson declined to offer further details on the number of contractors impacted, if any, or what severance was provided to employees, if any. Venture investors to founders: Turn down for what? “Argyles continued move upmarket, targeting enterprises instead of SMBs, requires a specific skill set and the company did make an adjustment to its team today,” the spokesperson wrote over email.” The same spokesperson said that the company is still on track to double its workforce by the end of the year, hiring for more than 30 open positions. While the spokesperson did not say it outright, the statement implies that it let go of people with more SMB experience and are looking to hire more enterprise-focused folks. The startup raised a $20 million Series A in October 2020, then disclosing that it processed 10 million user employment records per month. CEO and co-founder Shmulik Fishman said he wanted to disrupt the process in which institutions buy records from third parties and instead bring user consent into the mix. The goal is to give employees more ownership over their data and make the whole process more transparent. Fishman hinted at a love for Plaid in an interview that same month, even crediting the startup’s name as a nod at other successful fintechs branded around patterns. Ironically, though, Plaid has quickly gone from friend to foe. Months after Argyle landed Series A funding, Plaid announced the launch of income verification services. This year, Argyle announced a $55 million Series B funding round and the launch of a self-service tool so that consumers can access their employment records with ease. The company then claimed it has experienced “10x growth” compared to its prior round. As of last confirmed, Argyle serves over 500,000 U.S. employers, including 60% of the Fortune 500 and “close to 100% of gig workers.” In its early days, Argyle told FinLedger that its largest customer segment were companies focused on credit extension such as financial institutions, publicly traded banks, credit unions, insurance providers and any company that provides “credit extension in all shapes, forms and sizes.” Six conversations that bring nuance to techs layoff wave",

        "Extracted Article": "Digital mortgage lender Better.com is conducting its fourth round of layoffs since December 1, 2021, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. The latest cuts reportedly affect all departments. Better.com is not exactly known for its tactful approach to letting employees go. And this week, the company albeit accidentally lived up to that reputation. Sources told TechCrunch that a list containing the names of some people who would be let go in a layoff scheduled for Friday, August 26, was leaked internally on Tuesday, August 23. This reportedly led to those employees being “immediately terminated” three days early, according to a Blind post and to information provided by some of those affected workers. Better.com teaches us how not to downsize a company It is unclear at this time how many people in total will be laid off in this latest round, but one impacted worker estimated that it would be “at least 250 or more” and that they “will all be from the U.S. side.” Another source said the company seemed to be “going for higher corporate salaries.” TechCrunch reached out to Better.com regarding the layoffs, and a spokesperson provided the following statement: We’re making prudent decisions to adjust to market dynamics so that we can continue to serve our customers for the long-term. Additionally, the company is said to have rolled out a new leave of absence (LOA) policy that “dramatically” reduces the amount of leave team members are eligible for. The new policy was effective immediately, according to documents shared with TechCrunch. Those same documents indicate that for those already on paid leave, the updated policies will be effective as of October 1. A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the move was designed to protect the company and be smart about its future, adding: We’ve taken a look at our policies where were overspending and have decided to reduce areas to better align with industry standards. In less than nine months, the company has let go thousands of workers, seen numerous senior executives step down and delayed a SPAC that it recently said it was still working toward. Notably, Better.com also recently announced a spate of new executive hires that no doubt were not cheap for the company. One source told TechCrunch that the company’s “burn rate is so high, there will probably not be enough to operate past December without additional funding.” Better, along with others catering to home buyers, has been hit hard by the increased mortgage interest rates and challenging macro environment, as well as the questionable actions of its CEO and co-founder, Vishal Garg. Earlier today, real estate tech company Reali announced it was winding down operations and laying off its staff after raising $100 million a year ago.

        "Extracted Article": "Tier Mobility, the German micromobility giant that recently acquired Spin from Ford, is laying off 16% of staff, or 180 people, according to a LinkedIn post by CEO Lawrence Leuschner and an open letter from the executive that has been viewed by TechCrunch. Ultimately, we have to respond to the current economic and funding climate, reducing the number of projects and business lines we are focussing on as a company in order to accelerate our path to profitability, wrote Leuschner. Leuschner also noted that hes committed to helping those who were laid off find new roles. Tier has set up a Tier Alumni page with details of the people who are leaving to assist recruiters. While Tier has not responded to TechCrunchs requests for more information, the layoffs appear to span a variety of teams, mostly in Berlin, with the highest concentration of layoffs coming from marketing, market development and technology teams. Most employees were informed by team leaders in 1-2-1 meetings Tuesday morning, according to Leuschners letter. Tiers decision to cut staff is the latest in a string of tech startup layoffs that are particularly concentrated in late-stage companies that are finding the current economic climate a difficult one in which to raise extension rounds and grow into their valuations. Tier was previously valued at $2 billion. The transportation space has not been immune to this. In June, Bird laid off 23% of its staff, or about 140 workers, due to a dire need to tighten its belt and restructure internally. Last month Lyft let go of 2% of its staff, or about 60 employees, as it shut down its in-house car rental program. And this week Ford Motor Company said it that plans to lay off 3,000 employees as it restructures toward electrification. The news from Tier comes as the micromobility operator appeared to be on an upswing after raising $200 million in October last year and going on a startup shopping spree. Last November, Tier acquired Nextbike to double down on its commitment to offering e-bikes, as well as e-scooters. In December, the company bought Wind Mobilitys Italian unit to expand geographically. By March, Tier had acquired Fantasmo to bring the startups camera-based scooter parking validation technology in-house, as well as Spin from Ford, marking the operators entrance into the North American market and making it the largest operator in the world. All of those deals, aside from Ford, were likely primarily stock deals, meaning Tier didnt necessarily have to shell out cash for them, according to industry experts. We have moved away from the strong focus we had on rapid growth and geographic expansion that defined the first few years of the business, and towards ensuring an increased return on investment for our current footprint, wrote Leuschner in his letter to staff, noting that Tier had been transparent about three months ago with the team about the companys goals to accelerate its response to the current economic downturn and funding climate. We have also taken the decision to stop or pause specific projects and work streams that cant currently demonstrate a clear path to profitability, and we have shared these decisions with you as they have been made. Team members who were laid off will have access to severance pay, employee support in finding their next role, including help with CV, LinkedIn and cover letter writing, access to the alumni page, mental health support for three months of leaving the business and the ability to keep all office equipment and laptops for permanent employees. Tier is also offering equity and dropping its one-year cliff on ESOP for everyone hired in the past year. The company told TechCrunch that after assessing certain projects and directions that Tier would have to reduce or stop, it then looked at which roles would be unnecessary as a result of those decisions. To keep the process fair and retain as many people as possible, Tier applied a social scoring formula to determine where to make cuts. Different countries have different requirements when it comes to this but often this takes into account things like tenure, age and whether an individual has dependents, Madeline Ash, strategic communications advisor at Tier told TechCrunch via email. Once we had been through these two steps, we then also went through a process to skill match affected individuals against any open roles we have at Tier and Nextbike to see if these could be offered as an alternative to allow us to retain as many people as possible. This story has been updated to include information from the open letter sent by CEO Lawrence Leuschner, as well as further details into how Tier made its decisions on whom to lay off.",

        "Extracted Article": "Stripe has laid off some of the employees who support TaxJar, a tax compliance startup that it acquired last year, TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources and firsthand documentation. The layoffs — conducted over the last month — are related to Stripe’s decision to wind down TaxJar-focused go-to-market efforts in late July. Sources estimate the number of employees impacted by the workforce reduction is between 45 and 55 folks, at least a portion of whom were invited to take 30 days to apply to internal jobs at Stripe. TechCrunch reached out to Stripe for confirmation, and a spokesperson said the company declined to comment. According to LinkedIn, TaxJar’s co-founder Matt Anderson left Stripe in July, followed by folks in the sales, marketing and partnerships teams. Anderson did not immediately respond to request for comment Stripe bought TaxJar, a provider of a cloud-based suite of tax services, in April 2021 to help its customers “automatically calculate, report and file sales taxes.” At that time, Stripe told TechCrunch that all 200 employees of the Massachusetts-based business were joining the company. The goal of the acquisition was to integrate sales tax collection and remittance as a service, one of the most requested features among users. In July, Stripe went through a 409A valuation process that saw its internal valuation cut by 28%. The rich company is valued by investors at $95 billion, but the implied new internal share price is around $74 billion. While valuation cuts are often viewed as a negative event for a company — industry experts argued that a lower 409A valuation, which is set by a third party and is different from what venture capitalists measure — they make it cheaper for employees to exercise vested options. Stripe’s new and lower internal valuation, explained Fintech hasn’t been immune to the downturn — for evidence, you need to look no further than the stock prices of Block (formerly Square), PayPal, Robinhood and Affirm. Global fintech funding in the second quarter of 2022 fell 33% to $20.4 billion across 1,225 deals in Q2 from Q1 2022, per CB Insights, and declined nearly 46% from the $37.6 billion raised across 1,287 deals in Q2 2021. It’s a similar story looking at some players within the startup world. On Deck, a venture-backed startup accelerator that invests in other companies, recently cut 25% of staff and scaled back its accelerator program. Then, months later, it cut a third of staff. MainStreet, fresh off of layoffs itself, underwent a recapitalization from some investors. The company was just valued at $500 million last year for its platform that helps startups uncover tax credits. Also, one-click checkout startup Bolt laid off at least 180 employees and counting across go-to-market, sales and recruiting roles. That move came just a month after its closest competitor, Fast, shut down due to high burn. In the late-stage world, buy now, pay later platform Klarna laid off 10% of its workforce, and then had its valuation slashed by 85% — from $45.6 billion in July of 2021 to $6.7 billion in July of this year.

        "Extracted Article": "The United States credit system as it exists today has been around for decades and many would argue it’s long been in need of an overhaul. In the meantime, a number of startups have emerged in recent years to offer consumers more options when obtaining credit. Petal is one such company. The New York-based startup, which offers three Visa credit card products aimed at underserved consumers, has said its goal is to help people “build credit, not debt.” It does this by using cash flow underwriting to help assess applicants creditworthiness and also using credit scores when theyre available. To be clear, Petal is not itself a bank. Its cards are issued by WebBank, a member of the FDIC, but they’re Petal branded and the startup manages servicing for the cards. (TomoCredit, which TechCrunch has also covered, has a similar model of underwriting based on cash flow.) Specifically, Petal offers what it describes as “modern” Visa credit cards, along with a mobile app, designed to help people “responsibly” build credit and manage their finances. Demand for its offering has been growing, with the company having added 100,000 cardholders last year, according to CEO and co-founder Jason Rosen. At the time of Petal’s Series D raise in January of 2022, the company said it had 300,000 cardholders, and that it was “doing $20 million to $30 million in annualized revenue.” By year’s end, it was up to $80 million, and Rosen is projecting that Petal will become profitable sometime in 2024. A majority of consumers approved for Petal credit cards since its 2018 launch had either thin or no credit history when they were first approved, according to Rosen. Members who joined with no prior credit history have gone on to achieve an average credit score of 681 after 12 months as Petal cardholders, he said. Despite rising inflation and a challenging macro environment, Rosen claims Petal is not seeing rising delinquency or default rates this year, Rosen added. In fact, the delinquency rates for Pedal have actually been improving this year so far. And today, the company is announcing it has raised an additional $35 million in what Rosen is describing as “strategic financing.” Part of that money will go toward spinning out the Prism Data unit of its business into an independent company. Rosen will serve as CEO of that new entity as well, which has about 10 employees, while Petal has about 140. Petal makes money in a few ways: from interchange fees; from interest if/when people carry a balance and from fees on certain cards. Its Rise card, which launched late last year, includes a $59 membership fee. The company did conduct a layoff, which affected about 10% of its team, in the third quarter as part of a restructuring, Rosen said. Prism Data essentially takes the cash flow underwriting technology the company initially developed for use at Petal, and makes it available to any lender, fintech or financial institution. Petal established Prism Data in 2021 with the goal of helping other businesses “benefit from cash flow underwriting,” Rosen said. “We believed that cash flow underwriting had the potential to change the way consumer finance works across the board — not only in credit cards, but everywhere that creditworthiness is evaluated, from personal and Buy-Now-Pay-Later loans to auto loans, mortgages and more, offered by anyone from the biggest banks to the smallest fintechs,” he said. Prism, Rosen added, took the cash flow underwriting technology initially created by Petal, combined it with “a lot more data” and developed it into a set of new products dubbed CashScore v3 that was announced late last year. The model, according to Rosen, was built using millions of anonymized, consumer-permissioned records from a variety of different credit providers, credit products and customer segments. Said Rosen: “Prism’s open banking products add material predictive power beyond traditional credit scoring models by surfacing hidden obligations like rent, BNPL usage and payday loans…We think that Prism can become a really common infrastructure that everybody uses when incorporating open banking data into their decision-making.” Valar Ventures tripled down on the company by leading the new investment. It was joined by Story Ventures (which was a small investor in Petal’s seed round), Core Innovation Capital, RiverPark Ventures and others. Notably, Synchrony Bank and Samsung Next also participated in the financing as strategic investors. Petal declined to reveal its new valuation or comment on whether the round was a flat, up or down one. It was valued at about $800 million at the time of its last round in January of 2022 and has raised nearly $300 million in equity capital and more than $450 million in debt financing since its 2016 inception. Trish Mosconi, executive vice president and chief strategy corporate development officer at Synchrony, said in a statement that the bank has a “deep history of using data to make informed lending decisions and create faster, seamless personalized customer experiences.” She added: “The Prism Data platform is innovative in providing differentiated consumer insights, enabling financial institutions to make more data-driven decisions. We look forward to exploring partnerships with Petal and Prism Data to help improve access to credit.” Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity giant Malwarebytes has laid off 125 employees, or about 14% of its global workforce. News of the layoffs began circulating on LinkedIn last week, with former employees sharing that they had been let go during big layoffs at the company. Marcin Kleczynski, who founded Malwarebytes back in 2008, confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch. One former Malwarebytes employee, who asked not to be named, told TechCrunch that it was communicated internally that 160 employees were to be laid off and that all departments within the business were affected. Employees were informed about the layoffs in individual Zoom meetings, during which they were told it was their last day at the company. According to one online layoffs tracker, most of the layoffs were made in the San Francisco area. Malwarebytes also has offices in Florida, Estonia, Italy and Ireland. Kleczynski told TechCrunch that the move to lay off some employees was more of a strategic reorganization than a reaction to market conditions. “Unlike most tech companies, we generate positive cash flow to grow our business,” he said. “In recent months, we have increasingly refocused our business on SMB and midmarket customer segments in alignment with our mission to protect the underserved. “We are shifting our go-to-market strategy to prioritize growing in these markets, including expanding our channel partnerships and accelerating our momentum with managed service providers (MSPs). Unfortunately, this has meant revisiting our current enterprise sales function and recalibrating the sales organization.” Malwarebytes, which started life when Kleczynski was still a student, helps to protect millions of consumers and tens of thousands of businesses to protect against and remediate malware, ransomware and zero-day exploits. The company has raised a total of $80 million in funding to date, including a $50 million Series B investment from Fidelity, which valued the company at $625 million. The security giant isn’t the only cyber startup to face layoffs in recent months. IronNet, a Virginia-based network security company, announced plans to let go of 55 workers, or 17% of its workforce, in June, while Lacework, a San Jose-based cloud security provider, laid off about 20% of its workforce of about 1,000 employees the previous month. While difficult, these changes reflect a careful realignment of our business moving forward to meet the needs of our customers and will enable the organization’s long-term growth, Kleczynski added. The cybersecurity funding bubble hasn’t burst but it’s starting to deflate",

        "Extracted Article": "Truepill, a platform that helps other companies offer diagnostics, telehealth services and prescriptions, has conducted its third mass layoff in a string of workforce reductions, sources tell TechCrunch. The layoff impacted about third of the company, or 175 people. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One source says that Truepill’s entire U.K. team was laid off, as well as a meaningful portion of the virtual pharmacy platform’s product team. The data team was also impacted, while the diagnostics and telehealth components of the company its core services will be only lightly supported going forward. Impacted employees were told that they lost their jobs via a Zoom call, and some were told that severance details would be shared in the next few days. Truepill’s next chapter will be the pharmacy operations portion of the business, a return to form after Truepill’s frantic COVID-19 product sprint. When Truepill first launched, it described itself as the AWS for pharmacies, powering companies like Hims, Nurx, LemonAID and other direct-to-consumer healthcare brands. Over time and various financing rounds Truepill saw opportunity in selling diagnostics and telehealth services. Eventually, it expanded beyond brands that serve directly to consumers and aimed at institutions such as healthcare plans, life science companies and providers. Today’s move is in stark contrast to how Truepill characterized its business just months prior; then it appeared to be in a position of offense, the company claimed to be bringing in $300 million in revenue in 2021. In an all-hands with those who remain employed at the company, sources say chief executive and co-founder Sid Viswanathan spoke about the digital health company’s need to raise a Series E round, or an extension of its Series D round, a $142 million tranche closed in October 2021. As part of that financing, Truepill was valued at $1.6 billion, officially entering into unicorn territory. In April, Truepill halted prescriptions to ADHD medications because of growing concerns about digital health. The disruption in service impacted employees within Truepill’s recently acquired adult ADHD treatment company, Ahead. Reports say that Truepill was the preferred pharmacy partner of Cerebral, which is under federal investigation amid claims that employees felt pressure to prescribe drugs to customers. In June, Viswanathan confirmed that he laid off an additional 15% of staff, impacting 150 people. Viswanathan said in a letter that the company was “focused on defining a new category in healthcare and growing top-line revenue,” but what was essential is the company operates “with a new level of financial discipline and prioritization, ensuring the longevity of Truepill for both our clients and our teams.” With today’s layoffs, the company is focused on boosting morale of the remaining staff. Per sources, Truepill will now conduct merit surveys for all employees to make sure everyone is being paid adequately. Additionally, remaining employees will also get two mental health days. Viswanathan told staff he will send executives to meet employees in-person in small groups. Just weeks prior to Truepill’s layoffs, the company announced the hire of Paul Greenall as chief business officer, the first person to take on that position since launch. In April, Truepill hired its first CFO, Ana Schrank. Meanwhile, resources remain in flux for impacted Truepill employees. A Slack group of former Truepill employees shows that those impacted by prior layoffs are struggling to get clarity on severance payments and land access to healthcare coverage.

        "Extracted Article": "Weeks after laying off workers, supply chain startup FourKites has raised $30 million as part of an ongoing financing round, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing indicates that FourKites hopes to close the round with $80 million in capital, a substantially smaller amount than the companys previous round, which landed at around $100 million. FourKites initially didnt respond to repeated requests for comment, but reached out late Friday to clarify that the investment was in part from FedEx as part of a strategic partnership announced in June. FourKites, whose customers at one time included Coca-Cola, AB InBev and Walmart, tracks and helps manage freight shipments across road, rail, ocean, air and parcel. In an interview last year, CEO Matt Elenjickal told me that the idea for FourKites evolved from his time as a supply chain consultant, where he worked with enterprises that often struggled with the need for basic supply chain visibility. FourKites is by most appearances successful, having grown its network to over 450,000 couriers and hundreds of corporate clients. But it hasnt been smooth sailing lately. In early August, FreightWaves reported that FourKites would lay off workers and sunset Haven, its ocean shipping document management and tracking solution, by the end of this year. FourKites had acquired Haven in April 2021 to integrate the startups document management capabilities into a new product called Dynamic Ocean. But in an internal email, Elenjickal said that Havens software modules had proven to be highly unprofitable The real value in acquisitions comes in having one singular global platform for all providers and all data. If you don’t integrate those systems, you wind up with a bunch of siloed platforms that don’t deliver much value for the customer, Elenjickal told FreightWaves. The real value for our customers comes from having one cohesive, user-friendly solution, so we’re very strategic about how we acquire and integrate. As is industry best practice, we sunset old acquired platforms after that integration is successful. FourKites let go nearly 8% of its workforce as part of the aforementioned layoffs, or about 60 employees in total. Most were concentrated in platforms that FourKites had acquired over the past two years but has now built into its platform, Elenjickal told JOC.com in an interview this month, including yard management solution TrackX. Elenjickal blamed economic factors like inflation, raising interest rates and unpredictable energy prices. Up until this year, it was growth at any cost, he told JOC.com. The valuation was growth divided by the interest rate. Now it’s about the path to profitability. Not immediately, but we see this lasting 18 to 24 months, and so let’s make we’re shored up on the balance sheet. The supply chain industry has taken a hit in recent months as the economic situation shows no signs of turning around. FourKites rivals Sendy and Project44 let go of a portion of their workforces this summer, as did well-capitalized supply chain and logistics vendors including Stord, Convoy, Slync.io and FarEye. Its a reversal of fortunes for a segment once seemingly immune to the macroeconomic headwinds. Just last year, funding for venture-backed supply chain management companies reached an all-time high of $11.3 billion, according to Crunchbase.",

        "Extracted Article": "Kenyan retail B2B and end-to-end distribution platform Marketforce laid off a chunk of its workforce in July, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email sent from Marketforce CEO Tesh Mbaabu and obtained by TechCrunch, the layoffs were a part of a reorganization strategy in Kenya, one of its five markets which include Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. Mbaabu confirmed the news on a call with TechCrunch, adding that the company let go of 54 people. Marketforce had more than 600 employees before the event last month, so about 9% of its overall workforce was affected, mainly from field sales, supply chain and customer experience departments. Some of these roles were instrumental to Marketforce’s growth over the past year as the company concentrated its efforts on onboarding thousands of merchants to its RejaReja platform. However, they had become redundant now that the company wants to drive more revenue per merchant, said the CEO. “We were at the phase where we were focused on growth, but we’ve gotten to a point where we’re optimizing towards profitability,” he added. This February, Marketforce raised a $40 million Series A in debt and equity (equally shared across the board) from V8 Capital Partners, Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, VU Venture Partners, Vastly Valuable Ventures and Uncovered Fund. Mbaabu founded the company with Mesongo Sibuti in 2018 as a SaaS platform for retail distribution. Two years later, the company launched RejaReja, its asset-light merchant super app and marketplace that informal traders can use to source goods directly from manufacturers and distributors, make and pay for orders digitally and accept payments for utility bills. Since its launch, RejaReja has grown exponentially, with more than 87,000 orders made through the platform at an average basket value of $151. With a 40% month-on-month growth, it expected to record over $60 million in annualized transaction volumes at the end of last year, the company told TechCrunch this February. Theres been progress on these fronts: the platform has recorded over 450,000 orders, recorded $200 million+ in annualized transaction volumes and experienced a 20% month-on-month growth this year. Some of its competitors include players such as Wasoko, TradeDepot and Omnibiz. Last year, the four-year-old company said it would introduce buy now, pay later (BNPL) options to help merchants access fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) on credit. Marketforce also highlighted expansion into more markets across East and West Africa; however, those plans might be on hold for the time being following this restructuring move in Kenya. Sources also implied that Marketforce might be struggling with its business as suppliers have begun pulling out. Mbaabu brushed the claims aside by saying, “as part of optimizing for sustainability, we are driving more consignment-based operations and optimizing for high-margin SKUs, meaning less suppliers overall.” MarketForce raises $40 million Series A, introduces BNPL merchant stock financing Mbaabu, in the email, reassured employees that the company still has enough arsenal in its coffers and attributed the company’s decision to “adapting to the global economic uncertainties” and “optimizing the business for different growth metrics.” Some roles in the Kenya market will become redundant, and new ones will emerge; all our other markets will not be impacted, he said. According to the CEO, Marketforce has commenced hires in Tanzania to scale its RejaReja product; before now, businesses in the country only had access to the SaaS platform. To employees impacted by the reorganization, Marketforce said it will: Offer you counseling services on navigating change and managing anxiety during uncertain times. Offer a training session on revamping your CV, optimizing your LinkedIn profile and interview preparation techniques. Partner with recruiters who will consider you for opportunities within other organizations that are looking to hire. Offer a certificate of service and letter of recommendation as appropriate. Pay you in lieu of notice in addition to a severance package of 15 days for every completed year of service and unutilised leave days. “To be clear, it is a path to profitability conversation. I think for a lot of people, even internally, it was hard for them to understand why we’ve raised money and have cash but still conduct layoffs,” the chief executive commented on how employees took the news. “But any additional month spent with redundant staff means cutting your runway short. And so, I think that at the end of the day, you need to think about how you conduct layoffs in a humane way. But also ensure that the company’s best interest is at heart.” Layoffs from the African tech scene have been few compared to the rest of the world. Last week, news of Kenyan logistics platform Sendy laying off employees made the rounds, adding to earlier reports from Swvl, Vezeeta and Wave. This, and the fact that funding data shows the African ecosystem has already seen inflows of around $3 billion in the first half of this year, way more than what the continent raised by this time last year, has compelled many onlookers to express optimism about the region’s chances of coming out of this bear run unscathed. But while the African tech scene has emerged as one of the most popular tech markets in the world, bustling with opportunities, it might begin to witness a rapidly changing landscape, particularly in the second half of this year as more startups raise bridge rounds, trim staff size and accept lesser valuations. “The moment of truth will be the end of the summer,” Max Cuvellier, co-founder of The Big Deal, told TechCrunch in a June interview. “August [and] September in particular because this is when we saw a boom last year.” Kenyas MarketForce raises $2M, plans to focus on its B2B retail marketplace RejaReja As the global venture capital market slows, Africa charts its own course",

        "Extracted Article": "Haus launched in 2019 as an answer to a generation’s craving for a more transparent alcohol brand, raising millions in venture funding from angels such as Casey Neistat, Away co-founder Jen Rubio and funds including Homebrew, Haystack Ventures, Coatue, Shrug Capital and Worklife Ventures. Haus has raised $17 million on rolling SAFE notes to date. Today, CEO and co-founder Helena Price Hambrecht tapped into the same ethos of transparency to announce that the startup’s Series A fell through and the company is in the process of closing down. In an interview with TechCrunch, Hambrecht spoke about Haus’s transition from buzzy VC-backed startup to a business currently up for sale, as-is or in parts. Haus sells a series of citrus, spice and flowery low ABV (alcohol by volume) aperitifs, meant to be an alternative to hard liquors and a little stronger than wines. Made in Sonoma, California, Haus also promised a product made of all-natural ingredients with a key differentiator: users could order it online and get Haus bottles delivered to their doorstep. A digital-friendly, healthier alternative that replaces wine memberships set up the company to have a strong social presence. Hambrecht, a Silicon Valley branding veteran, took over as sole chief executive of the company in 2021 after her co-founder and former husband Woody parted ways. This year, Haus shared it has crossed the $10 million in revenue threshold and recently announced that it would be hitting national distribution with Winebow, another milestone for the then solely direct-to-consumer business. Yet, as the pandemic spread throughout the world, the company went through a series of challenges, including supply chain issues, lack of in-person word of mouth growth and iOS changes. It was difficult to build the business that I wanted to build during the pandemic considering we were building a social product, Hambrecht said. We didnt have people gathering, we didnt have natural word of mouth. We were a purely digital growth brand during that time, great for acquisition but not good for monitoring long-term behavior. The progress came as Hambrecht struggled to raise venture capital funding, largely, she says, because venture investors are unable to back alcohol companies due to vice clauses in their LP agreements. “Diligence for an alcohol round is very different from software; with software it is 4-6 weeks, with alcohol it is months. I’ve learned over time that almost every process, from operating legally to fundraising diligence, is 100x harder for alcohol,” Hambrecht told TechCrunch. Because the company was unable to fundraise from traditional VC, it took on debt financing and began looking for private equity and strategic partners. Enter Constellation Brands, the producer and marketer of beer brands such as Corona Light, Modelo Especial and Pacifico. In 2018, the beverage company’s venture arm committed $100 million investment in women-led startups. Constellation’s dedicated fund stood out to Hambrecht because it, alongside the Winebow deal, would help expand the brand’s distribution. Hambrecht says that Constellation committed to leading the startup’s $10 million Series A, and even offered to advance the startup money as runway began to dwindle. Then, last minute, Constellation backed out of the deal without any specific reasoning other than “timing,” she says. TechCrunch reached out to a Constellation spokesperson for further comment but did not immediately hear back. “Here’s a Haus update that’s not fun to share,” Hambrecht said on Twitter on Monday morning. “Our lead investor recently declined to move forward with our Series A that we were in the process of closing. Without them, we do not have the cash to support continued operations at this time.” Now, Haus only has one month to sell and ship products. It is no longer manufacturing new products, but that may resume, it says. We were just beginning to see gathering come back, and I was looking forward to that new chapter. The co-founder said “there’s no villain” in the shutdown story, yet Constellation’s dropout shows another example of how difficult it is to be a venture-backed, direct-to-consumer company. When Haus announced its $4.5 million seed round, Hambrecht described the company as Glossier for Alcohol; fast-forward, and Glossier, too, has had its fair share of struggles. Despite the current situation, the co-founder doesn’t think that going the venture route was a mistake. “I’m grateful for the funding we did have, and what we were able to do with it. You build the company you want to see in the world and you know it is going to cost a little more upfront.” Instead, she says that if she were going to focus on becoming a more self-sufficient startup or run operations off of its cash flow she would have had to make that decision a year ago. As a result of the fallen Series A deal, Haus is currently for sale via an ABC process, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors process that is a voluntary alternative to filing a formal bankruptcy claim. At its peak last year, Haus had 30 employees; now only four work alongside Hambrecht, all as contractors for the firm. “It’s always dangerous to be low on cash. We got there, and it’s unfortunate, but I know there are many companies in this position right now,” Hambrecht says. “I have been sharing my work online for over 20 years now. Its definitely something in my DNA. If me sharing this process is helpful for another founder in a tough spot and considering their options, then it makes all of this a little more worth it.” As for what’s next for the entrepreneur, a Silicon Valley branding veteran, there’s no immediate plans to jump into a new startup. “My goal, right now, is to be as helpful as I can to make this ABC process have the best outcome possible. After that, I’m going to take some time to process the last four years; it’s been so extraordinary, as well as brutal and traumatic; I’m going to rest and process that.” https://www.instagram.com/p/ChAU5DDLA2h/",

        "Extracted Article": "Chicago-based Groupon today laid off more than 500 of its employees 15% of its 3,416-person headcount according to posts from former employees on social media. The reduction impacted workers in teams including merchant development, sales, recruiting, engineering, product and marketing. Groupon confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch after the publication of the story. Our overall business performance is not at the levels we anticipated and we are taking decisive actions to improve our trajectory, CEO Kedar Deshpande said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. The chief executive says that the layoffs, as well as a reinvestment in marketing and initiatives that drive customer purchase frequency, will set the company up to generate positive cash flow by the end of 2022. In a letter to staff, Deshpande said that Groupon is reducing its North America sales teams to focus on self-service merchant acquisition capabilities. It is also re-organizing the company to focus only on mission-critical activities and leaning on more external support. In addition, we are proposing to reduce cloud infrastructure and support functions as we wrap up cloud migrations. Groupon is also closing its Australia Goods business, more than a decade after launching there in the first place. Finally, Groupon said that it will rationalize its real estate footprint to be more in line with hybrid work. Coupon-finding Groupon has grown to have steep e-commerce competition since its founding in 2011. Rakuten and Honey, which sit on consumers browsers to scour the internet to show related deals, have grown into massive companies. All the platforms make money from affiliate fees and revenue-share partnerships, meaning the more competitors, the bigger the fight for customer acquisition. A spokesperson from Groupon said that it does not view Rakuten and Honey as competitors because the companies are more focused on physical products, while Groupon is focused on experiences and services. Still, e-commerce tailwinds have changed as consumer spending changes in reaction to the market downturn. It’s a hard time to be a growth-stage startup. Over the past few years, the number of Groupon shoppers has fallen sharply. According to Statista, 22.2 million visitors to the company’s site purchased at least one offer in Q1 2022, down from nearly 54 million in Q4 2014. The layoffs, while substantial, aren’t as large as the cuts Groupon made to its workforce in 2020. In April of that year, Groupon said it would lay off or furlough 2,800 employees as business “deteriorated” from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the restructuring, Groupon phased down its goods category as it shifted to a third-party marketplace model, which had merchants assume responsibility for fulfillment and returns. According to its jobs page, Groupon has openings for 67 roles in teams across account management, engineering, software development and more. The company is trading at $13.89 at time of publication, down 67% from its 52-week high of $41.66. Its likely no coincidence that the layoffs arrived ahead of the release of Groupons Q2 2022 financial results this afternoon. Revenue was $153.2 million in the second quarter 2022, down 42% compared with the prior year, on just 21.1 million customers making one or more purchases within the last 12 months. The company blamed the transition of its goods business to a marketplace model as well as a decline in engagement on the platform. Below is the entire memo that Groupon says Deshpande sent to staff this morning: Team, I’m writing to you with some tough news. Later today, we will publicly be announcing a plan to streamline our cost structure, which will include our proposal to remove approximately 500 positions globally. While we have discussed the need to streamline our organization as part of our strategy to transform Groupon into the destination for Local experiences and services, I recognize that saying goodbye to colleagues will hit us all harder than any words on a piece of paper ever can. We’ve done an intensive analysis of our organization and business structure, and the actions we are announcing today were not undertaken lightly. The impact will be felt primarily across our Technology organization, North America Sales and our Australian Goods business. Today’s news will be difficult to digest no matter how it’s presented, but I want to share as much as I can about why we are taking these actions. Put simply, our cost structure and our performance are not aligned. In order to position Groupon to successfully execute our turnaround plan, we have to lower our cost structure. Over the last three months the senior leadership team has been challenging our current processes and automating how we work, both with an eye toward taking costs out of the business and improving our productivity. As a result, we are announcing the following actions to: Reduce our North America sales team and continue to scale our self-service merchant acquisition capabilities. As we transition to a self-service led sales organization, we expect to be able to onboard and manage inventory and continue to drive efficiencies for our merchant partners. Put forward a proposal to re-organise and align the size of our tech organization to our business needs, by focusing our resources only on mission-critical activities and leaning more on external support. As part of this work, we will also be exploring opportunities to leverage engineering centers of excellence to increase efficiency and productivity. In addition, we are proposing to reduce cloud infrastructure and support functions as we wrap up cloud migrations. Close our Australia Goods business, which runs on a different platform than the rest of the Goods business making it too costly and complex to manage on an ongoing basis. Rationalize our real estate footprint to reflect the needs of our new hybrid work model. The vast majority of these cost actions would happen this year. Going forward, we’ll continue to look at ways to optimize, like leaning into automation and streamlining our tech platform, two areas we’ve made significant progress in over the last three months as teammates stepped up and challenged our current processes. We will also continue to review our cost structure in other areas and ensure it’s aligned with the size of our current business, while still giving us room to grow. To those impacted by today’s news For those of you whose roles are impacted today, we’re sincerely grateful for all of the contributions that you have made and want to do our best to support your success in the next steps of your career. For certain employees in International, you will be notified of our proposed changes and will enter into a consultation phase over the coming days and weeks. Where possible, we will be giving departing employees the option to keep their laptops, offer outplacement services as an additional resource, and where legally permitted, provide the opportunity to submit their information into a Groupon Talent List that we will be sharing on LinkedIn. We will be notifying affected employees directly throughout the day today, some we are asking to stay on for a period of time to assist with the transition. All impacted employees will receive information from HR regarding severance and other details on benefits to support you over the next weeks and months. Looking Ahead I joined Groupon because I truly believe that our marketplace is special: a place that helps people create core memories and forge new connections that can last a lifetime. Today, my conviction that the Groupon marketplace can become the destination for local experiences and services is as strong as ever. We are well positioned to transform our company and we are laying the foundation for growth. Together, we can create a fundamentally better experience for our customers and merchants. We’ll continue to discuss today’s actions and our transformation in the coming days: as a reminder we’ll be hosting a Global All Hands meeting this Wednesday at 9:30am CT / 3:30pm BST / 4:30pm CEST to answer any questions, which you can submit in advance via this form. In addition, your STeam leaders will also be bringing their orgs together to host short, informal town halls over the next few days. Thank you for your continued commitment to Groupon.

        "Extracted Article": "On Deck, a tech company that connects founders to each other, capital and advice, has conducted another round of layoffs just three months after laying off a quarter of its staff. Sources say that more than 100 people were impacted by the workforce reduction, accounting for half of the entire staff, while the company which confirmed the layoff to TechCrunch over e-mail said that 73 full-time employees were laid off. When asked about the discrepancy in figures, and whether more people were impacted under a different employment status such as contractors, an On Deck spokesperson said that they have no further comments. The company is providing all those leaving the company with eight weeks of severance, three months of accelerated option vesting and three months of healthcare coverage. Those interested in hiring laid off talent can request access to a list of people looking for new roles. On Deck, not to be confused with small business lender OnDeck, is a company that provides capital and network support for emerging fund managers and founders. Launched in June 2019, the company first announced a Founders Fellowship and has recently grown to offer more niche programs on specific verticals. It’s that broad focus that led to a need to scale back, based on co-founders David Booth and Erik Torenberg’s characterization of the company. “In the past two years of hyper-growth, On Deck launched communities serving over ten thousand founders and career professionals. Our team worked tirelessly to expand and cover a large surface area,” the duo wrote in a blog post addressing the layoff. “However, this broad focus also caused substantial tensions. What weve always projected as a strength — serving multiple user groups and building flywheels between them — also fractured our focus and brand.” The startup says it sunsetted several communities and the layoff impacted all levels and in all departments; although it did say that no executives were laid off, which contradicts that statement. Among the shuttered programs was a ten-week, $2,490 climate tech “fellowship” that kicked off in July. In a message to community members that was obtained by TechCrunch, Booth said the company would issue refunds for current On Deck Climate Tech participants. While we will no longer host live sessions or actively manage the program, you will still have access to the community, the co-founder added. On Deck is also spinning off its career advancement arm to “focus on growing learning communities for mid-career professionals who want to accelerate their careers.” The operation will be led by a former community director, Mindaugas Petrutis, and serve On Deck’s current Design, Engineering, Data Science, Marketing, Business Development and Sales, Chief of Staff and No Code communities. “Allowing our founder and career programs to operate under separate entities, led by people who are super passionate about these communities, will enable each team to focus on the needs of their core customers and will ultimately lead to better outcomes,” the company told TechCrunch in a statement. A spokesperson says that On Deck’s career development business “generates quite a bit of revenue” so it doesn’t need much additional capital beyond some seed funding that the company has already provided to start. The new company’s name is still in development. Put differently, after serving 10,000 founders to date, On Deck is now focused exclusively on helping early-stage founders build to scale. Its other programs, namely those focused on career professionals, will be sunset or spun off into a new company. It contrasts with the tone that Torenberg and Booth struck during its last layoff. In an email obtained by TechCrunch, the co-founders spoke to challenges around the firm’s recently launched ODX accelerator. “In 2021, we launched ODX, our accelerator. We saw an opportunity to stand up and try our hand at innovating a stagnant accelerator market. By many accounts, we succeeded in this goal,” the email reads. “Unfortunately, over the same time period, the market began shifting dramatically. A few months in, the capital and accelerator markets were materially different from where they had been when we started. These factors forced us to reflect and consider how On Deck would continue for the future, support our communities and ensure long-term sustainability.” After the publication of this story, On Deck said that it brought its accelerator program underneath its founder-focused program, ODF. On Deck still backs startups, but at what it says is much more founder-friendly terms. Accelerator startups are offered $25,000 for 1% or up to 2.5% of ownership, compared to the prior deal in which startups were offered $125,000 for 7% of the startup. While the accelerator may have needed to scale back, On Deck did tease a return to its founder-focused roots in May. The company rebooted ODF, which helps founders scale their startups through IRL and virtual programming, as well as On Deck Scale, a program for founders behind high-growth businesses to understand how to become better leaders. Sources estimated that the first round of layoffs occurred because On Deck only had nine months of runway left. The startup last raised known venture capital funding in March 2021, a $20 million Series A round led by Founders Fund. The startup did not answer whether or not it plans to raise capital soon, but did say that it is well-capitalized enough to have its runway at over three years.

        "Extracted Article": "Its been a volatile year for retail investment behemoth Robinhood. The fintech company is slashing 23% of its workforce, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed by TechCrunch. The layoff comes just three months after Robinhood cut 9% of full-time staff. At the time of its last layoffs in late April, it is believed that Robinhood had about 3,100 employees after letting go of around 300 workers. Doing the math, a 23% reduction in staff would amount to about 713 employees affected, leaving roughly 2,400 employees currently employed at the company Robinhood did not comment directly on the latest layoffs, pointing TechCrunch only to a blog post by CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev. In that post, Tenev wrote that while “employees from all functions would be impacted, the layoffs are “particularly concentrated” in the company’s operations, marketing and program management functions. In the post, Tenev took responsibility for Robinhood’s apparent over-hiring in the frenzy that was 2021. He said that the company last year staffed many of its operations functions under the assumption that the “heightened retail engagement” that was taking place would continue in 2022. “In this new environment, we are operating with more staffing than appropriate,” he wrote. “As CEO, I approved and took responsibility for our ambitious staffing trajectory — this is on me.” Tenev also addressed that its earlier round of layoffs “did not go far enough.” https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people/ “Since that time, we have seen additional deterioration of the macro environment with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash. This has further reduced customer trading activity and assets under custody,” he wrote. Robinhood is not alone in its choice to conduct two rounds of layoffs in a short period of time; just seven weeks after crypto exchange Gemini cut approximately 10% of its workforce, the company cut another 7% of staff, according to sources. Robinhood also today released its second quarter financials, revealing a 6% increase in net revenue of $318 million on a net loss of $295 million or 34 cents per diluted share. That loss was narrower than its net loss of $392 million, or 45 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2022. Transaction-based revenue was down 7% to $202 million while cryptocurrencies increased 7% sequentially to $58 million. Robinhood also included operating expenses associated with severance and restructuring, saying that expenses will be $17 million in connection with the April restructuring and an estimated $45 million to $60 million with the August restructuring. In 2022, total operating expenses are still expected to be down between 7% to 10% from the prior year, Robinhood claims. Robinhood’s stock price has been volatile over the past year, as well. At the time of publication, the company is trading at $8.90 after hours, dramatically lower — by 89% — than its 52-week high of $85. It’s also down 3.6% after hours. Earlier today, the WSJ wrote that Robinhood was slapped with a $30 million fine by a New York financial regulator, specifically on its cryptocurrency trading arm.

        "Extracted Article": "Months after Sendy laid off 10% of its workforce, the Kenyan logistics startup is at it again, sending more staff home while announcing the decision to wind down its Supply service and solely focus on its Fulfillment service to provide a streamlined service for its business clients. Sendy confirmed to TechCrunch that discontinuing the Supply service affected 20% of its remaining 270 staff, about 54 employees the latest casualties of the funding slowdown fueled by macroeconomic headwinds. Besides, Sendy, which has pivoted to cater to businesses only, is yet to raise the $100 million it had targeted to get this year. On a call with employees, Sendy CEO Meshack Alloys mentioned that Sendy was far off from the projections it made the previous quarter and that changes needed to be made to hit the next ones. “If we look at metrics, we’re headed in the right direction, especially our contribution margins, gross profits, take rates and EBIDTA,” said Alloys, who co-founded the startup in 2015 with Kenyans Evanson Biwott, Don Okoth and American Malaika Judd. “However, the gap between where we are today and where we’re supposed to be is still huge. To put that into context, if you look at the last three months from a GMV perspective, we’re only 65% of where we need to be. And from a revenue perspective about 44%. So the gap is quite huge. And we need to do something about it, given the tough economic conditions we’re seeing,” he declared. Kenyan logistics startup Sendy cuts 10% of its workforce Alloys, while highlighting other reasons why the company is exiting supply and doubling down on its fulfillment arm, said Sendy Fulfillment is a core product with a bigger addressable market and, unlike its Supply product, wasn’t affected by price fluctuations. “With the growing uptake of digital commerce and recognizing the opportunities it presents for businesses, we are doubling down on fulfillment to support online merchants with the necessary tools to sell and fulfill directly through digital platforms,” he said. “We understand the potential of digital commerce, therefore Sendy will now sharpen its focus and invest resources in building fulfillment and transport services for businesses.” Its Fulfillment service offers storage, packing and delivery of goods, while the now abandoned Supply service made it easy for retailers to purchase FMCGs directly from manufacturers. Some companies providing such services across Africa include Wasoko, Sabi and TradeDepot. “This move is part of our wider strategic focus to consolidate efforts around solutions that impact more customers and speak to the current and immediate market challenges,” Alloys commented. It’s been a rough few months for startups globally. In Africa, some startups have shut down, like Kune, and faced closure, like Sky.Garden. Others have laid off employees or implemented salary cuts, such as Wave, 54gene and Vezeeta. While Sendy might be the first startup to publicly announce two rounds of layoffs in Africa, it’s been a recurring theme among global startups; Robinhood, Gemini, On Deck and Hopin are a few examples.

        "Extracted Article": "Learning navigation platform Career Karma has laid off 60 people across its United States and global teams, CEO and co-founder Ruben Harris confirmed to TechCrunch. While he did not share the percentage total of those impacted, sources say a third of staff was let go. C-suite was not impacted by the workforce reduction, Harris said. The startup, founded in 2018 by Harris, Artur Meyster and Timur Meyster, links students to learning bootcamps and educational programs that fit their career and upskilling goals. The end goal of the startup is to on-ramp more folks into tech jobs, a world that we all know is under significant duress right now. According to sources, the layoff happened earlier this week and heavily impacted folks on the marketing and recruitment team. Harris confirmed that Career Karma now has over 3 years of runway to keep operating, without needing a funding round, following the layoff. “What is different about this recovery is that it will be longer,” Harris and his co-founders wrote to the board in an email sent to the company and its investors. “While the timing of our Series B fundraising has prepared us for this moment, we have to assume that this recovery will take 3 to 4 years and stretch that cash for as long as possible.” Earlier this year, Career Karma raised a $40 million Series B, led by Top Tier Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The startup has been operating since 2018 and has received checks from Y Combinator, Kapor Capital, Backstage, Emerson Collective, SoftBank and GV, formerly known as Google Ventures. Career Karma’s latest check came as the platform sought to evolve from a navigation tool for those interested in joining a bootcamp, to an employer benefit that helps workers and contractors find job training programs that fit their needs. The transition from targeting consumers to employers meant that Career Karma was serving a stickier end-customer, one that would sign up large swaths of employees versus single customers, one by one. While it makes sense from a business model and impact sense, startups are also facing dwindling budgets and need to extend runway. It means that learning and development tools may be cut from the employee benefit suite, thus impacting Career Karma’s ability to land new customers. “We are narrowing our focus to profitability of the marketplace and our enterprise expansion,” Harris wrote in an email to TechCrunch. The company considered three factors when choosing who to cut: their financial impact to the company, how critical they are to the operational infrastructure and if skills aligned with the company’s strategy. Harris added that employees impacted would have cash severance, three months of funded health, dental and vision care, and career navigation services. https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/when-do-layoffs-matter-trick-question-always/",

        "Extracted Article": "Publicly traded Lemonade has laid off about 60 employees of Metromile, the auto insurtech company it recently acquired — adding to the volatility the technology sector has seen over the past 18 months. In an emailed statement, a Lemonade spokesperson told TechCrunch that it was able to offer a role at Lemonade to about 80% of the Metromile team, but that as the deal was synergistic as it is able to operate with fewer people than were needed to staff the two standalone. Such staffing cuts are not abnormal in such business combinations, even if that is little comfort to those in eliminated roles. Metromile itself went public via a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) in February of 2021, with a valuation of over $1 billion. At the close of market on July 27, Metromile’s stock stood at $1.05, valuing the company at just under $137 million. At one time, Metromile was worth more than $20 per share. For its part, Lemonade went public via a traditional IPO in July of 2020. That company too has seen its value erode from just over $188 per share at one point to $18.40 per share, giving it a valuation of around $1.1 billion as of the time of writing. Its stock was down 7% by midday Friday and significantly lower than its 52-week-high of $91.35. Lemonade announced on July 28 that it had closed on its purchase of Metromile, noting that “In return for under $145 million in stock, Lemonade receives over $155 million in cash, over $110 million in car premiums, an insurance entity with 49 state licenses, and precision data from 500 million car trips. Where did the layoffs land? On anonymous professional network, Blind, there was chatter that Metromile’s CFO, an SVP, and “most of the product, engineering, and design teams” were let go. Lemonade did not confirm specifics around who was affected. At least one software engineer posted about the layoffs on LinkedIn. Founded in 2011, Metromile launched its personalized pay-per-mile auto insurance a year later one of the first companies to apply that model. Its struggles on the public market have not proven unique; Root and other similar companies have also failed to retain value after going public.

        "Extracted Article": "Just seven weeks after crypto exchange Gemini cut approximately 10% of its workforce due to “turbulent market conditions,” the startup has made a second round of layoffs, TechCrunch has learned, and there may be more on the way. The company had not widely communicated the extent of Mondays layoffs internally, leaving employees to speculate on the exact number of co-workers laid off in this most recent downsizing. A source close to the company noted that there was a reduction of 7%, or 68 members, in Gemini’s companywide Slack channel Monday morning. Gemini has not yet responded to a request for comment. Some venture investors are doubling down on crypto despite an unknown recovery timeline The same source, who spoke with TechCrunch under the condition of public anonymity, said that the company was laying off staff due to what it described as “extreme cost cutting.” Last week, an internal operating plan document was shared around the office and on an anonymous professional network Blind on July 14, but taken down shortly after, the source shared. The document highlighted a plan that would take the company to about 800 employees, which was around 15% fewer than the 950 employees at the time. “It’s come to my attention that at least one team member thinks its a good idea to post a snippet of our technology operating plan on a third party website (Blind),” Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, wrote in a Slack message at the time. “Wow, super lame … if you are leaking company information, you are exhibiting a low level of consciousness and respect for your fellow team members who greatly benefit from the openness we are trying to create and foster here.” Despite falling NFT sales volume, theres more underlying strength to the market than youd think TechCrunch viewed an image of the Slack message in question. Winklevoss also said that the message was a “friendly reminder that Karma is the blockchain of the universe — an immutable ledger that keeps track of positive and negative behavior.” “We are going to the moon. We are going to need cosmic consciousness to get there. Earthly consciousness will not be enough,” Winklevoss added. “If you are exhibiting the behavior of a first-time human, time to level-up or respectively bow out, if for no other reason but to avoid an expensive bill in the future.” In recent months, a wave of crypto-focused companies have laid off employees.

        "Extracted Article": "Wave, an African fintech that offers mobile money services in Senegal and Ivory Coast, laid off about 15% of its workforce last month. TechCrunch first got a whiff of the layoff news on LinkedIn, where Jessica Chervin, a former Andela executive who joined Wave as an expansion lead in March, wrote that she was leaving the company. “Like many tech companies, Wave is adjusting rapidly to the jarring changes in capital markets in recent months and like the best of them (and importantly, as a financial institution), it has had to make very hard calls in order to ensure that it can continue to serve customers in existing markets now and long into the future,” Chervin, who is also an angel investor, wrote. “This vital shift in strategic priorities means that I and many others are leaving Wave far earlier than anyone had hoped.” TechCrunch reached out to Wave for comment on the matter and a spokesperson confirmed that “close to 15%” of the company’s almost 2,000 staff were let go. Thus, the layoffs affected almost 300 employees, most of whom worked in Wave’s new markets: Burkina Faso, Mali and Uganda. According to a statement Wave released to its employees on June 30, the company said it was scaling back its teams in these markets as part of efforts to make sure it doesn’t have to depend on new funding at a time “when investors around the world are cutting back.” Wave said its decision to pull out from newer markets will help it double down on Senegal and Ivory Coast, core markets “where we are market leaders in mobile money with growing businesses,” as it continues to serve its new markets. In 2020, Wave officially spun off from Sendwave, a remittance platform that WorldRemit acquired for about $500 million in cash and stock. The company, which operated a stealth launch two years prior in Senegal, has since raised more than $290 million in equity and debt capital funding to date. The firm, run by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, was valued at $1.7 billion at its last fundraise last September after it raised $200 million, the largest Series A in Africa. It was led by Stripe, Sequoia Heritage, Founders Fund and Ribbit Capital. The startup’s other investors include Sam Altman and Partech Africa. Wave’s platform is akin to PayPal (with mobile money accounts, not bank accounts). It runs an agent network that uses cash on hand to service customers who can make free deposits and withdrawals and get charged a 1% fee whenever they send money. The company is disrupting the mobile money industry dominated by banks and telcos with its app-based solution, cheaper fees and QR-based tech. And despite its continuous squabble with these incumbents due to eating into their market share, Wave claims to serve more than 10 million users monthly across its operating markets. Wave is the first unicorn out of Senegal and the overall Francophone Africa region. However, its staff cuts across its five markets, Tunisia, Kenya, the U.S., Germany, Nigeria and the U.K. The companys spokesperson said that a small percentage of the released employees operated remotely across these countries. “The people we’re parting ways with are some of the smartest and most dedicated in our industry. Letting them go is one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make as a business,” the remainder of the statement read. “We regret the impact on employees and their families, but we feel strongly that the best way to honor these colleagues is to ensure their contributions last. Wave is offering enhanced benefits and packages to all affected employees to express our deep appreciation for their valuable contributions, hard work, and dedication.” As the global venture capital market slows, Africa charts its own course 10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully Layoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations. Big Tech companies have fired (Microsoft) and hinted at firing (Meta) employees. Small- to large-sized startups in various sectors, such as Substack, Hopin, Coinbase, Bolt, Byju, Twitter, PayPal and Tesla, have downsized too. And though it seemed, at first, that the knock-on effect would take a considerable amount of time before reaching Africa, news of layoffs from mobility startup Swvl and healthtech company Vezeeta made the rounds last month. However, just as the situation wasn’t dire for Swvl and Vezeeta, it isn’t for Wave. The Senegal-based startup likely has enough money in the bank for the next few years, and last week, it secured a €90 million syndicated loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Lendable, Norfund and other lenders in one of the largest debt deals on the continent. The loan, Wave said, will help it increase its customer base and grow operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast. SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going public Egyptian healthtech startup Vezeeta cuts 10% of 500-person staff Microsoft lays off a portion of its workforce as part of a realignment",

        "Extracted Article": "Fabric, a New York–based micro-fulfillment company focused on robotics technology for last-mile operations, has cut staff and named a new chief executive. The startup confirmed the changes to TechCrunch, essentially saying that it has seen the writing on the customer wall and is making some strategic changes. Today, the company officially announced its intentions to move in the direction of being a platform rather than a service. As a result, not everything with the new plan is positive: founding CEO Elram Goren was replaced by COO Avi (Jack) Jacoby 2 weeks ago, and the outfit told its 300-person staff Wednesday that 40% of them would be laid off. Fabric builds hardware and software for customer warehouses to automate the processes of selecting, moving around and packing items. We last covered the company in 2021 when it raised $200 million in Series C funding with some top investors behind it, including Temasek, which led both the C and Series B rounds. The company raised over $330 million in total and its valuation was over $1 billion. In the past year, however, the company’s customers began asking for different offerings than Fabric was currently providing, namely they wanted more of a platform offering than a service offering. Fabric’s current service is providing the real estate, deployment, commission, label and all of the services to maintain it. Shifting to a platform offering puts more in the hands of the customer, Jacoby told TechCrunch. He joined the company in 2018 as chief of staff and rose to the ranks of CEO of the Israel market. In 2020, he became Fabric’s chief operating officer. “Most of our customers told us they prefer to operate our system on their premises and with their own teams,” he said. “They would like to retain direct relations with the end customers and do not want anyone between the retailer and customer.” Fabric raises $200M at a $1B+ valuation for robotics-based fulfillment tech to help e-commerce players compete with Amazon Over the past 6 months, the company’s board of directors and leadership began looking at what that platform offering could look like. Jacoby explained that since starting the company 7 years ago, Goren had a “vision about building a network and providing a service to retailers.” “Once the board decided it didn’t see a demand for that in the market, that led to Elram’s decision to step down,” he added. “I think after seven years, he was pushing in that one direction.” Regarding the layoffs, Jacoby explained that as a service company, Fabric was providing the real estate, deployment, commissioning and once operational, the label and services. Now that it won’t be doing all of that, the employees who were let go fall into those categories, which include its R&amp;D teams and are mainly based in Israel, but the layoffs were across the organization, he added. The commercial teams were not impacted by the workforce reduction because the U.S. is still Fabric’s main market. Site operations, sales and marketing, product and finance were also not impacted. “We are going to expand in the U.S., but it doesnt make sense to shift R&amp;D to the U.S.,” he added. Impacted employees will be provided with a cash severance, extended benefits and job outplacement services, Jacoby said. Though Jacoby says he is seeing the trend of a slowdown in e-commerce, it did not have an impact on the decision regarding the shift to a platform business. It was instead listening to customers and their need to shift to automation, owning their micro-fulfillment system and operating it themselves. However, e-commerce has indeed been slowing down since the start of 2022. Forbes reported that Americans spent some $5.28 billion less online in April with part of the blame being placed on higher travel and gas prices that are cutting into people’s budgets for spending on goods. Jacoby reiterated that Fabric has “years of runway, is in a very good situation” and was not under pressure to make the decision. “We are just doing what we believe will position us better in the market,” he added. “What is happening to the market has nothing to do with it, and the companys financial situation is very good. This decision needed to be taken now because we need the runway to position ourselves better as a platform player.” https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/heres-how-to-protect-your-equity-if-you-get-laid-off/ New data underscores a slowing e-commerce market",

        "Extracted Article": "ChowNow, a startup that builds branded online ordering systems for restaurants, today announced layoffs internally, TechCrunch has learned. According to several sources who spoke to this reporter on the condition of anonymity, around 100 people were affected across teams, including onboarding, operations and sales. We, like every company, plan our annual budgets far ahead of the upcoming year. The budget we planned for 2022 was large and ambitious. Since then the economy and capital markets have changed, and so its prudent that we adjust as well, founder and CEO Chris Webb told TechCrunch via email. We made the difficult decision to lay off team members this week. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and they will receive our full support during this time of transition. These actions are never taken lightly, but we believe they are necessary in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the company and our commitment to supporting local restaurants. ChowNow launched in 2010 as a way for Webb and his friends to easily order delivery and pickup from smaller restaurants without an online presence. The company powers branded websites, apps, and social media accounts for restaurants as well as its own mobile and web ordering portals. ChowNow takes care of payments and delivery through agreements with companies like DoorDash and local delivery startups like Jolt Delivery in Los Angeles. It also provides discoverability and marketing services, for example partnering with Instagram to make pictures and stories from restaurants shoppable by adding order food buttons and stickers to the restaurants images and videos. The Culver City–based company positions itself as a friendlier alternative to incumbents like Grubhub and Uber Eats, charging a monthly fee instead of the per-order commissions typical of food delivery businesses. ChowNow also promises that restaurants on its platform retain their own customer data for marketing and insights. As of July 2022, ChowNow claimed it had over 22,000 restaurant customers across North America that were generating $2 billion worth of revenue combined through its platform. ChowNow has raised $64 million in venture capital to date, most recently a $21 million Series C round in 2019 led by 3L Capital and Catalyst Investors. Economic headwinds have hit the online food ordering space hard as investors pull back from what they perceive as capital-intensive bets. DoorDash recently shut down Chowbotics, a salad robot startup, just a year after it acquired the company for an undisclosed sum. Elsewhere, instant delivery company Gopuff announced this week that it would cut 10% of its global workforce — about 1,500 employees — and close 76 of its U.S. warehouses.",

The company, which went public last year via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, said the restructuring plan includes a targeted 30% reduction in spending across the entire business. It anticipates the reorganization could potentially impact up to 30% of employees globally. The plan would allow the company to meet its targets through late 2023 using the $500 million of cash it has on hard. The cuts are designed to keep Arrival on track to start production of its commercial EV van in the third quarter of this year, the company said. Arrival added that it must address challenges such as supply chain issues, an ongoing pandemic, geopolitical tensions and rising inflation now as it starts production this year. The company will provide more details on the plan during its second-quarter earnings call scheduled for August 11. Arrival is one in a growing list of EV companies issuing layoffs and slashing spending as economic conditions tighten. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told employees this week in an email viewed by TechCrunch that job cuts may occur. Tesla has also laid off hundreds of employees. While Arrival is staring down a considerable reduction in spending and layoffs, it has fared better than many of its EV SPAC brethren — a group of companies that have faced SEC investigations, insolvency and executive shuffling. The company, which has centered its business plan around using microfactories to build its products, announced in May that its electric bus model achieved certification in the European Union with customer models expected to be produced by the second half of this year. Arrival said in its first-quarter earnings report it expects to produce 400 to 600 vans plus low-volume production of buses in the second half of 2022. The report also notes that Arrival has collected a total of 143,000 nonbinding letters of intent and orders for its vehicles as of May, including the commitment from UPS to buy up to 10,000 vehicles from the startup in the U.S. and Europe.",

        "Extracted Article": "Airlift, Pakistan’s top startup, is shutting down in a move that has sent shock waves to the nascent but fast-growing ecosystem in the South Asian market. The Lahore-headquartered startup told employees Tuesday evening that it will be permanently ceasing operations on Wednesday, according to two sources and slides presented to them. The move comes after Airlift unsuccessfully attempted to put together a new financing round, deliberations of which continued as recently as last week, said one of the company slides, obtained by TechCrunch. Multiple investors told Airlift that it will take them over two months to wire the money, the startup told employees. Other investors [were] unwilling to assume the risk of wiring ahead of others, the slide said. Airlift operated a quick commerce service in eight Pakistani cities, including Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Users could order groceries, fresh produce and other essential items, including medicines, from the Airlift website or eponymous app and have it delivered to them in 30 minutes. Instant commerce as a category has made inroads worldwide in recent years, but they also tend to be some of the most capex heavy businesses. The startup raised $85 million in the countrys largest Series B funding round in August at a valuation of $275 million, the highest for any Pakistani startup. Harry Stebbings of 20VC and Josh Buckley of Buckley Ventures led that round. Airlift is also the most funded startup in Pakistan. Airlift was attempting to raise a new round earlier this year via SAFE at a $500 million valuation, according to a source with direct knowledge of the event. Update: Airlift founder Usman Gul confirmed to TechCrunch that the startup is shutting down and provided detailed notes about the events of recent months. The startups demise could hurt the local ecosystems enthusiasm. In the past three years, scores of global investors, including Tiger Global, Prosus Ventures and Addition, have backed young startups in Pakistan, giving a major vote of confidence to the market. We were never their investors, but I’m still sad for the people losing their jobs and who will be justifiably jaded by what just went down, tweeted Kalsoom Lakhani, GP at i2i Ventures, an early-stage focused venture firm in Pakistan. Im also worried that this will reflect poorly on Pakistan’s entire startup ecosystem, which is unfair to the MANY startups building well right now, growing without compromising their biz fundamentals. Failure in any startup ecosystem isn’t anomaly; it’s inevitable. The more we leave room for failure, the more we also create room for successes in their wake. Airlift was widely seen as the poster child of the Pakistans startup ecosystem. Pakistans then Prime Minister Imran Khan publicly congratulated the startup when it unveiled its Series B funding news. As a pioneering technology startup in Pakistan that had established a new precedent, Airlift’s success was viewed as a milestone for a burgeoning technology ecosystem in emerging markets. We believe that the ecosystem will continue to thrive and that some of the most valuable technology companies in emerging markets are still yet to be started, Gul wrote in a letter to staff Tuesday. My heart goes out to everyone working hard in the Pakistani tech ecosystem Airlift raised a monster Series B ($85M) &amp; was the poster child for the burgeoning Pak startup scene I ~really~ hope their failure is taken in context &amp; not as a reflection on the entire ecosystem https://t.co/DbaoLu4ksz &mdash; Ankur Nagpal (@ankurnagpal) July 12, 2022 Airlift says it will provide severance payments to employees in the next four to eight weeks and clear dues to suppliers and stakeholders. Teammates are not required to come to work beyond today access revoke will run by end-of-day Thursday, followed by communication via personal emails, the startup said in another slide, obtained by TechCrunch. Earlier this year, Airlift began expanding to South Africa, a move that significantly increased its expenses, a person familiar with the matter said. In a note to staff in May this year, obtained by TechCrunch, Gul warned that the market conditions had suddenly taken a turn for the worse as tech stocks reversed most of the gains following a 13-year bull run. Airlift needed to be extremely judicious in how capital is deployed and managed and was halting any new hires, Gul wrote at the time. He said the startups expansion to South Africa will remain in a nascent stage in FY 2022. In the note Tuesday, Gul said Airlift was able to achieve order-level profitability, maintain reasonable scale and reduce financial burn by 66%. As of July, 2022, Airlift was about three months away from operating profitability (i.e. positive cash flow from operations), and about 6-9 months from company-level profitability (i.e. Free Cash Flow), he wrote. It was also finalizing a new funding round when suddenly things well apart. With the above developments in May, one of our investors stepped up to lead Airlift’s Series C1 financing. We’ve received tremendous support from the potential lead in opening doors to other investors to put together the round. First Round Capital, Indus Valley Capital, Buckley Ventures, 20VC and other investors agreed to participate in the round with sizable checks, Gul wrote. In early July, Airlift had a clear path forward to close the round – the company pushed out documents for signatures to all participating investors. Last week, amidst rapidly deteriorating conditions in the global economy, several participants shared uncertainty in wire schedules and their disbursements – this ultimately meant that the company’s capital requirements would not be met. Ultimately, the round was unsuccessful, he added.

        "Extracted Article": "On May 16, Butler Hospitality, an on-demand platform for room service and amenities, sent an email to vendors that might have been considered reassuring under other circumstances. We are writing to inform you [that] room service and catering services will continue as is. All collateral is still functional, the email read. We appreciate your loyalty to sticking with us through these times. The trouble was, Butlers roughly 1,000-person workforce had been laid off just days earlier. In fact, most were told that the company had been dissolved according to interviews TechCrunch had with a number of former employees, and corroborated in a report last week by industry blog Restaurant Dive. Butler’s downfall is a cautionary tale both of the opportunities and challenges that exist in the world of on-demand startups. There may be clear gaps in the market for services that appear in theory like easy sailing. Yet they can inevitably be buffeted by economic, social and, in recent times, extreme public health headwinds. And amidst all that, those working there are the first to go over. On-demand delivery New York-based Butler was founded in 2016 as a ghost kitchen operator with a simple business model. Butler would lease a hotel kitchen on one property and use it to provide meal delivery services to in-house guests there and in other, nearby hotels. Butler founder and CEO Premtim Gjonbalic has experience in the hospitality industry. According to a Forbes profile, he opened his first restaurant in New York City at the age of 19 located inside a big-box hotel. Gjonbalic is also listed as an advisor to Fast Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company that unsuccessfully attempted to take Fertitta Entertainment, a dining, hospitality, and gaming giant, public. We are coming in and showing what the experience should be,” Gjonbalic told Crunchbase in a 2020 interview. You don’t need a cart in the room or a $20 service charge to deliver food. Guests want good packaging, a good menu, price transparency and to be able to track their order. This should have been happening a long time ago. Butler owned five different restaurant concepts that it staffed, including Standard by Butler (a casual bar and grill), Prime by Butler (an American brasserie) and Super Franc (a Tuscan steakhouse). Hotels could choose which concepts to have available to their guests; Butler handled the integration, experience, menu design and packaging. To customers, it pledged to deliver orders including convenience items on the side, like chargers and shaving cream in under 30 minutes, charged directly to their hotel bill. After a seed round and bootstrapped funding from Gjonbalic, Butler went on to raise $15 million in Series A contributions from The Kraft Group, &amp;vest, Scopus Ventures and Mousse Partners. The company subsequently raised $30 million from backers including Shamrock Holdings, Maywic Select Investments and Platform Ventures, bringing Butlers total raised to north of $50 million. In a press release issued last October, Butler said that it wanted to more than double its presence to 12 markets in the U.S., with plans to service rooms in cities including Boston, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh (expanding from its bases in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Miami, Denver, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.). The company said that Hilton, Hyatt, IHG and Marriott were among its more than 400 hospitality partners, which were big gets for the small operation. But some ex-employees say trouble was brewing behind the scenes. Signs of instability Butler no doubt took a hit as the pandemic depressed service and hospitality spending. In April 2020, the company received a $600,000 loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. But Butler, intent on expansion, continued to take on expensive new hotel restaurant leases. At one point, Butler was offering $500 prepaid Visa cards for every hotel partner successfully referred to it. Butler expanded its national footprint in 2021, hoping to capitalize on the travel recovery, Gjonbalic told TechCrunch via email. However, the startup found COVID-19 having both direct and indirect lasting effects, he added, among them labor and supply chain shortages, closed international borders, and continued delays of corporate and group travel. As travel recovered in late Q1 2022, Butlers challenges didnt go away, with inflation, geopolitical issues (i.e. the war in Ukraine), interest rate hikes and the bigger pressure on tech finance all creating a challenging fundraising environment for the startup. This led to commitments falling through abruptly, Gjonbalic said. But Gjonbalic and the rest of the companys senior leaders failed to communicate the severity of the situation, according to ex-staffers who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity. Just weeks prior to the mass firings, one ex-employee claims they were told Butler had no cash flow issues and that the next [financing] round was coming. Another says they were assured that the companys board of directors would give six months of runway regardless of how the next fundraise went. Some of the complaints have been more public and open. Kelly Buerger, a former launch manager for Butler, filed a class action lawsuit against the company in June alleging that Butler failed to give employees sufficient notice of their termination. Under the New York WARN Act and the federal WARN Act, companies employing 50 or more employees are generally required to give several weeks’ advance notice of mass layoffs. Beginning on or about April 22, 2022, and within 90 days therefrom, [Butler] terminated hundreds of its employees, the lawsuit alleges. [Butler] was required by the WARN Act to give [Buerger] and putative class members at least 60 days advance written notice of their termination [Butler also] failed to pay [Buerger] and each of the putative class members their respective wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, accrued holiday pay and accrued vacation for 60 days following their respective terminations, along with other vested compensation perks during the 60-day period. Some ex-Butler employees who were promised health benefits through August received an email a week after the dissolution indicating their plans would been terminated early. Layoffs begin Butler began taking extraordinary measures to preserve its remaining capital. An employee at one of Butlers hotel customers said the company began discontinuing services and introducing new fees without advanced warning. For example, Butler began charging for deliveries that previously had been free. Early in the year, there was a round of layoffs at Butler fewer than 20 people that management described to employees as a one-time thing. A few weeks later, about 50 people were furloughed in what Butler internally called a response to challenges. We regret to inform you that due to circumstances faced by [Butler] resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the critical need to conserve our cash resources, we have made the very difficult decision to place you on a temporary furlough, a notice received by one ex-Butler employee reads. We are hopeful that [Butlers] financial condition will improve, and we hope to recall you from temporary furlough to resume your position with [Butler] by no later than November 9, 2022. The larger-scale layoffs started in May, shortly after Butler hired a new COO and chief revenue officer. The company dissolved on May 13. Gjonbalic claims that the board and Butlers legal counsel at Cooley, a Palo Alto-based law firm, explored several options to try to save the company, but ultimately decided to shut down and dissolve the company on May 12. On May 13, Delaware counsel was retained to assist with the shutdown and to liquidate the business assets and the employees were terminated on May 13, Gjonbalic told TechCrunch in an email. Butler is not operational. The board agreed to shut down the company, but this is not something that happens overnight, so several excess liability hubs were assigned or transitioned back to hotel ownership to assist with accomplishing this as quickly as possible. Employees laid off during the final round, which included operational staff working at Butler-leased restaurants, were informed in a three-minute Google Meet call. An ex-employee told TechCrunch that services stopped abruptly after the companys dissolution; guests at one hotel with a Butler contract were suddenly unable to order room service. Vestiges of the company remain. An ex-employee with knowledge of the matter said that people formerly employed by Butler were direct-messaging the companys Instagram account, which remains active, to ask about missing payments. Much of Butlers senior leadership havent updated their profiles on LinkedIn to reflect the shutdown, and Butlers website makes no mention of it. Hotel owners and hotel management companies took over most of [Butlers] lease obligations, and fortunately my dad agreed to assume two of the remaining lease obligations and debts off the company’s hands, Gjonbalic said [in an email to TechCrunch]. An assignee is in place and he is handling all post-dissolution matters. Cautionary tale While an extreme example, Butler is hardly the only food delivery startup to have fallen on hard times recently. Instacart last month slashed its valuation by almost 40% and slowed hiring. Publicly traded DoorDash and Deliveroo have seen their stock prices fluctuate wildly over the past year. Gorillas, Getir, Zapp, Jokr and Gopuff are among other delivery startups that have let go staff in recent months, despite fundraising. And some have been forced to shut down entirely, like Fridge No More, 1520 and Buyk. Beyond foodtech, stories like Butlers are playing out with increasing frequency as investors tighten their belts, fearing a downturn. As one ex-Butler staffer put it, VC backers maintained an insatiable demand for growth, encouraging expansion that later proved to be foolhardy. Valuations became inflated, which caused unrealistic expectations and changes in direction and initiatives. Butler is a prime example of what’s happening in tech right now except instead of just 20% layoffs, the whole company went under, the staffer said.",

The layoff, conducted last month, comes after a period of rapid fundraising for Outschool. The firm raised its Series B, C and D in a 12-month period, most recently growing its valuation to $3 billion after hitting a $1 billion valuation just four months earlier. The capital was used to help Outschool grow from an early-stage startup into a growth stage company. In October 2021, the company announced it had attracted over $100 million in bookings on its platform. Nathoo then explained the need to staff up quickly to meet unprecedented demand; growing from 25 employees to 164. Now, the co-founder said “it’s no secret that market conditions have rapidly shifted.” “We recognized the need to be more defensive going into the second half of the year,” Nathoo said. “This was one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in my career but we have tried to do right by some truly talented and amazing people.” A spokesperson over email said that layoffs impacted all teams, including those at VP level, “to ensure that operations continue to be optimized companywide.” They also confirmed that 75% of the employees joined in the past two years. Outschool did not provide full details of severance but said that it was a “very generous package.” The company asserts that it has over three years of runway, with no need to raise anytime soon. Still, the layoffs put a brighter spotlight on the challenges of marketplace startups and the difficulty of being a growth-stage company that wants to serve children. Months ago, when I asked Nathoo about the clash of incentives between venture and its core clientele, he said that we’ve been venture funded from the very start, and I hope our actions, and how we go about our work reflects our values … the fact that venture funding hasn’t affected the fact that we’re a mission-driven company and values-driven company, and that’s not going to change.” Outschools after-school enrichment marketplace is now valued at $3 billion Outschool more recently has shifted focus from single customers to enterprise deals through schools or employer benefits. In the next five years, the company hopes that more than half of the enrollments on the platform are coming from employers and schools.",

        "Extracted Article": "Modsy, an online interior design services company, has ceased to offer design services, a move that comes at the cost of the team behind the effort and customers who have orders in flux. In an email to TechCrunch, Modsy CEO Shanna Tellerman provided this statement when asked about the disruption of business: We have worked hard over the past seven years to build Modsy and never expected we would have to disrupt our business. Our focus has always been, and still is, on our customers. We intend to fulfill customer merchandise orders and we are working through a process for our design service customers. We ask for your patience as we work through this plan. I hope that for many people, the Modsy story will not be defined by this turn of events, and we are truly sorry. We would like to thank our team, our designers, and our customers. TechCrunch sent a series of questions in response to the statement including queries about the below information from sources but has not yet heard back at time of publication. Late last week, sources say that the company was expecting to be acquired but that the deal fell through, leaving designers at the company without a job. The potential acquirer is not known. Employees later found out that Modsy is pivoting to offer a SaaS platform, Modsy Pro, as a software service for interior designers. On Modsy’s website, Modsy Pro is described as “online interior design software that will transform the way you do business … bring your client’s space to life with our proprietary room-scan technology, 3D renders, and easily editable and shoppable designs.” The landing page offers a way for users to apply for early access for the still-beta product. Modsy’s initial business model revolved around selling interior design services on top of an AI-powered platform. Using the company’s apps, property owners could create virtual renderings of their rooms and restyle them in real time. The company’s technology digitally replicated rooms in 360 degrees with furniture from well-known brands, including West Elm, Crate &amp; Barrel and Anthropologie. Users could purchase fixtures — whether a rug, couch or coffee table — either through Modsy directly or through partner tools like Crate &amp; Barrel’s 3D Room Designer. Modsy had customers snap photos and take measurements of their rooms and complete a style quiz indicating their preferences, budget and constraints. Modsy forwarded this information onto designers, at which point customers got virtual design plans of their rooms. Customers could then consult with Modsy’s team or fine-tune the designs with a self-service tool. Image Credits: Oracle NetSuite (opens in a new window) Just in March, Modsy launched what it called a first-of-its-kind virtual renovation design service for space types including patios and structural add-ons. The new service allowed customers to visualize home improvements before construction began, generating renovation designs for contractors, builders, and architects as well as finish, materials, furniture, and fixture recommendations. The new product rollout comes as operations are disrupted elsewhere, both at the cost of employees and customers. It also comes at a time of uncertainty. Generally, communication from Modsy has been inconsistent throughout the layoffs, customers — who spoke on the condition of anonymity — tell TechCrunch. One customer had been in touch with a Modsy designer for about a week when the correspondence suddenly stopped. Then they received an email from the designer informing them of the pivot. I personally would like to extend my sincere apologies for this sudden business pivot, the message reads. For the majority of us here at Modsy, today is our last day. However, this is a small team staying on for a little while to help wrap things up with customers such as yourself. We are working hard to get everyones inquiries as quickly as we can, but please expect delays in response time. It could be a few business days before someone gets back to you. Furniture orders appear to have been impacted by the personnel changes, too. A customer told TechCrunch items were sitting in their cart as of the evening of June 28, awaiting processing. A second customer, whod been working with a Modsy designer since early May, was told by customer support that cancellations couldnt be processed and to try again later. When they tried to use Modsys app to cancel an order that wasnt scheduled to arrive until October, they saw a notification saying that all order processing had been halted. The same customer received an email from Modsys support team promising to fulfill all outstanding orders, including backorders. We are currently experiencing delays in the ability to process cancellations, but if you wish to cancel something, just let us know, and we will put you in queue, a support staffer wrote. A third customer TechCrunch spoke to had begun working with a Modsy designer on June 5. After several video calls, the customer received a note from their designer saying that they’d been let go. When they tried to contact the designer for more information, they discovered that Modsy’s in-app chat feature had been disabled. “I have not received any information from Modsy except for [a strange email from my designer] yesterday saying she was let go,” one customer wrote in an email to Modsy’s customer service. “Our project hasn’t started yet, so I’m confused and frustrated about what is going on. Of course, there are competitors, and I specifically chose Modsy — but we are moving into a new home, and I have a sensitive timeline that now is unlikely to be met.” Today, some Modsy customers reported that they began seeing a prompt in the mobile app requiring them to “upgrade” to the latest version. But no update was available through the App Store, making the app effectively nonfunctional. Modsy support has been directing customers requesting a refund to a Google Form. Several customers were told refunds would take one to two weeks. Backers in Modsy included Comcast Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and NBCUniversal. The companys last funding round closed in May 2019, bringing Modsys total raised to $72.7 million, according to Crunchbase data. Modsy has explored a number of potential new lines of business throughout its history. At one point, the company even developed and sold its own furniture line, Minna Home, which spanned several different styles of sofas and chairs. It also launched a partnership with homebuilding company Lennar to create online model home tours. The company had a round of layoffs in the beginning of the pandemic, cutting a solid chunk of employees and contractors and slashing executive salaries. At the time, Tellerman attributed the workforce reduction to “an effort to maintain a sustainable business during these unprecedented circumstances.” The April 2020 layoff also saw designers lose their jobs. Modsy took a hit on the logistics side during the pandemic as global supply chains ground to a halt. Amanda Kwan-Rosenbush, senior director of finance and accounting at Modsy, previously described shipping as a significant cost, and said that Modsy’s furniture and décor partners struggled with long delays. As an article in Business of Home notes, however, the e-design platform space is no stranger to failures. Laurel &amp; Wolf and Homepolish shut down in 2019, and Décor Aid, smaller company, shuttered in 2021.",

        "Extracted Article": "Vezeeta, a healthtech startup operating in the Middle East and Africa, reportedly laid off about 10% of its staff last week. The number of affected employees isn’t known; however, multiple sources who posted the news on LinkedIn, including affected employees, revealed that up to 50 people were let go. Vezeeta has almost 500 employees, according to its LinkedIn page. TechCrunch reached out to the Egypt- and Dubai-based company for comment but didn’t get any response at the time of publication. The last time we covered Vezeeta was in 2020, when it raised $40 million in Series D funding (the joint largest single healthtech round in Africa alongside Reliance Health) from Gulf Capital and Saudi Technology Ventures (STV). According to its CEO Amir Barsoum, the healthtech company has received $73 million in total and is generally touted as one of Africas and the Middle East’s soonicorns. Vezeeta’s business has evolved from the “Uber for Ambulance” model it launched in 2012 to what it is now: a subscription-based doctor booking and consultation platform. As of 2020, it was operating in 50 cities across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon and claimed its userbase had grown 3x year-over-year to 4 million patients, with 30,000 healthcare providers using its software-as-a-service solution. But currently, the platform caters to 10 million patients across 78 cities (including Nigeria and Kenya, its latest addition) via three outpatient touchpoints: doctor consultations, pharmacy and diagnostics. Like many healthtech startups in the region and globally, Vezeeta benefited from pandemic-induced funding, and before this news, there was no indication that the 10-year-old company needed to cut costs. But if there’s anything the current venture capital landscape has shown, no sector is immune to layoffs, as startups from real estate, crypto, q-commerce and fintech (among others) laid off nore than 16,000 employees just last month. https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/heres-how-to-protect-your-equity-if-you-get-laid-off/ There are a few notable examples in the U.S. healthtech space. Earlier this month, Carbon Health, a virtual care provider, laid off 8% of its workforce, citing the need to “adapt to the changing market conditions.” Last week, healthcare unicorn Ro, after recently raising $150 million at a $7 billion valuation, relieved 18% of its staff from their duties to “manage expenses, increase the efficiency of our organization and better map our resources to our current strategy.” Other platforms globally, as reported by Layoffs.fyi, include the likes of PharmEasy, Sami and Truepill. Vezeeta is the first major player in Africa and the Middle East to be affected. The healthtech company didn’t release any statements detailing what led to its decision or plans going forward, but affected employees stated reasons Vezeeta probably highlighted in its discussion with staff. One said the layoffs were a result of “disasters in the market,” while another said it was “due to the global market crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.” This layoff news is the second coming from an Egypt-born but Dubai-based company in quick succession. In May, publicly traded mobility startup SWVL announced plans to lay off 32% of its workforce. The company noted changes to its financial realities and the need to implement a portfolio optimization program to “focus on its highest profitability operations, enhance efficiency and reduce central costs.” Layoffs hit crypto and real estate tech particularly hard this week This is not (just) another roundup of tech layoffs 10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully",

In a written statement, CEO Adam Hughes said: Due to the current macro-economic environment, we have decided to take some proactive adjustments to ensure Amount’s ability to thrive for years to come. We believe these actions are the prudent thing to do for the long-term health of the company and remain extremely excited about the future. Amount was spun out of Avant — an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity — in January of 2020 to provide enterprise software built specifically for the banking industry. It partners with banks and financial institutions to “rapidly digitize their financial infrastructure and compete in the retail lending and buy now, pay later sectors,” Hughes told TechCrunch last year when the company announced it had raised $99 million in a Series D funding round at a valuation of just over $1 billion. In total, Amount has raised $243 million to date. Investors include WestCap and Goldman Sachs, among others. In simple terms, Amount’s mission is to help financial institutions “go digital in months — not years” and thus, better compete with fintech rivals. The company formed just before the pandemic hit, after which demand for the type of technology Amount had developed increased exponentially, the company said. At the time of that last raise, Hughes told TechCrunch that Amount’s clients included financial institutions collectively managing nearly $2 trillion in U.S. assets and servicing more than 50 million U.S. customers. Hughes declined to provide any details regarding the company’s financials, saying only that Amount “performed well” as a standalone company in 2020 and that the company was expecting “significant” year-over-year revenue growth in 2021. He did say that HSBC, TD Bank, Regions, Banco Popular and Avant (of course) were among the 10 banks that used Amount’s technology in an effort to simplify their transition to digital financial services.

        "Extracted Article": "Ro, a healthcare unicorn that last raised $150 million just months ago at a $7 billion valuation, has cut 18% of its staff to “manage expenses, increase the efficiency of our organization and better map our resources to our current strategy,” leadership wrote in an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch and confirmed by multiple sources. “Due to our obligation to protect patient healthcare information, there will not be a transition period for those departing the company,” the e-mail continues. “We know that this will feel abrupt and hope you can find alternative ways to connect to say goodbye to your teammates.” Impacted employees will get two months of severance pay and support for job placement. The healthcare unicorn is offering two months of paid healthcare benefits. Ro confirmed the news to TechCrunch and provided a copy of the aforementioned e-mail that CEO Zachariah Reitano sent to staff. A spokeswoman said that Ro is still hiring. The layoff today, per one source, impacts most of Ros recruiting team. Another source says that the announcement was unexpected, and that current employees were told about the workforce reduction via Zoom without the chance to ask any questions. In the e-mail, Ro asserts that people who were impacted by the layoffs were told in 1:1 conversations. In the email, leadership says it took steps over the past six months to prepare for a possible downturn, including narrowing focus and raising additional capital. The capital theyre alluding to, despite being at a higher valuation, was solely funded by existing investors. The financing event was less than its preceding round. The absence of new investors signaled that the company stuck to people who already have financial stakes in the company’s future success. Ro’s decision to lay people off comes after a number of executives left the company, including Ro COO George Koveos, GM of Ro Pharmacy Steve Buck and most recently, Modern Fertility co-founder Afton Vechery. Vechery’s departure, which happened around one year after her company was acquired by Ro, has been rumored for over six months — first sparked by an employee exodus that peaked last year. At that time, former and current employees spoke to rising tensions at Ro that were caused by the health tech company’s inability to gain meaningful revenue from newer products. Its ED line continues to account for half of the health tech unicorn’s revenue. In a statement, the company said that, alongside its acquisition and pharmacy growth, it launched Ro Mind for mental health and Ro Derm for skincare. In a statement in response to TechCrunch’s 2021 investigation into Ro’s culture and business, Reitano said that Derm is on pace to do over $20 million in revenue in 2021. He also said that non-Roman revenue is growing faster than Roman, reportedly 150% year over year. In a previous, separate email sent to employees, Ro leadership said that they will put “more energy and resources toward fewer initiatives for the remainder of Q2 and H2. “Narrowing the focus does not mean we will launch any fewer products or services for patients. In fact, we believe it will have the opposite effect. We will increase the speed of innovation for patients,” the memo continues, also noting that it will build “new products for existing patients.” “The mantra for the remainder of the year (and potentially beyond) will be growth with discipline,” the e-mail continued. Quite a different feel than just last year when the company raced to be the “Amazon of healthcare.” Current and former Ro employees can contact Natasha Mascarenhas by e-mail at natasha.m@techcrunch.com or on Signal, a secure encrypted messaging app, at 925 271 0912.

        "Extracted Article": "MasterClass, an education platform that sells subscriptions to celebrity-taught classes, has cut 20% of its team to “adapt to the worsening macro environment and get to self-sustainability faster,” CEO David Rogier tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. The layoff impacts roughly 120 people across all teams, but no C-suite executives were cut, a MasterClass spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “Our mission — to make it possible for anyone to learn from the best — hasn’t and won’t change,” Rogier continued on Twitter. “This very tough step will strengthen our position both financially and strategically, allowing us to serve our members, employees and instructors for many years to come.” Today is a sad day @masterclass. I made the really hard decision to reduce our team by 20% to adapt to the worsening macro environment and get to self sustainability faster. &mdash; David Rogier (@drogier) June 22, 2022 A MasterClass spokesperson said that the company will be offering 11 weeks of base pay to all employees as part of a severance package, with one additional week for every year spent at MasterClass. The company is also waiving the one-year investing cliff, and employees will have the chance to extend options. The startup has committed to covering employee healthcare through the end of the year. It is also providing mental health counseling until the end of the year and job counseling for the next three months. Laptops can be kept for personal use. There is no hiring freeze, the spokesperson confirmed. When asked for more specifics on what triggered the layoff, the spokesperson pointed to Rogiers Twitter and LinkedIn statements. MasterClass made a splash during the early innings of the pandemic by meeting a newfound consumer interest in remote education with aspirational content (aka, entertainment) from celebrities such as Serena Williams and Issa Rae. Offering paywalled, documentary-style content, MasterClass has raised more than $460 million in known venture capital from investors including IVP, NEA and Owl Ventures. Its model even inspired other companies: Outlier, founded by MasterClass’ co-founder, closed a $30 million Series B, and former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparov launched a “MasterClass for chess lovers” platform. MasterClass charges a $180 annual subscription fee for users to access its library of content. The subscription model was responsible for 80% of the company’s revenue in 2018, and, as of late, is responsible for 100% of its revenue. The company was last valued at $2.75 billion, sources told CNBC. While it is celebrated for leading the edutainment category, MasterClass has always had some clear hurdles to surpass, including getting users who gravitate to the platform for one class to stick around for other classes. The company has also spent heavily on marketing and on instruction. In 2017, the Hollywood Reporter said that most MasterClass instructors are paid at least $100,000 up front and receive a share of at least 30% of the revenue; it seems likely that those numbers have increased over the last five years. What the MasterClass effect means for edtech MasterClass isnt the only edtech scaling back after a period of spotlight. Eruditis, an edtech unicorn, laid off 40 people and had 40 people resign voluntarily, reports Inc42. The publication says that people on the talent acquisition, or hiring, team were impacted as Eruditis scales back its hiring plans, from bringing on 1,300 people over the past 12 months to only wanting 150 more people, at most, this year. Section4, an upskilling startup launched by prominent NYU professor Scott Galloway, also laid off a quarter of staff, largely impacting the product team. Then, of course, in April, per the Economic Times, richly valued Indian edtech Unacademy laid off 1,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting measure. The same outlet reports that Vedantu, another edtech unicorn, cut 200 employees. Public edtech companies Duolingo and Coursera have also seen stock values slashed. Layoffs hit crypto and real estate tech particularly hard this week",

        "Extracted Article": "Singapore-based crypto exchange Bybit has joined a long list of companies that have laid off some of their employees. As the cryptocurrency market is facing tremulous times, firms are finding new ways to cut costs and stay afloat. Crypto journalist James Wu first noted the news about Bybits layoffs yesterday. He said that the company is cutting a whopping 30% of its 2,000 people workforce. Bybit is highly dependent on professionalism and rapid execution capabilities. We are exploring a way to remove overlapping functions and build smaller but more agile teams to improve our efficiency. Starting from this week, some of the functions and roles will be reviewed to ensure we stay focused and agile, the company said in a statement. To support the smooth transition of the process, affected colleagues will be accorded a severance package and access to Bybit’s employee career support in their job transition. Bybit said it has 6 million registered users with more than 190,000 users, who are trading futures or spots on the exchange daily. The firm had spent heavy money on marketing over the last year, including a sponsorship deal with F1 team Red Bull Racing, reportedly worth $150 million. Last week, Coinbase said that its cutting its workforce by 18% — almost 1,100 people. Crypto.com CEO Kris also said the company is laying off 5% (260 people) of its staff. Lending platform BlockFi was another firm that aims to save costs by giving a pink slip to 20% (850 people) of its employees. The Crypto market is currently facing a winter as prices of different tokens and coins have plummeted. Over the weekend, Bitcoin dipped below $19,000 and Ether dipped below $1,000, only to recover during the last few days. Several crypto financial service providers like Celcius and Babel Finance have frozen withdrawals as they are trying to battle the downturn in the market. In an interview with NPR over the weekend, crypto exchange FTXs founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said that increase in interest rates by Fed is driving this crypto bear market.

The Gurugaon-headquartered startup, which has raised over $110 million and counts General Catalyst, Norwest Venture Partners and Jungle Ventures among its backers, said it is cutting the jobs to bring about “structural changes across functions at CityMall.” The layoff impacts at least 30% of the three-year-old startup’s workforce, according to a LinkedIn analysis. CityMall works with over 30 000 micro-entrepreneurs to power its e-commerce engine in about 30 Indian cities. The startup said two months ago that it had over 500 employees. After exploring multiple options, weve realized that there [are] certain roles within the company which had to be dissolved to align to our evolving business model and the current business environment,” the startup said in a LinkedIn post. The three-year-old startup said it will work with the affected employees to help them land jobs. “Each and every employee affected by this layoff has contributed to building CityMall to what it is today, and this is one of the toughest decisions the company has ever had to make,” the startup said. The Sunday announcement marks the latest in a growing series of layoffs among Indian startups. BlinkIt, formerly known as Grofers, a struggling online grocer, online learning platforms Unacademy, Eruditus and Vedantu, cars marketplace Cars24, fintech Rupeek, social commerce Meesho and online pharmacy PharmEasy are among startups that have let go employees in recent weeks. Jobs of over 9,500 employees in India have been eliminated this year due to the market correction (or so has been the single most popular excuse.)

        "Extracted Article": "On-demand food delivery company JOKR said it was shuttering its New York and Boston deliveries as of June 19 and leaving the U.S. market altogether, with co-founder and CEO Ralf Wenzel saying the startup is going to focus on Latin America. “We have decided to stop our business activities in the U.S. for now, which have lately only accounted for about 5% of our business and with a very differently structured opportunity,” Wenzel said in a statement. “Given our unique position in Latin America, we decided to increase our investments in the region organically and by exploring complementary inorganic opportunities, expand our geographic footprint and expand on our service offering to become the leading and most customer serving online grocery business across Latin America, a 1.2tn retail market with less than 10% online penetration.” T​he New York and Boston operations accounted for nine micro-fulfillment centers out of JOKR’s network of approximately 200 worldwide, according to Bloomberg. The move will also cut about 50 workers from its 950-person office staff. In JOKR’s one-year lifespan, it has taken in more than $430 million, including a $260 million Series B round last November. At that time, the company said its valuation was $1.2 billion and touted itself as “one of the fastest companies to reach unicorn status in history.” Perhaps it was a little too early for the company to toot its own “horn.” Even though JOKR hadn’t been in New York for that long, the news isn’t much of a surprise, actually, for a few reasons. First, I spoke to Wenzel in April, and asked him about an Information story from February that discussed JOKR possibly selling its New York operations. At the time, Wenzel called it a rumor, telling me, “We’ve been operating in New York, and there’s no strategic shifts.” However, he also hinted that the company was looking at its footprint in New York, saying, “In terms of looking into the warehouse distribution, we opened new warehouses and we closed other warehouses as we looked into what was the right location, what was the right proximity to different customers.” While the company was mum on where, Wenzel’s comments implied that closings were likely ahead. Even though some food delivery companies, like Buyk, Fridge No More and Zero Grocery folded earlier this year, it didn’t sound like things were that dire over at JOKR. Wenzel said JOKR had been focused on “reinventing retail,” over the past 12 months, which entailed “how to especially disrupt the supply chain and procurement side of things.” When asked how that strategy was working out, Wenzel replied that things had been going so well that “we have now become fully gross profit positive on a group level for our local business across all of our countries after 12 months of operations.” Second, as mentioned, food delivery companies are facing tough times as funding dried up and the rush to invest into this sector, partly as a result of the global pandemic, caused it to become quite inflated and due for a course-correct. This became evident when some of JOKR’s competitors began announcing layoffs. For example, in May, Gopuff, Gorillas and Getir announced staff reductions. Zapp also had layoffs. TechCrunch took a deeper look at what was happening in the on-demand delivery space earlier this month and what it means for the industry going forward. Perhaps faster delivery times were a poor choice from a unit-economics perspective The delivery market is coming down from its pandemic highs",

        "Extracted Article": "Clearco, a Toronto-based fintech capital provider for online companies, is walking back the international expansion it once touted as the future of the company. One month after cutting 25% of its total staff, Clearco is conducting another round of layoffs as it retracts its international presence in the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Australia. CEO and co-founder Michele Romanow tells TechCrunch over e-mail that Clearco had to let go of approximately 60 more employees on the international teams. The latest workforce reduction is just one step Clearco has taken over the past few months, including prior rounds of layoffs, to refocus its business operations amid the changing e-commerce scene. Similar to other employees laid off by the company, those impacted will receive severance pay, a two-year window to exercise equity and job support. As Clearco’s international workforce is cut, its global clients will now turn to Outfund, an e-commerce investor that operates in the U.K. and Australia. Clearco describes the “strategic partnership” as one where its international clients — which span Australia, the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands — will be able to now go to Outfund for support. Romanow said that customers will be transitioned to Outfund through a referral agreement, meaning that Clearco will make money off of the partnership. Outfund, claims Clearco, has committed to invest £500 million in small businesses in 2022. Clearco, meanwhile, will return to focus on its two biggest markets: the United States and Canada, which both account for 80% of its activity. To give you a sense of scale, Clearco invested over $3.2 billion in companies across the world, but only $429 million — or 13% — of that activity was in companies outside of those core two markets. The company partnered with FirePower last year to expand its check-writing ability to back the two markets. It’s a move that isn’t all too surprising for those who have been following the SoftBank-backed unicorn. When Clearco cut a quarter of staff in July, Romanow said at the time that it was considering strategic options for its international operations. Clearco expanded to Germany in June but simultaneously cut 10% of its staff in Ireland, just three months after breaking into the market and announcing plans to hire over 100 employees, reports Independent.ie. Clearco does have a host of international competition, including, but not limited to, Pipe, Divibank, Uncapped and Wayflyer. Despite the crowded space, Clearco attempted a global growth move fueled by fresh venture capital money. Romanow said “there was huge demand in line with the economic growth we were seeing during the pandemic with e-commerce businesses.” “We were really excited and ambitious about our growth,” she said. “We just had no way to predict the current macroeconomic environment, which frankly looks worse in Europe than in the U.S. Compounded with a slowdown in e-commerce growth meant we suddenly faced significant headwinds internationally that simply didn’t exist six months ago.” Romanow isn’t the first founder to conduct multiple rounds of layoffs in quick succession over the past few months. Robinhood, On Deck, Gemini and Hopin all make the same, troubling list. The entrepreneur, who co-founded the business with her former partner Andrew D’Souza years ago, said that she would “probably pause more before making hiring decisions too quickly even if all of the signs in the market seem to be pointing that way.” “The desire to build an amazing team to support rapid expansion as quickly as possible and the need to be prudent and think about sustainability and stability first and foremost is a very delicate balance,” she added. “I would encourage other founders to be as proactive as possible, especially with difficult decisions.” As for the future of Clearco, it sounds like there’s more focus and simplification to come. Romanow admits that the product hasn’t always been “the most simple to understand” and that there are changes coming to the revenue-based financing tools they provide. The company last raised venture capital money in July 2021, a $215 million round led by SoftBank Vision Fund II. That financing event closed just weeks after Clearco completed its most recent financing, a $100 million round that quintupled its valuation to $2 billion.",

        "Extracted Article": "Policygenius, an insurtech that raised $125 million in a Series E round less than three months ago, has reportedly laid off about 25% of its staff. The number of employees affected is not confirmed but is believed to be around 170, according to multiple sources. One employee posted on LinkedIn today that he was among the 25% of staff that were let go. In a statement provided via email, Jennifer Fitzgerald, CEO and co-founder of Policygenius, did not confirm that number, saying: As with many companies, the sudden and dramatic shift in the economy has forced us to adapt our strategy. After careful consideration, we announced the difficult and necessary decision to reduce the size of our workforce. With these changes, we remain confident in the future of our company, our continued innovation, and the excellent service we continue to provide our customers every day. This is a difficult day for us at Policygenius, and especially for our employees who have been directly impacted. We’re saying goodbye to friends and colleagues who have, through their hard work and dedication, helped build this company and deliver on our mission for our customers. We’re grateful for their many contributions and wish them all the best. At the time of its Series E in March, Policygenius — whose software essentially allows consumers to find and buy different insurance products online — said that its home and auto insurance business had “grown significantly,” with new written premiums having increased “more than 6x from 2019 to 2021.” In a press release, the company said: “Policygenius continues to be the only tech-enabled brokerage and distribution platform to have successfully scaled and diversified across life and home and auto insurance. The company will use the new capital to continue to invest in the growth of its core businesses of life, disability, home, and auto insurance, as well as new no-exam life insurance offerings and Policygenius Pro.” Since its 2014 inception, Policygenius has raised over $250 million from investors such as KKR, Norwest Venture Partners and Revolution Ventures as well as strategic backers such as Brighthouse Financial, Global Atlantic Financial Group, iA Financial Group, Lincoln Financial and Pacific Life. Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois de Lame, co-founders of Policygenius. Image Credits: Policygenius While we can’t speak specifically to Policygenius, it’s been widely reported how poorly insurtech companies have fared in the public markets over the past year with Lemonade, Root and Hippo all trading significantly lower than their opening prices. For example, as my colleague Alex Wilhelm wrote in January, Lemonade, which sells rental insurance, went public in early July 2020. Root, which focuses on auto insurance, went out in October of the same year. Metromile, also in auto insurance, went public via a SPAC in February 2021. And, finally, Hippo, focused on home coverage, went public via a blank check company in August of last year. It was quite the run of liquidity for companies that racked up impressive venture backing in their early days. Since then, Metromile announced that it would sell itself to Lemonade after losing nearly all of its value; today, Metromile is worth around $1.12 per share, down from a 52-week high of $12.74 per share. Its peers also struggled. Lemonade has seen its value erode from $115.85 per share to $21.72 as of the time of writing. Root is worth $1.48 per share, down from a 52-week high of $14.70. Hippo is down to $1.42 per share from its 52-week high of $10.82. Alex and team have covered the carnage over the last few quarters. In January, Root also conducted a layoff that affected 330 people, citing pandemic challenges. My weekly fintech newsletter, The Interchange, launched on May 1!

        "Extracted Article": "“We have all seen the state of the market,” IRL CEO and co-founder Abraham Shafi wrote in a company-wide memo where the social app announced it would be dramatically cutting staff. Similar to dozens of startups over the past few weeks, IRL has just announced its laying off 25% of its team, or around 25 people, citing market dynamics. The cut comes around a year after the startup landed a $170 million SoftBank-led Series C and hit coveted unicorn status. What’s different from recent layoffs, though, is the company’s tone. “Courage is a decision, and we will choose courage,” Shafi wrote in the memo, obtained by TechCrunch. “Whatever we are facing today can’t be any worse than the uncertainty we met at the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic.” Regardless of the state of the pandemic, though, layoffs force workers into an unexpected period of precariousness, augmented by the impending loss of health insurance. Regarding the decision to cut staff, Shafi wrote that IRL has “more than enough cash to last well into 2024.” Over the last year, the startup increased its head count by 3.5 times, but Shafi noted that WhatsApp was able to grow to 450 million users with a team of 55. This suggests that the workforce reduction was less about trying to reduce runway and more about right-sizing the team after a period of overhiring. Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging, the CEO wrote. Like the Olympics, we know most people don’t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you. Throughout the memo, Shafi emphasizes the employees necessity to adapt and be disciplined. I have been reflecting on Darwin’s observation that the highest indicator of survival for any living organism is not brute force strength, but how quickly it can adapt to its changing environment, Shafi wrote. This company is a living organism, and our ability to adapt to our changing environment is of the utmost importance. Going forward, IRL is focused on being an engineering-led organization, suggesting that the layoffs impacted other teams. An employee at IRL, who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the layoffs and said that they “support the move and respect it.” “It shows a SoftBank company is taking responsibility, usually SoftBank companies get criticized a lot,” they said. “Financially, I know we’re good because I heard we have around $100 million still in the bankyears and years of runway.” The employee, who was not impacted by this layoff, said that the startup has a ton of new features, partnerships and prototypes in the works to create a more meaningful service in the future. IRL was founded in 2017 as a way to help users find real-world events, but when the pandemic hit, the platform pivoted to prioritize the discovery of online events. The company told TechCrunch at the time of its Series C that it had 20 million registered users, with 400% growth over a 15-month period. But some employees told The Information that they were skeptical of the accuracy of these numbers. Its unclear if IRLs user growth played a role in todays layoffs, but its more likely a combination of factors, including also the current economic downturn thats impacting the tech industry more broadly. Even as global lockdowns have eased, IRL remained dedicated to its new, digital-first strategy while also allocating money from its Series C to help bring back in-person events. At the same time, IRL also invested in its integration with TikTok and thought of itself as a potential “WeChat of the West.” It later acquired the digital nutrition startup AeBeZe Labs with an eye on making its service a healthier social app. While the co-founder cites macroeconomic environment as reasoning to adapt, he also talked about how both individual economic hardship and recent tragedies like mass shootings could increase the demand for “humans’ need to feel connection and intimacy,” which is IRL’s mission. “Now, our mission is not for the faint of heart. There will be naysayers, critics, hackers, spammers and so on, he continued. “We will succeed as long as we focus on what we know and what we can control. Not just for us but our users worldwide.” Shafi confirmed the layoffs, and provided the following statement to TechCrunch: “As we assess our path forward, we’ve had to make the unfortunate decision to reduce our team. Were grateful for each of these individuals contributions in bringing IRL’s mission to life as well as the impressive business acumen that they brought to the table everyday. We wish our former teammates the best on their journeys ahead; They are talented people, and we have no doubt they will thrive anywhere. As such, along with the offered severance, we’ll provide any support where we can for those who may want it in their search for their next endeavor. As for what’s next for IRL, we’ll remain focused on building a product and community that creates more fulfilling human connections for the next generation.” You can read the memo he sent to staff, per sources, in its entirety below: Dear IRL Team, Today was tough. We had to lay off many talented people, which is never easy. The journey ahead isn’t easy either, but I am confident that it will be easier with all of you. We have all seen the state of the market. It is the worst since 2007-2008, but this is not a time to panic. Instead, this is a time to make the most of constraints. Courage is a decision, and we will choose courage. Whatever we are facing today can’t be any worse than the uncertainty we met at the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic. Let’s remember that great tech companies were forged during more challenging economic times. Many of the great products and services we all use today (Uber, AirBnB, etc…) caught their stride during a downturn, and we will be no different. We can’t control market dynamics, but we can control how we invest our time and resources in any market dynamic. To increase our success, we will continue to be more disciplined with our time and resources. We also needed to downsize our team to the fundamentals in service of our focus. Exercising discipline and adaptation to our current environment means moving from a 100-person team to a ~75-person team. With a focus on being an engineering led organization. To put it into perspective, this is still a 3.5x increase in headcount from a year ago. Gratefully we have more than enough cash to last well in 2024 and now is the time to be offensive, diligent, and proactive. Whatsapp was able to grow to 450M users with a team of 55. I am inspired by that and I believe we will forge our own amazing story with a small but incredibly amazing team. I have been reflecting on Darwin’s observation that the highest indicator of survival for any living organism is not brute force strength, but how quickly it can adapt to its changing environment. This company is a living organism, and our ability to adapt to our changing environment is of the utmost importance. Our goal remains the same, to provide a product and a set of tools that helps to truly bring the entire world closer together through shared interests, communities, and more intimate and meaningful conversations. The world is going through a collective struggle of inflation, higher cost of goods, layoffs, school shootings, and many experiencing loneliness and depression. During these kinds of shifts, humans’ need to feel connection and intimacy through tough times increases massively. Our mission has never been more critical than it is now. I am not saying we can solve all human suffering or loneliness entirely, but if we can even play our role enabling any meaningful impact, it’s worth it . The way things get better is by everyone doing their best to help make the world a little nicer, a little softer, and a little more friendly. All of that compounds into real impact. One of the intentional decisions I made in building our product is to focus on making the business success symbiotic with consumer success. It is a virtuous loop. As long as we focus everything we have on being of service and to people, connecting and feeling less alone in this world, we will be building a deeply meaningful business. We have already seen the people who are adopting IRL are doing so because they don’t want to use Facebook and no other product fits their core needs around groups, events, and communities. I have always believed that every excellent consumer company reflects and amplifies a part of humanity. And each product satisfies a specific and unique human need, impulse, or compulsion. Tiktok is for entertainment. Twitter caters to venting. Instagram is for showing off your lifestyle. Snapchat is for sharing moments. IRL is for your communities. The original, fundamental thing that makes us human is to be in community. Given this truth, it is incredible no single company is winning across the globe. This is our opportunity. To become the place for humans to organize and find their community. Big or small. Public or private. We see the impact we are making on our users and the thriving communities and conversations people have found in our product to date, and we are just getting started. A small handful of companies in the social space have made such an impact on people that they can consider themselves iconic and meaningful for decades to come. I fundamentally believe that if we are successful in our mission, we will cement ourselves as one of them as well. For us at IRL, it’s critical to deliver a measurable sense of progress in digital interactions and relationships so they don’t feel swift and superficial; or utterly repetitive and removed from real life. We can (and must) develop prompts, nudges, design in delight that makes people smile, and create an incredible product to improve the human experience online. Now, our mission is not for the faint of heart. There will be naysayers, critics, hackers, spammers, and so on. We will succeed as long as we focus on what we know and what we can control. Not just for us but our users worldwide. Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging. Like the Olympics, we know most people don’t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you. I have worked my entire life for a moment like this, and I am dedicated to putting every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears into making this a reality. Life is short, and I want to make the most of every moment. I am grateful that every day I get to wake up and obsess over helping others connect through community. I believe all of you feel this way, and I am so deeply honored to work alongside you all. I wish our former teammates the best on their journeys ahead. They are talented people, and I have no doubt they will thrive elsewhere. For those of us who remain at IRL, this is a new chapter for all of us to see what we are capable of.

Employees across product and people operations were impacted. The venture-backed company confirmed the layoff and number of people impacted, and provided the following statement from founder and CEO Joe Thomas: We’ve had to make the extremely difficult decision to move forward with a reduction in force across our team. Each person impacted was not only a talented employee, but also a valued individual and teammate. We’re committed to supporting these employees through this transition both in their offered severance as well as career support. We’re confident in the path ahead for Loom. This decision was ultimately made to ensure we’re able to move forward sustainably, especially in light of increased economic uncertainty, and continue to deliver on our vision for years to come. The company was founded by Thomas and Vinay Hiremath in 2015, hitting 1.8 million users across 50,000 businesses just three years later. Per its website, Loom currently boasts 14 million users across 200,000 companies including Netflix, Atlassian, HubSpot and Juniper Networks. https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people/ Similar to Hopin, Loom benefited from a surge of people working from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the product was positioned to help remote workers find better ways to connect with colleagues in a virtual-first world, and help hybrid workforces find a lightweight way to skip some meetings. Then, again similar to Hopin, the startup conducted layoffs to help it build in what it describes as a more sustainable way moving forward. That growth has attracted $203 million in known venture capital funding, with the company most recently announcing a Series C led by Andreessen Horowitz. The same round valued the company at $1.53 billion, making it hit unicorn status for the first time. Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Coatue and General Catalyst are also investors in the company. Over a year has gone by since the startup landed the new financing and valuation, and per today’s news, Loom joins the club of unicorns that have had to scale back workforces after landing the coveted milestone. Less than a year ago, visual creator tools startup Picsart raised $130 million from SoftBank, landing a valuation of over $1 billion. The company laid off 8% of its staff last month, affecting 90 people. Cameo, which also became a unicorn last year, also recently conducted layoffs that impacted 87 people.

        "Extracted Article": "Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup SWVL is planning to lay off 32% of its workforce it said in a statement today. The companys LinkedIn profile shows it has over 1,330 employees. Letting go of over 30% of its workforce means that around 400 people will lose their jobs at the mobility company. Tech companies, private and public, have faced a reckoning in the past few months with their valuations taking a beating. The effect of an economic downturn has also affected their finances leading them to cut costs; the top of the list is letting go of employees. This downsizing from the Dubai-based startup adds to the long list of global cross-stage layoffs in what has been a rough month for tech employees. Over 15,000 tech workers have lost their jobs in the U.S. alone according to reports. Companies such as Klarna, Getir, Gorillas and Bolt (the payments company) have dismissed portions of their workforce while the likes of Snap, Twitter and Instacart have slowed down hiring entirely. Its been a very busy 18 months for SWVL leading up to this news. This March, the company went public via a SPAC merger with U.S. women-led blank check company Queen’s Gambit Growth Capital. It listed at $10 per share and targeted a $1.5 billion valuation but has traded between $4 and $8 for the most part. Its current valuation hovers around $500-$600 million. All eyes are on Swvl as it starts trading on a SPAC combination The layoffs are coming just a month after SWVL acquired U.K.-based mass transit group Zeelo for $100 million according to sources. Its one of five acquisitions SWVL has made within the past year; others include Germany’s door2door, Turkey’s Voltlines (for ~$40 million), Spain’s Shotl and Argentina’s Viapool. SWVL said that though these acquisitions have contributed to its overall growth, it will need to make reductions on roles automated by investments in its engineering and product and support functions teams. The planned layoffs will impact teams responsible for functions that have been automated following investment in engineering, product and support functions, SWVL said in a statement. SWVL said it plans to attain profitability next year. Dismissing hundreds of employees is one way to get there. Others include developing its proprietary technology stack and growing its three models — where it makes $5 million in MRR — across existing and new markets, it said in a statement. SWVL is present in 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. According to a source, the majority of the layoffs will come from the company’s Dubai and Pakistan offices. Whether SWVL will continue its expansion into new markets such as Colombia, Mexico and South Africa, and the U.S. announced during its SPAC merger is uncertain. Swvl plans to provide monetary, non-monetary and job placement support to help transition certain of its employees to new roles, the company said in a statement on how it plans to support affected employees. As a result of the portfolio optimization program, Swvl’s management currently expects that the company will be cash-flow positive in 2023. CEO Mostafa Kandil sent out a letter to his employees addressing the layoffs. Heres a part of it: Become Free Cash Flow Profitable in 2023 Swvl is implementing a portfolio optimization program to focus on its highest profitability operations, enhance efficiency and reduce central costs Capitalizes on the highest profitability operations TaaS and SaaS which currently have &gt; 500 contracts in &gt; 10 countries generating &gt; $5m revenue per month B2C business is also expected to be contribution margin positive before the end of 2022 Builds on recent acquisitions of TaaS and SaaS businesses Viapool, Volt Lines, Shotl and pending acquisition of door2door which improve profitability margins Benefits from a world class engineering and product team and technology stack which allows for scalability and sustainable growth Resources No matter how big, resources are not infinite; cash is meant to be responsibly utilized. We need to be as disciplined as ever, which is why today, May 30, 2022, we announced that our portfolio optimization program to turn cash flow positive in 2023. As part of that program, we have considered various scenarios that will allow us to demonstrate how much we value our workforce. We believe that Swvl has reached such a level of success only because of the team, and we are also sure that Swvl will continue to get stronger. What we did: Voluntary salary deductions from the top management team Reduction of current office spaces Freezing our current hiring program Freezing travel and accommodation expenses Tying expenditures to essential business requirements People Effective today, May 30, 2022, we are optimizing our operations in some of our markets while reducing our workforce. The reduction follows an extensive evaluation of team redundancy and how this complements our strategy. We have arranged for one-to-one communications with all of the impacted teammates. Each member of the reduced workforce will receive an invitation to have a conversation with a relevant senior leader to receive clarity on the next steps based on each markets local laws, severance rules, and best practices. To those who will leave, I would like to say I am sorry. And more importantly, this is not your fault. You will forever be part of Swvl, and our door will always be open to you in the future. We are incredibly lucky and grateful to have worked with such remarkable talent that many companies would be fortunate to have. Besides your work, what will stay with us is knowing that we genuinely did hire people better than us. I am sure you will continue to have a significant impact wherever you go, as you have done day in and day out at Swvl. Easing the transition for impacted employees: Severance: All impacted employees to receive severance based on gross salary and complete cash payout Provident Fund, Gratuity &amp; Leave encashment other legal payments All RSU to be considered vested Expense claims/OPD claims to be cleared All Final Settlements to be taxed as per local requirement Payout Transfer to be complete in the next 21 days Medical Insurance: to be extended for all entitled employees Stock Options: all unvested stocks for impacted employees to continue to vest as per schedule Alumni Directory: an alumni network directory to support our impacted workforce No interview policy for Rejoiners Laptops to be retained by employees subject to data security requirements Update: In an email to TechCrunch, CFO Youssef Salem said Swvl is not shutting down operations in any country whether from its existing footprint or planned expansions but rather optimizing its network and headcount in each country. https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/heres-how-to-protect-your-equity-if-you-get-laid-off/ 10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully",

        "Extracted Article": "It continues to be a very rough week for e-commerce companies in Europe. In the latest development, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Getir the $12 billion quick commerce upstart that provides grocery essentials and sundries and promises delivery of them in minutes is cutting 14% of its staff globally. Its been estimated that the Turkish company employs some 32,000 people in the nine markets where it operates, which would work out to 4,480 people impacted by the downsizing. In addition to the headcount, the company plans to curtail a lot of its capital-intensive expansion which will include hiring, marketing investments and promotions. (Promotions in this context are not HR promotions, but the many discounts and free vouchers that quick commerce startups have been using to lure users to their platforms, at huge cost to the startups themselves.) According to a memo that we have seen which we are publishing below the cuts will vary by country. (One source in Berlin estimated that the cuts in that city alone will be around 400, although this is not a number Getir would confirm.) The company has confirmed that it will not be pulling out of any specific country as part of this. Getir currently operates in its home market of Turkey, as well as the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Portugal and the U.S. This is a stark swing of the pendulum for a company that raised $768 million at an $11.8 billion valuation just two months ago. But its not a surprise in the wider market context we are in at the moment, with tech companies big and small all seeing a downturn in their finances and valuations in the face of a wider cooling of the market. Just yesterday, one of Getirs big rivals in Europe, Gorillas, announced layoffs of 300 people and plans to explore strategic options, including sales or exits, in several European markets. Earlier in the week, Klarna the Swedish buy now, pay later company confirmed it would cut 10% of its workforce amid reports that it was seeking to raise money at a reduced valuation. The world of instant grocery delivery specifically has been one that many would argue was ripe for right-sizing for a while now. Founded seven years ago, Getir was an early mover in the instant grocery market, but the last couple of years has seen an explosion of the category. COVID-19 led to a change in consumer habits: In many cases stores were outright closed for periods of time, and people were less inclined to shop in person when they were open, and that led to a surge of people willing to try out shopping for groceries online for the first time. Many companies popped up, propped up by huge amounts of VC investment, to serve those consumers, and a sizable proportion of these startups were based on the premise of instant delivery, with items coming to your door within minutes of ordering, mimicking (or even reducing) the time it would take to quickly run to a physical store. Even before the capital markets collapsed earlier this year, several smaller startups either shut down or got acquired Getir being one of the consolidators, alongside other big players like Gopuff, Flink and Gorillas. Thats a trend that has continued into 2022, and there will likely be even more to come. Companies like Klarna and Getir may be coming from different corners of the world of commerce, but they share something in common: both are backed by Sequoia. The storied VC (which led Getirs Series C in 2021) just this week put together an alarm-bell presentation for portfolio companies, running through the state of the market today and some guidance on how to help weather the storm. The 50-slide presentation which a source shared with us covered topics like runway extension, fundraising in difficult markets, leadership in uncertain times and forecasting. Pointedly for a company like Getir which, similar to its rivals, has been raising hundreds of millions of dollars to pump into aggressive expansion strategies involving splashy ad campaigns, extensive operations infrastructure in urban areas and lots of promotions to bring on more consumers one slide was titled Growth at all costs is no longer being rewarded. The presentations message appears to have definitely hit home for Getir. The memo follows below. Well update this post as we learn more, and were sending our best wishes to those impacted by this news. Today is one of the most difficult days since we founded Getir, because we have to make tough decisions about our people organization that will adversely affect some of our team members. Rising inflation and the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook around the world pushes all companies, especially in the tech industry and including Getir, to adjust to the new climate. With a heavy heart, we today shared with our team the saddening and difficult decision to reduce the size of our global organization. At a global headquarter base, our reduction will be about 14%. Numbers will vary by country. We do not take these decisions lightly. We will do right by every person throughout this process in line with Getir’s values of being a good and fair company. We will also decrease spending on marketing investments, promotions, and expansion. There is no change in Getir’s plans to serve in the nine countries it operates. In these tough times, we are committed to leading the ultra-fast grocery delivery industry that we pioneered seven years ago.",

        "Extracted Article": "You thought the market was bad for venture capitalists, but what about the actual workers behind the tech companies they’ve backed? Reluctantly, we’re writing a tech layoffs roundup for the third week in a row, because once again, there have been reductions across stages and sectors. Over the past month, public and private tech companies have been announcing mass layoffs across sectors. Employees from Section4, Carvana, DataRobot, Mural, Robinhood, On Deck, Thrasio, MainStreet and Netflix have been impacted by the workforce reductions. Some bigger companies are instituting hiring freezes, such as Twitter and Meta, or announcing a shift in strategy, such as Uber. As has been our mantra while reporting on the layoffs sweeping the tech industry: layoffs don’t happen to companies, they happen to people. Especially for the U.S.-based tech employees, layoffs don’t just mean a loss of income they mean a medically dangerous loss of healthcare. Let’s take a look at which companies announced reductions this week. Netflix layoffs continue&nbsp; After layoffs hit Netflix’s content arm Tudum a few weeks ago, 150 more primarily U.S.-based employees were let go, plus 70 other employees in the animation division. A Netflix representative wrote in an emailed statement, “As we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company.” Netflix reported revenue of $7.87 billion for the first quarter of 2022 and a significant loss of 200,000 subscribers. Contractors were also impacted by these layoffs, but the number of affected workers in that designation is unclear. TechCrunch asked Netflix about reports that staff running diverse social channels like Strong Black Lead, Golden, Most and Con Todo were laid off, but Netflix said that the company decided not to renew contracts with certain agencies it used to recruit contractors. Still, it doesn’t feel great to see queer people and people of color losing their jobs, which helped Netflix cater to these audiences. Picsarts unicorn status didnt save it&nbsp; Less than a year ago, Picsart raised $130 million from SoftBank, putting the visual creator tools startup into unicorn territory with a valuation exceeding $1 billion. A leaner, hipper version of Adobe, things seem to have taken a downturn for Picsart, which laid off 8% of its staff this week, affecting 90 people. Other SoftBank-backed companies like Cameo, which also became a unicorn last year, just conducted layoffs. When Alex Wilhelm last covered Picsart, he noted that the company was expected to go public that still hasn’t happened, which may be a clue into what’s going on at the company to precipitate such cuts. India’s Cars24 cuts 600 jobs Cars24, a marketplace for used cars last valued at $3.3 billion by its venture capital investors, cut 600 jobs or 6% of its entire workforce this week. The Series G startup had just raised a $400 million round, making the reduction more about runway extension than lack of ability to pay the bills. As our own Manish Singh reports, Cars24 is one of many Indian startups that fired people in the last few weeks. Employees from Vedantu, Unacademy, Meesho, OkCredit, Trell, Furlenco and Lido have also cut several roles, he says. Marketplace startups, such as Cars24, feel especially vulnerable during a downturn. Consumer spending habits can get extremely fickle, which means that demand may decline while supply stays consistent or even grows. Balancing the two sides is the biggest art for any marketplace startup, but it becomes especially difficult to predict stability in revenue when everyone else has hit pause. Skillz scales back esports biz team&nbsp; Esports company Skillz laid off 70 employees, around 10% of the team, earlier this week, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. No executives were impacted by the cuts. “We decided to reorganize our resources and investments to increase our profitable growth and further deliver against our vision of building the competition layer of the internet,” the company said in an emailed statement. “This realignment resulted in changing some of our programs and consequently people on our team as we prioritize our resourcing levels to continue to offer a great player experience and enable more game developers to bring their creations to life.” The company’s statement is ironic; to better support its external community, it is cutting its internal community. The company says it plans to continue hiring in some areas of the business but did not mention which ones.",

        "Extracted Article": "Section4, an upskilling startup launched by prominent NYU professor Scott Galloway, has laid off a quarter of staff sources say. The layoffs, which occurred last week, affected employees across all levels of seniority and teams, but specifically targeted a majority of the product team. The startup first splashed onto the scene in 2019 with a goal to scale business school-quality courses in a more affordable, and entirely virtual, way. CEO Greg Shove confirmed layoff details to TechCrunch over email and said that 32 people were impacted. The executive declined to disclose specifics on what impacted employees were offered but said that the severance package was at market or better. Shove added that there is no hiring freeze and that the company will continue to employ folks in engineering and enterprise. Part of that hiring focus, he adds, is that the startup is moving faster in serving the enterprise than individual consumers, so hiring will reflect that. Sources back it up. They say that Section4 is having a full reorganization as a company because it is not hitting consumer growth numbers. In March 2022, Section4 hinted at potential underlying tensions with monetization: The company started offering unlimited courses for a single membership price rather than selling each course for $995. The startup last raised a $30 million Series A in March 2021. Per Shove, Section4 is aiming to serve 15,000 students and 200 enterprise customers by the end of the year. The company’s reasoning for the layoffs, per sources, largely came from financial mismanagement, not yet having product market fit and hiring too much. Per LinkedIn, Section4 has 142 employees that work there. Sources say that leadership also pointed out that its main product — two- to three-long week courses taught by prominent professors from top schools — was too costly to produce. Post-pandemic reset leads to wave of layoffs in tech Put differently, the startup’s initial goal was to create a more affordable way (think $700 per course versus $7,000) for managers to upskill themselves — and that is not working as planned. As of March 2021, the startup was hitting 70% completion rates and had taught 10,000 students. “Graduate education was transformative in my life, and I enjoy teaching, and we thought there was an opportunity — because of the pandemic and changing behaviors — to start an online ed concept that tried to deliver 50% to 70% of the value of an elite MBA elective at 10% of the cost and 1% of the friction,” Galloway previously told TechCrunch. Market shifts have rippled across tech in the past few weeks, as layoffs rocked unicorns and early-stage startups alike. Edtech, more specifically, enjoyed a capital injection during the early innings of the pandemic — and now, as consumer habits change, there’s a correction starting to play out. Last month, per the Economic Times, richly valued Indian edtech Unacademy laid off 1,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting measure. The same outlet reports that Vedantu, another edtech unicorn, cut 200 employees. Public edtech companies have also seen stock values slashed: Duolingo is currently trading at $65.58, down sharply from a 52-week high of $205; Coursera is trading at $13.89, also remarkably down from a high of $46.99. These cuts, along with Section4s layoffs, all signal that edtech isnt an exception when it comes to the Great Reset in tech. The Great Resignation, meet the Great Reset",

        "Extracted Article": "Carvana, a used-car retailer in the United States that raised at least nine figures worth of venture capital while private before going public, announced 2,500 layoffs today. The staffing cuts, detailed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are part of the companys previously announced plans to better align staffing and expense levels with sales volumes, Carvana wrote. Per the same filing, the company will offer impacted team members the opportunity to receive four weeks of pay plus an additional week for every year they have been with Carvana, along with the opportunity to receive extended healthcare, among other things. Carvana also said that its executive team is forgoing their salaries for the remainder of the year to help contribute to the severance pay for departing team members. That the company is cutting staff is not a surprise given its recent financial performance; the scale of the layoffs, however, is eye-catching. Lets talk about how Carvana got to this point. So much for the afterglow Carvana is a deeply unprofitable company, losing money in the first quarter even on an EBITDA basis, a heavily-adjusted profit metric. In numerical terms, Carvana had Q1 revenues of $3.497 billion, up 56% compared to its year-ago result. Despite its top-line gains, Carvanas gross profit fell to $298 million in the three-month period, leading to a net loss of $506 million, far worse than its $82 million net deficit in Q1 2021. The companys EBITDA margin also declined from -1.3% in the first quarter of 2021 to -11.6% in the first three months of 2022. How did Carvana wind up growing its revenues while shrinking its gross profit at the same time, thus boosting its losses? Heres how the company explained the matter in its earnings report: We generally prepare for sales volume 6-12 months in advance, meaning we built capacity in most of our business functions for significantly more volume than we fulfilled in Q1. With our costs relatively fixed in the short-term, the lower retail unit volume led to higher cost of goods sold per unit (e.g., reconditioning and inbound transport costs), leading to lower GPU, and higher SG&amp;A per unit. These effects combined with rapidly rising interest rates and widening credit spreads led to lower EBITDA margin. Carvana overbuilt for volume it didnt reach, leading to higher fixed costs and worse profitability. The issue led to the company writing in its Q1 2022 report that it intends to better align sales with expense levels through a combination of higher sales and expense efficiencies in the next several quarters. Given that timeline, more staffing cuts could be on deck. Its worth mentioning that the company had an entire section in its Q1 report detailing its expansion plans, noting that it had opened one new inspection and reconditioning center, or IRC, in Q4 2021 and three in Q1 2022, adding that it expected open three more this year. (That Carvana is buying another company using external debt is another matter.) In its SEC filing, Carvana said that [i]n connection with these right-sizing initiatives, over the next several weeks Carvana will be transitioning operations away from its Euclid, OH IRC and a few logistics hubs, making its April comments feel odd in retrospect. Still, the company has to make changes. It missed every single one of its long-term financial goals in Q1 2022: Image Credits: Carvana shareholder letter Even more, Carvanas operations consumed $593 million in cash during the first quarter, a huge sum for a company that reported cash and equivalents of $247 million at the end of Q1 2022. Carvanas cuts come as a number of startups also cut staff; companies of all shapes and sizes are reducing staff where they perhaps overhired or expected more demand than materialized. Its a tough time for business, in a sense, with a yet-tight labor market coupled with above-average inflation and uneven market performance. This wont be the last set of layoffs that we report on in the second quarter.",

Impact was felt across industries ranging from education to security, as well as stages from a post-Series A startup to a recently-SPACd business. Below, weve listed the latest companies that have laid off talent in response to the reset happening across startup land.

As weve been covering for months, consumer edtech has been flirting with selling to enterprises as to avoid revenue volatility (and land stickier contracts). Scott Galloway’s edtech startup, Section4, lays off a quarter of staff Carvana Carvana, the used-car retailer that went public in 2017, laid off 2,500 staff as part of the company’s “previously announced plans to better align staffing and expense levels with sales volumes,” it claims in a filing. Per the same filing, reports Alex Wilhelm, the company is offering those laid off four weeks of pay plus an additional week for every year theyve been at the company. The company claims that the executive team is forgoing their salaries for the remainder of the year to contribute to severance pay. The mobility meets e-commerce startup surged on Thursday, after earlier hitting a two-year low. I guess thats how the market responds to people losing jobs? A Short squeeze? Latch Latch, an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems, has been struggling for the past few months from experiencing a difficult SPAC debut to parting ways with its CFO, Garth Mitchell. Well, it looks like the business volatility has now trickled down to employees with the public company reportedly cutting 30 people, or 6% of its total staff, per an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch. DataRobot In 2019, DataRobot had just raised a $206 million Series E round from Sapphire Ventures, Tiger Global Management and a number of other firms. Then, just weeks after COVID-19 arrived in the U.S., the Boston-based machine learning company conducted layoffs due to uncertainty. Fast-forward to the present, DataRobot laid off another 7% of its workforce this week. With about 1,000 employees, these layoffs are estimated to affect around 70 people. In an email to staff obtained by The Information, CEO Dan Wright said that the layoffs were a response to changing market conditions after aggressive hiring last year (a trend we saw across layoffs last week). “That level of investment is no longer sustainable for our business, particularly in the context of broader changes in the market, with investors now taking a harder look at efficiency and spending,” he said in the email. Meta and Twitter freeze while Uber rethinks But wait, theres more On the heels of iffy Q1 earnings reports, some big tech companies are in trouble. Lets start with Meta née Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is all-in on building the metaverse, having just opened its first brick-and-mortar store. He also just demoed whats to come on the companys next headset, dubbed Project Cambria, which will incorporate mixed reality into the headset. But in Q1 alone, Meta’s Reality Labs its VR and AR team operated at a loss of $2.96 billion, and last year, Reality Labs lost over $10 billion. Meanwhile, Facebooks user growth has become relatively stagnant. Last week, Insider reported that Facebook CFO David Wehner wrote in an internal memo that hiring will be paused across most engineering teams for the rest of the year, citing an industry-wide downturn. Then, this week, Reuters reported that Meta is preparing cutbacks in Reality Labs, a bad omen for its burgeoning metaverse business. Some candidates for jobs at Meta have had their offers rescinded, per a viral LinkedIn post. Twitter employees are also facing a moment of uncertainty as they await Elon Musks impending takeover. Yesterday, CEO Parag Agrawal who is expected to be replaced after Musks acquisition clears asked two key executives to leave. The company is also undergoing a hiring freeze, which isnt uncommon following M&amp;A deals. “Effective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business-critical roles. We are also pulling back on non-labor costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,” a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. And then that brings us to Uber, which is valued lower now than it was in mid-2019. It’s clear that the market is experiencing a seismic shift and we need to react accordingly, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote. He added, We will treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount. We will be even more hardcore about costs across the board. Its not easy to navigate the pandemic as a company that requires drivers and passengers to sit together in a car. But, Khosrowshahis note highlighted investors interest in products like Uber Eats, which set their service apart from competitors like Lyft. Still, food delivery isnt the most profitable business either. Unfortunately, its usually the workers who get the short end of the stick in these situations, whether theyre tech staff or contracted gig workers. Khosrowshahi ended his note with an attempt at optimism (?) in a turbulent time. GO GET IT! he said. https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people/ Top Twitter execs, including heads of revenue and consumer products, are out following Musk deal",

Co-founders Erik Torenberg and David Booth did however confirm the layoffs in a blog post published after this story went live. As a community-centered company, our people have always been our highest priority. Our focus in the coming days will be on fully supporting our team – both those departing On Deck and those who will help us build the future, the post reads. On Deck, not to be confused with small business lender OnDeck, is a company that provides capital and network support for emerging fund managers and founders. Launched in June 2019, the company first announced a Founders Fellowship and has recently grown to offer more niche programs on specific verticals. In two years since launch, the company claims it has helped founders start over 1,000 companies and fill keep hiring roles. One of the startup’s newer programs is ODX, an accelerator program that offers a $125,000 check, program and network support, in exchange for 7% of a company. The program has backed 150 companies to date. Despite this alleged growth, sources close to the company say that ODX is likely going to be scaled back and potentially even shut down. On Deck was originally raising a fund between $100 million and $150 million from Tiger Global, a hedge fund that is breaking into the early-stage market. It appears that On Deck never closed that large of a fund and landed closer to $40 million. “Add into that missed sales targets on the revenue side of the biz and a ridiculous hiring sprint, they now have [nine] months of runway pre-cuts,” one of the sources said. The startup last raised known venture capital funding in March 2021, a $20 million Series A round led by Founders Fund. In an email obtained by TechCrunch, co-founders Erik Torenberg and David Booth addressed staff about the layoffs and the accelerator. In 2021, we launched ODX, our accelerator. We saw an opportunity to stand up and try our hand at innovating a stagnant accelerator market. By many accounts, we succeeded in this goal, the email reads. Unfortunately, over the same time period, the market began shifting dramatically. A few months in, the capital and accelerator markets were materially different from where they had been when we started. These factors forced us to reflect and consider how On Deck would continue for the future, support our communities and ensure long-term sustainability. The co-founders went on to say that they take full responsibility. not just for what brought us to this point, but also for making sure we do right by team members.

        "Extracted Article": "A day of reckoning has come for Thrasio, one of the bigger startups buying up and consolidating third-party Amazon sellers. TechCrunch has learned from sources that the company, valued last year at between $5 billion and $10 billion, is going to be laying off a portion of its employees this week. That news is coming at the same time that Thrasio is changing its leadership: today it announced that Greg Greeley, a former president of Airbnb and a longtime Amazon executive, is joining its board and taking on the role of CEO this August. He will be succeeding Carlos Cashman, one of the co-founders of the company, who will remain on Thrasio’s board as a director. The layoffs and new CEO appointment are the latest developments in a series of ups and downs for Thrasio in the last six months that underscore some of the challenges in the aggregator business model: – In April 2021, when Thrasio was announcing a $100 million raise, co-founder Josh Silberstein who at the time was co-CEO at the company with Cashman told TechCrunch that Thrasio was eyeing up a public listing to raise more money for expansion, either through a traditional IPO or via a SPAC; it was also appointing a new CFO to oversee the process. – The SPAC idea started to take shape over the summer, potentially valuing Thrasio as high as $10 billion. But then the new CFO left in July, just three months after joining; Silberstein subsequently left the company in September; and by the beginning of October, the SPAC option was delayed, reportedly due to problems that arose during a financial audit. – Yet by the end of that month, Thrasio announced another private fundraising, a whopping $1 billion deal led by Silver Lake, which was when it hit its $5-10 billion valuation. – Last week, people were sharing an email allegedly looking for investors in the company via a special purpose vehicle at a $2.7 billion valuation. Tellingly, the sender has gone silent (meaning: it may well be a hoax). The company declined to comment. Thrasio, the Amazon aggregator, raises $1B in fresh funding at a valuation of up to $10 billion Unfortunately, the layoffs are not a hoax. TechCrunch confirmed the rumors with the company, and we have also been shown an internal memo that explains how they will be carried out: people will be getting informed by their managers over the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). The company said in the memo that it “made the decision to reduce the size of the Thrasio team,” but it has not confirmed how many employees will be impacted. We understand that the layoffs will be part of a bigger reorganization. In that memo to employees, Cashman and Thrasio president Danny Boockvar write that in order to keep Thrasio on its trajectory, the company would need to make certain “strategic and operational changes.” “This is not an easy decision – especially within a culture like ours that is shaped around community and sharing,” they added. Employees being let go will receive “severance, healthcare, job support, and accelerated vesting of some of your options,” as well as career transition support and an alumni network for continued support, the memo mentioned. Their final working day will be May 13. Thrasio’s growth Thrasio was founded in 2018 by Cashman and Silberstein to capitalize on a very Amazon-like economy of scale: the Amazon Marketplace has millions of businesses and brands selling on it (nearly 2 million active sellers by one estimate) and there is a business to be built in bringing some of them together to run more efficient production, marketing and analytics, and fulfillment across them. The businesses would be picked up by Thrasio, which would invest in tech to run them better and more profitably as e-commerce operations, both on Amazon and potentially outside of it as well a new kind of Procter &amp; Gamble for the twenty-first century. It raised nearly $3.4 billion in funding to build out its business, acquiring hundreds of brands, with investors including the likes of Silver Lake, Advent International, Oaktree, Upper90, Harlan and more. When it raised its $1 billion round last October, it was buying businesses at a rate of 1.5 per week and had several hundred brands in its portfolio. Dozens of other aggregators followed in Thrasio’s wake some 150 according to Thrasio’s estimates, collectively raising some $15 billion in capital to fuel those ambitions eyeing up the same opportunity as Thrasio was chasing. Thrasio itself became a top-five seller on Amazon. Thrasio raises $100M for its Amazon roll-up play, appoints retail CFO for its next steps Where Thrasio is headed It’s not clear why a financial audit would have stalled Thrasio’s SPAC last year, but it speaks to some of the challenges of running a business and accounting for it when it’s evolving at a fast pace, and at its heart is about bringing multiple other businesses together. The concept of consolidating repetitive processes across multiple retailers sounds like a great idea in theory. “What happens when you get into that price range is that it gets hard to grow your business and manage it,” Silberstein told me last year, citing SEO, marketing and supply chain management as some of the challenges. “That means as you grow from $1 million to $10 million, the margins would decrease and it gets even harder to make returns. We simply observed the reality that all these great companies had reached a point between a lack of access to capital and simply not being able to keep doing what they do. We thought, if we acquire 10-20 of these we would have the scale to build best in breed supply chain, marketing and so on. We would fix the problem.” But in reality Thrasio has been building a business spanning a number of different consumer categories, geographies and demographics. Integrating even similar businesses can be costly and difficult (and it often goes wrong). And aggregators generally position themselves as solving those issues with tech, but in some cases, aggregators are not building as much technology as you might think: they are buying third-party tools to help with SEO, fulfillment and more. In that context, the move to bring in Greeley whose roles at Amazon included running its global Prime program suggests that the company wanted a more seasoned executive at the helm to keep its long-term strategy on the right path, especially given Greeley’s background and track record in the consumer marketplace space. Cashman has also been grappling with another controversy outside of Thrasio. He is facing a lawsuit being brought against him by Stacy Chang, an investor who left Founders Fund to join Cashman in a new venture capital firm called Arrowside Capital. She alleges he dismissed her after deciding not to move forward with the firm, and she is seeking damages, including for work she says she did over a six-month period. Thrasio also alludes to growing too big, too fast in the joint memo to employees. “Now, as we assess our strategy for the road ahead, we need to take the time to properly absorb and grow the businesses we have acquired, make sure we have rigorous processes and controls, and then look to re-scale our team in the optimal areas for growth.” They went on to say that some of that included “refining” its M&amp;A team to be able to handle acquisitions and integrate them into the company’s processes, as well as “undergoing our transformation in an environment with a pandemic, a war, a sharp rise in inflation, supply chain disruptions and changing consumer behaviors.” This is unlikely to be the final chapter for Thrasio, which remains the owner of hundreds of big-selling e-commerce brands. But the big question will be whether it continues as a single entity under Greeley, and whether it continues to grow as it has; or whether it takes a course to “rationalize” some of the many investments and acquisitions it has made over the years. “Just four years ago, the innovative team at Thrasio created an entirely new way for this community of entrepreneurs to achieve their business goals and see the reach of their products expand – and Thrasio continues to blaze the trail,” Greeley noted in a statement today. “Its been truly remarkable – and its still early in a marketplace with nearly $400 billion in total third-party sales in 2021 and trillions more in the broader retail ecosystem.” E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods",

        "Extracted Article": "Digital mortgage company Better.com has conducted its third mass layoff in less than five months, citing a declining mortgage market, according to an email to employees seen by TechCrunch. TechCrunch recently reported that the move was coming. It is unclear at the time of writing how many people were affected by the layoffs, but sources familiar with internal happenings at the company estimate that it ranges from 1,200 to 1,500, meaning that the company has effectively reduced its headcount from about 10,000 in December to less than 5,000 now. According to the subject line of the e-mail sent to all employees that went out at 8 a.m. EST today, the “U.S. Production Workforce” would be impacted. Sources familiar with the matter said Better Real Estate was among the impacted departments. The unit was at one time the “baby” of the company, sources say, and where a big chunk of investment dollars were going to go in 2022. Better had been vocal about its desire to build out its purchase experience and move beyond digital lending to help people find and purchase homes — hence changing its name from Better Mortgage to just Better. It was also working to expand value-added offerings like title and homeowner’s insurance as part of its product suite. Its refinance team is also believed to have been heavily impacted. In an email to employees, Richard Benson-Armer the company’s newly appointed chief people, performance and culture officer told employees that layoffs would occur today and affected employees would receive a “one-on-one” phone call from “leaders.” The companys CEO Vishal Garg infamously laid off 900 people, or 9% of its workforce, via Zoom in December. Better then laid off another 3,100 people on March 8. In that round, affected employees knew they were going to be laid off when they saw a severance check in their Workday accounts — the payroll software the company uses. In the email to employees, Benson-Armer said: Team, As you know, our team has been focused on ensuring that our business is nimble, able to weather industry headwinds and placed in the strongest position possible for the future by implementing operational changes, reducing costs and making the difficult but necessary decisions to reduce our workforce. As the mortgage environment in which we operate continues to indicate further declines ahead, we have to do more to ensure Better is appropriately positioned, financially and operationally, to navigate this changing environment. It is through this that we will continue to work to further position Better on its pathway to profitability. With this in mind, we have made the difficult decision to make another substantial cut to our production workforce in the United States. This is not the measure we wanted to take. But, this is both prudent and necessary for the health of our business. We continue to prioritize transparency and care as we go through this process, and our leaders will be spending today making one-on-one calls to notify departing colleagues of this news. If you are impacted, you will receive a call today to learn the news personally and discuss next steps. We are providing comprehensive severance packages encompassing compensation, healthcare coverage and access to outplacement services to all departing employees, who will receive: Compensation: A minimum of 60 working days – and as much as 80 working days – of cash severance payments Healthcare Coverage: Company healthcare benefits for those enrolled will remain effective until the end of the month (April 30, 2022) after which impacted employees will be able to opt into using COBRA, with Better covering the premiums until July 31 2022. Outplacement services: Access to dedicated, one-to-one assistance for resume and candidate branding services, career coaching, job concierge search and support services and personalized job and networking opportunities through Better’s partnership with Randstad RiseSmart, a global leader in career transition support. As we work to streamline our operations and strengthen our business in the face of these prevailing headwinds, we are also making changes to our footprint in select locations to achieve further cost savings. If this impacts you or your team, you will receive additional information about next steps of the transition in the coming weeks. Thank you for all of your hard work, care for our customers, and commitment to our purpose in these difficult times. Benson-Armer had been serving in the head people role since the departure of Alex D’Amico, who left in November, according to Inman. Notably, he is also a partner at Activant Capital, one of Better.com’s earliest investors as well as a former McKinsey consultant. TechCrunch reached out to Better.com for comment but had not heard back at the time of writing. Also at the time of writing, employees were still waiting to hear if they were among the impacted employees. Meanwhile, a list of people who have been laid off from Better is being compiled on Coda.

        "Extracted Article": "Austin unicorn Workrise has laid off an unspecified number of employees as it exits several verticals and seeks to divest parts of its business. The company, which has built a workforce management platform for the skilled trades, said that it was laying off employees but declined to say how many. Just last May, TechCrunch reported that the company had raised $300 million at a $2.9 billion valuation. At that time, Workrise currently had more than 600 employees in 25 offices. A user on anonymous community app for the workplace, Blind, said that the layoff affected 450 people but that number has not been confirmed with the company. You may know the startup better by its former name, RigUp. The company was founded in 2014 as a marketplace for on-demand services and skilled labor in the energy industry. It changed its name in early 2021 to reflect a new emphasis on industries other than just oil and gas after the industry took a beating in recent years. But it looks like the company is returning to its roots after a pandemic pivot didnt work out as planned. In a statement, Workrise spokesperson Dan Bank told TechCrunch: In recent months, Workrise has engaged on a go-forward strategy supporting skilled workers in the energy industry. In this pursuit, Workrise has decided to exit verticals that no longer align with its go-forward strategy. Unfortunately, many of our colleagues will be impacted as part of this restructuring and we have made the difficult decision to reduce headcount. This was done after careful deliberation and is a result of positions being eliminated, departments consolidated and an overall shift in growth priorities. This was not an easy process, but we believe this realignment is in the best interest of the company as we move forward helping skilled laborers grow their career in our core industries, including oil &amp; gas and renewables. In an internal email to employees obtained by TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Xuan Yong noted that the expansion into new markets beyond oil and gas was aimed at diversifying Workrise’s business and to support a broader range of skilled tradespeople. He added that the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated the company’s investment in those markets. He went on to say that since then, the company has decided it can “make the greatest impact” in energy. “With this in mind, we evaluated the rest of our portfolio and saw that some businesses were not the right complement, both from a financial and product perspective. The diverse range of businesses and workers we served created enormous complexity, which impeded us from effectively scaling and growing them. It was harder to deliver a worker-first product when we were spread across several industries with very specific needs. That is why we made the very difficult decision to exit certain verticals to focus on energy – oil &amp; gas and renewables,” Yong wrote. As a result, he said the company would “immediately right-size” parts of its business and divest from others. He added that Workrise has signed buyers for one of its businesses and is exploring sales for the rest. Yong also wrote: “In the immediate future, we will have less clients and workers to support. And the sad reality is we will have to reduce our corporate workforce to support our go-forward business. This wasn’t an easy decision, but it’s necessary for the future success of our company.” It’s not the first time the company has had to lay off workers. In 2020, Workrise laid off one-quarter of its corporate employees as the industry took a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, it appears that a pandemic pivot did not work out for the company. At the time of its last raise, the company told me that its gross revenue had tripled since 2018, going from just under $300 million to about $900 million to close out 2020. This article was updated post-publication to include an estimate of how many workers were affected Workrise, once known as RigUp, raises $300M at a $2.9B valuation",

        "Extracted Article": "Hopin, a virtual events platform often lauded for its rapid-scale growth amid the pandemic, has cut 138 full-time employees, or 12% of staff, as well as some contractors, according to multiple sources. A Hopin spokesperson, who confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, also confirmed that employees impacted by Hopin’s layoffs will receive three months of compensation, health benefits and their laptops. The company also removed the one-year cliff for stock vesting and is using RiseSmart, a recruitment agency, to help them with job hunting. Following unprecedented growth and several acquisitions, we are reorganizing to align with our goals for greater efficiency and sustainable growth,” the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. “It’s not easy to part ways with teammates, and we’re deeply grateful for the impact they’ve had while at Hopin.” According to a screenshot obtained by TechCrunch, Hopin CEO Johnny Boufarhat posted a statement in Hopin’s Slack about the reorganization. “We are committed to becoming more efficient while ensuring we have the required financial discipline and organizational rigor,” the co-founder wrote. He also pointed out that the layoffs were to “solve overlaps and duplications that crept into the business” following rapid growth and acquisitions. Notably, Hopin acquired five companies in just 2021, including a $250 million purchase of StreamYard. The statement strikes a different tone than merely 11 months prior, when Hopin closed a $400 million raise at a $5.65 billion valuation. Then Boufarhat told TechCrunch that “his company intends on being operationally IPO-ready next year.” The venture-backed startup amassed up to $1 billion in known venture capital over a two-year window, from top investors including Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Accel, Slack Fund, Coatue, Salesforce Ventures and others, per Crunchbase. Reporter Gergely Orosz, who broke news earlier today that layoffs were underway at the unicorn, noted in their piece that “Hopin’s biggest problem is how they were blindsided by demand during the pandemic and were unprepared for the post-COVID world.” It’s a similar story a startup loses discipline in pursuit of rapid growth to keep up with pandemic-amplified demand that we’ve seen ripple across other industries over the past weeks. Peloton has been perhaps the harshest signal of this easy come, easy go trend, this week cutting 2,800 jobs and removing its CEO John Foley from the helm of the company. The move comes after the fitness hardware company had to halt production of treadmill and bike products, due to slowing demand from consumers.

        "Extracted Article": "Ahead of today’s Peloton earnings report, John Foley announced that he is stepping down as CEO. The longtime chief executive will remain on as executive chair, with former Spotify CFO Barry McCarthy stepping into his old role. “Barry is an incredible leader who has held senior executive roles at Spotify and Netflix and is a longtime advisor and board member at public and private technology companies,” Foley said in an open letter. “This appointment is the culmination of a months-long succession plan that I’ve been working on with our Board of Directors, and we are thrilled to have found in Barry the perfect leader for the next chapter of Peloton. I look forward to working with him and invite you to welcome him with open arms.” The firm is also cutting 2,800 jobs globally, around 20% of its corporate workforce. Cuts will come “at every level of the organization.” Such moves arrive at the tail end of a roller-coaster couple of years for the connected fitness brand, culminating with a drop in demand. In addition to Foley, Peloton’s president of five years, William Lynch, will be transitioning to a nonexecutive director role on the company’s board. Foley also notes that his wife, Jill Foley who has served as VP of Apparel at the brand will be transitioning away from the role. “She founded and built our incredible Apparel business from the ground up,” Foley wrote. “We are all very proud and grateful to Jill and the team that has helped her develop that sector of our business into what it is today.” Shareholders were convinced some dramatic changes were necessary for the company, which was riding high not long ago amid a surge of pandemic-fueled demand. The brand had a good deal of wind in its sails prior to COVID-related shutdowns, amassing an almost cult-like following, but the widespread closure of gyms proved a massive accelerator. After an initial bottleneck in supply, the company invested $400 million in U.S. production back in May 2021. This year, meanwhile, has thus far been marked by reports of slowed demand and corrective action. Peloton hired consulting firm McKinsey as its examined layoffs. Soon after, the company reportedly halted all production of its treadmill and bike products. Foley broke from pre-earning silence to confirm the former and deny the latter, stating at the time: [W]e’ve found ourselves in the middle of a once-in-a-hundred year event with the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we anticipated would happen over the course of three years happened in months during 2020, and into 2021. We worked quickly and diligently to meet the demand head-on at a time when the world really needed us, in large part thanks to how hard you worked every day. We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth. In January, investment firm Blackwells Capital called on the board to terminate Foley and investigate a Peloton sale, noting: “Remarkably, the Company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders. And no wonder, the latter, given that Peloton underperformed every other company in the Nasdaq 100 over the last twelve months.” More recently, Peloton has reportedly been courting potential acquisitions from companies including Amazon. “We are open to exploring any opportunity that could create value for Peloton shareholders,” Foley said at the time, addressing those rumors. As The Wall Street Journal noted, the rapid appointment of a new CEO could point to a company not quite ready to sell at least not in its current state. In his letter today, Foley addressed the ongoing changes and challenges in the wake of the pandemic. For many of us, the last two years have been a whirlwind of a learning experience. We navigated COVID-19 together, did our best to meet unprecedented demand, increased the size of our team, and grew our product portfolio. But with this growth, we have also faced our fair share of challenges / pivots / the unexpected. We often had to act quickly, with limited visibility. For example, in the face of supply chain disruptions and delivery delays, we invested heavily in near-term capacity, inventories, and logistics to protect our Member experience. However, as our post-COVID demand picture looks different than anticipated, these investments no longer align with how we intend to operate our business going forward. Along with the layoffs, Peloton is also abandoning the U.S. manufacturing plans Lynch announced last May, instead relying on third parties, as well as Tonic, a bike manufacturer it acquired in 2019. The company will also be significantly reducing its first-party warehouse and delivery operations. “Were also taking a clear-eyed look at our culture and, if were honest with ourselves, we see some things that need to change,” Foley wrote. “One of these things is optimizing processes for making decisions which includes creating more space for debate to get to the right decisions, empowering the right folks to be decision-makers, and supporting decisions once made so we can enhance our execution. You can expect this to be a priority for Barry and our leadership team in the coming year.” The company has also announced plans to establish profitability and sustainable free cash flow, according to a press release: Once these actions are fully implemented, the company expects to achieve at least $800 million of annual run-rate cost savings through operating expense efficiencies and significant margin improvement in its Connected Fitness category. The company will also reduce its planned capital expenditures in 2022 by approximately $150 million. The restructuring program is expected to result in approximately $130 million in cash charges related to severance as well as other exit and restructuring activities and $80 million in non-cash charges. The majority of the charges will be recorded in fiscal year 2022. Foley and the company promised to answer more questions during today’s earnings call.",

        "Extracted Article": "Glossier, the popular beauty brand led by former blogger Emily Weiss, let go of 80 of its corporate employees today, according to an internal email obtained by Modern Retail. The cuts, which amount to around one-third of Glossier’s corporate workforce, will primarily impact the company’s technology team. “[W]e are shifting our technology strategy to leverage external partners for parts of our platform that we’re currently maintaining internally,” Weiss wrote in the email announcing the layoffs to staff. The email recounts some of the company’s recent mistakes, including prioritizing strategic projects that “distracted” the company from its core beauty business and that executives “got ahead of ourselves on hiring.” The tech team layoffs are notable for a beauty retailer that has often described itself as a technology company. In numerous interviews throughout the past two years, Weiss and other executives have emphasized the company’s focus on its direct-to-consumer online shipping model and obsession with iterating the customer experience based on feedback. The company built its own point-of-sale system and commerce APIs in-house, allowing them to deliver a seamless customer experience, former Glossier CTO Bryan Mahoney said in 2018. Founded in 2014, Glossier is widely touted as one of the earliest breakout successes of the DTC model, and raised its Series E last July at a $1.8 billion valuation from Lone Pine Capital, Sequoia, Forerunner Ventures and others. E-commerce sales typically account for 80% of Glossier’s revenue, the Business of Fashion reported last July. Despite its fundraising success, Glossier’s ascent has oftentimes been far from smooth. The company laid off its entire retail staff and closed all its physical locations, including its flagship New York City store, in August 2020. It also grappled with the fallout from an open letter written by some of its employees of color sharing their experiences of enduring racism from managers in its stores, prompting a public apology from Weiss. Nearly a year later, the company seemed to change course on its decision to double down on e-commerce alone, saying it planned to use the Series E funding to open three new permanent physical stores in Seattle, Los Angeles and London as well as reopen its New York City location. It hoped to use the retail locations to build brand awareness and encourage customers to create content, areas Glossier became well-known for in its early days through its distinctive, millennial-pink aesthetic and clever use of social media marketing. The company’s website currently says customers should “stay tuned” for more retail store openings this year. Current and former Glossier employees can contact Anita Ramaswamy by e-mail at aramaswamy.techcrunch@gmail.com or on Signal, a secure encrypted messaging app, at 480 463 4056. It may not be as glamorous as D2C, but beauty tech is big money",

It became clear that there were several team-level changes needed to make sure we have the right people in the right roles and locations to execute against our plans.It's not easy to make all these changes at once, but it's even harder to have them roll out gradually throughout the year, and so we asked leaders to do all they could to pull these decisions forward. As a result, about 300 Stripes, largely in product, engineering, and operations roles, are departing today.[0] All those who are impacted have already been informed, and everyone will receive a severance package, including their earned annual bonus.I want to be clear that we're not slowing down hiring — we expect to grow headcount across all our locations and to land at about 10,000 Stripes by the end of the year (a 17% Y/Y increase). Our business performance continues to be strong.Our confidence that this is the right business decision doesn't make it easier for those who are leaving or those losing valued teammates. I appreciate everyone's resilience and want to thank those departing for their contributions and for building with us.Rob[0] There are local processes commencing for some Stripes outside the US, in accordance with country-specific employment practices.Are you a Stripe employee with insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Sword Health cut a portion of its physical therapists last month, the company confirmed to BI.The startup aims to use AI to help increase the number of patients its physical therapists care for.Sword, which hit a $3 billion valuation earlier this year, could go public as soon as 2025.Sword Health has made cuts to its clinical workforce as the $3 billion startup seeks to manage more patients with the help of AI, Business Insider has learned. Last month, the startup, which provides virtual care for conditions such as muscle and joint pain, let go of 13 of its physical therapists who were treating patients, Sword confirmed to Business Insider.Three former employees who spoke with BI on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said Sword previously had about 75 physical therapists actively caring for patients, which puts the October cuts at about 17% of Sword's treatment-facing clinicians. The layoffs come as Sword seeks to use AI to enable its physical therapists to treat more patients. Sword aims to have its physical therapists manage an average of 700 patients at any given time by the end of 2024, according to documents reviewed by BI.That's a significant jump from the caseload previously allotted to Sword's clinicians, the three former employees said, adding that a high caseload at the beginning of 2024 would've been about 200 to 300 patients per therapist. These numbers could include patients who aren't actively engaged in therapy, according to the company.In a statement to BI, a Sword spokesperson said the cuts were \"all performance-based decisions, made on clinical engagement data.\" The spokesperson said Sword has open positions for more than 30 physical therapists. Sword, which hit a $3 billion valuation in June after pulling in $130 million in fresh financing, has been vocal about its ambitions to scale its business using artificial intelligence while keeping clinicians in the loop.\"What we're looking to do internally is to have AI as one master expert, but at the same time, everything gets vetted and validated by a human person,\" Sword CEO Virgílio Bento told BI in September 2023.The three former employees said that Sword began using AI-generated messages for patient conversations in the spring. The technology allows physical therapists to accept an AI-generated message, edit it, or reject it. Once a therapist accepts or edits the message, it's sent to patients, the former employees said. The AI also helps physical therapists prioritize the most critical patients, who might need more attention, according to the company. Following its $130 million financing round, Sword announced an expansion of its AI platform with a new product that the company said could converse with patients during their virtual physical-therapy sessions and give them feedback in real time.It's also hoping to land more employer contracts with an outcomes-based pricing model, unveiled in September. In those contracts, Sword is set to get paid based on how much progress its patients make.Sword's recent technology and pricing pushes also point to an approaching initial public offering. Bento told BI in 2023 that he'd be interested in taking Sword public only if it's profitable. The startup said in June that it expected to be profitable by the end of 2024 and could go public as soon as the second half of 2025. It's not the only digital-health startup waiting at the IPO gates. Its biggest competitor, the musculoskeletal startup Hinge Health, has hired banks, including Morgan Stanley, to file its S-1 in anticipation of a public-market debut, Business Insider first reported in September.Omada Health is also expected to test the IPO waters. BI first reported last month that Omada filed its S-1 this summer.",

These people asked to remain anonymous to protect business relationships. A spokesperson for PubMatic confirmed the move, saying it impacted a dozen people or about 1% of the workforce.The company stated in its financial filings that it had 948 employees, 290 of whom were located in the US, as of December 21, 2023. \"PubMatic is optimizing operations to focus on high-growth areas such as supply path optimization, CTV, and commerce media,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"By streamlining and enhancing collaboration under consolidated leadership, we will foster innovation, reduce complexity, and maintain our commitment to growth and operational excellence.\"The spokesperson added that the company had more than 50 open positions it is actively hiring for and that it plans to grow its overall head count by around 15% this year.Founded in 2006, California-based PubMatic operates what's known in the advertising industry as a supply-side platform, which helps publishers organize and sell their ad inventory in online ad auctions. It has since expanded its offering into areas like video, connected TV, retail media, and supply path optimization, which helps advertisers streamline the buying process by forming direct relationships with publishers and cutting out intermediaries.The company went public 2020 and had a market capitalization at the time of writing of about $730 million.PubMatic's stock took a dive when the company reported its most recent quarterly earnings in August. While revenue grew 6% and gross profit grew 10% year-over-year, the company revised down its full-year revenue guidance after one of its demand-side platform partners, in May, changed the way it bid on advertising auctions. AdExchanger later reported the DSP was Google's DV360. PubMatic also said in August that its outlook assumed \"continued softness from certain ad verticals,\" which included sectors such as technology, automotive, travel, and entertainment. However, the company's chief financial officer, Steve Pantelick, described the weakness as an \"air pocket\" that wouldn't significantly impact the remainder of the year.The company's stock price is down around 8% year to date.",

That means it's moving away from wellness, home, travel, and sexual wellness, some of which are&nbsp;categories that once defined the brand.Goop started out as a newsletter of Paltrow's favorite things before becoming a website and then a mini-empire.Ten years into its run, in 2018, it raised $50 million in a Series C round;&nbsp;it has raised a total of $134.5 million and was last valued at $433 million in 2020, per PitchBook. At the time, it was largely a media and e-commerce company, shilling alternative health products like jade vaginal eggs as well as its own line of supplements, signing deals with media giants like Condé Nast, and hosting summits that could cost thousands of dollars to attend. Throughout its many iterations, it also had a Netflix series, a line of home goods, and its own publishing imprint.Recently, it has doubled down on beauty and food.Over the summer, Goop opened its first store to offer in-store treatments. Last year, it launched Good Clean Goop, a lower-priced line of skincare that can be found in Target and on Amazon. (An exfoliator from the brand costs $20, while one from Goop Beauty costs $125.) Puck reported in June that the lower-priced line was in the \"'bottom 15' at Target.\" Neil Saunders, a managing director at GlobalDatal Retail, told Business Insider that while being in Target had increased the brand's exposure, \"more needs to be done by Goop to really cut through, especially with younger consumers.\"Goop Kitchen — a ghost kitchen, or delivery-only restaurant — was founded in 2021. It has several locations in Southern California and recently raised $15 million from investors like Travis Kalanick, the Uber cofounder and CloudKitchens CEO, at a $105 million valuation, according to PitchBook.Goop's many pivots have not been without internal turmoil. In 2021, BI reported that at least 140 employees, including executives, had left the company over two years, with some saying they felt underpaid. \"Leadership training is where I'd be spending all my time,\" a former employee told BI at the time. \"Sometimes, when you have founders who are also CEOs, that passion can be a blind spot.\"While the brand has had three CEOs since its inception, Paltrow has been its chief executive since 2017.The brand told WWD that its revenue was up last year over 2022 and was on track to increase again this year, though it didn't provide any numbers. Goop did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Do you work for Goop or have a tip about the company?

The startup, founded by Kel Rakowski and Jennifer Rhiannon Lewis in 2019, was originally launched as a dating app for LGBTQ+ users and was inspired by magazine-era personal dating ads. The app pivoted to more community-focused features last year and Lewis replaced Rakowski as CEO.\"We're committed to building Lex to be a thriving social app for LGBTQ+ community,\" Lewis said in a written statement. \"It's an invaluable tool used by 1 million people to date to express their full queer identity, safe from harassment of mainstream social, cultivate connections with local gays in their neighborhood and find queer resources.\" Lex had raised a total of $7 million in funding, the company told Business Insider earlier this year. The full-time team was about eight staffers, according to a comment on the platform's Instagram account.Like many other newer social-media platforms, Lex has been experimenting with ways to monetize its product. The app offers premium features — such as changing your location or the ability to post several times a month — that users can unlock with one-time purchases. It also has a program for queer-owned businesses to advertise on its platform.In June, Lex announced its \"Team Gay Agenda\" campaign to raise funds from its users via recurring monthly pledges and told users that the \"Lex community is at risk.\" The layoffs occurred at the end of June.\"With the well documented demise of queer spaces, our number one priority will always be making sure our community has space to thrive on Lex,\" Lewis added. \"The layoffs allow us to explore more possibilities to achieve that vision. We're currently in active conversations with other parties who share our commitment to accelerate this community's growth.\"The platform is not shutting down and two laid-off staffers told BI that they hope to see the platform survive. \"I believe in the app,\" said one laid-off staffer who requested anonymity to protect career prospects.The queer community is growing, but new social apps face an uphill climbLex services a small but growing community: A Gallup poll found that in 2012, just 3.5% of Americans considered themselves non-heterosexual; in 2020 — just after the time of Lex's founding — that figure grew to 5.6%. And, as of 2023, 7.6% of Americans identified as non-heterosexual. That increase has been driven by younger generations — including over a fifth of Gen Z — identifying as LGBTQ+.Business Insider's analysis of individual-level Household Pulse Survey data from April 2024 found that just around a third of gay and lesbian adults are married, compared to 58% of straight adults — another potential boon for dating-based platforms. Queer adults might also wield some significant spending power. But it can still be difficult for new social apps to sustain themselves after initial interest bursts. For instance, BeReal, which was recently sold, has seen a decline in active users since its viral moment in 2022, according to recent estimates from Sensor Tower. It also recently laid off staff following its sale.\"We're so grateful for how far we've come from one little Instagram account, and we couldn't have done that without you all,\" Lex wrote in its \"Team Gay Agenda\" campaign letter. \"The future is queer, and the future has Lex in it.\"",

Leadership of Voodoo on Tuesday conducted an all-hands meeting with BeReal staffers, informing them of plans to layoff a significant portion of BeReal's workforce, according to two people familiar with the meeting.The move comes about two weeks after Voodoo said it was acquiring BeReal in a deal comprised of stock and some cash and replacing its co-founder and CEO, Alexis Barreyat. BI previously reported that BeReal was set to be acquired. The venture-backed start-up was set to run out of funding later this year and was having trouble garnering interest in a Series C.A spokesman for Voodoo and BeReal declined to comment.In a June interview with BI, Alexandre Yazdi, the CEO of Voodoo did not deny that BeReal would be hit with post-acquisition layoffs. Instead, he said the company wanted to \"keep all the good talent, the ones that are willing to work with us the way we want to work, the ones that are adapted to our culture and our strategy.\" Yazdi added that he intended to implement a \"sustainable business model\" as quickly as possible.BeReal launched in 2020 and skyrocketed in popularity during the pandemic, hailed as an \"anti-Instagram\" that prompted users once a day to take a picture of whatever they were doing within a two-minute window. Since then, the app has struggled to grow its user base, stalling around 25 million per day, according to internal figures, as BI reported previously.The startup raised $90 million in funding from venture capital heavyweights such as DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, and Accel. At its peak in May 2022, it was valued at around $600 million.",

Employees working across several Cloud teams were informed that their jobs were being eliminated, according to an internal document reviewed by Business Insider and an employee familiar with the matter, whose identity BI confirmed and who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.The total number of affected staff could not be learned, although the cuts appear to have hit Google Cloud's \"Go To Market\" teams the hardest. One employee said it was rumored that close to 100 employees in Cloud's GTM group in the Asia-Pacific region were cut. A Google spokesperson said that number was lower. Teams focused on consulting, partner engineering, and sustainability were among those affected by layoffs, according to the document.The document noted that some recent hires were laid off, including at least one new recruit who had yet to complete their onboarding process. Some affected employees have been offered time to find new roles within the company.\"As we've shared before, we continue to evolve our business to meet our customers' priorities and the significant opportunity ahead,\" a Google spokesperson told BI in a statement. \"We maintain our commitment to investing in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.\" Layoffs have become the norm inside the search giant, which has been eliminating jobs all year and moving some roles to other locations. This week's Cloud layoffs appear to be more sweeping than Google's more surgical cuts to other teams in recent months.Google cut a \"small number\" of roles in its global affairs earlier this month, according to a copy of an email sent by Google's global affairs chief Kent Walker that was reviewed by BI.

        "Extracted Article": "ComplYant was a tax-compliance startup that raised over $10 million in venture funding.The company abruptly shut down last year, and it took almost two months for employees to be paid.The founder and CEO cut off communication, deleting her accounts on LinkedIn, Instagram, and X.On a Friday morning in September, dozens of employees at ComplYant, a Los Angeles-based tax-compliance startup, logged on to Slack to watch a video their bleary-eyed CEO had recorded in the middle of the night. \"I'm coming to you all with some very unfortunate news,\" the CEO, Shiloh Johnson, said in the video, a copy of which Business Insider obtained. \"I know this comes as a deep shock to everyone, but the company is actually going through a wind-down process, and as a result we were ordered to furlough every employee immediately.\"Johnson told employees not to talk to anyone outside the company. She promised they'd soon get their final paycheck and any severance she could offer. It took nearly two months for all employees to be paid, and they never received any severance.\"We were all left between a rock and a hard place to make sure our mortgages were paid and we could pay the heating bill for our families,\" said Benjamin Matthews, ComplYant's former engineering manager. \"We are still not sure if we were paid everything we were owed.\"ComplYant, which raised over $10 million in venture funding, is hardly alone in its struggles. It was just one of over 3,000 startups that closed their doors last year, according to PitchBook. As venture funding has dried up, investors have been warning of a \"mass extinction event\" for startups. Still, amid the sea of startups closing, ComplYant's sudden demise has been a much-discussed topic in the tight-knit Los Angeles venture community.The speed with which the firm closed was striking. Even the human-resources firm retained to help employees with offboarding, Tandem, quit soon after the layoffs because it never got paid.Shannon Flynn Bevers, Tandem's president and founder, said that she tried to help employees but that Johnson stopped responding. \"In my career, I've never had that happen before,\" Flynn Bevers said. \"When startups go out of business, they will pay employees their final paycheck. They may not be able to give them severance, but the CEO is usually around to provide answers.\"The closure also offers a window into the toll of startup failure on the founder. Venture capitalists have predicted that startup founders will face an unprecedented mental-health crisis this year as an increasing number confront the cold reality of shuttering their firms.Making matters worse, many founders suffer in silence because they have been conditioned not to show weakness to their employees or investors. \"The majority of VCs don't want to hear about a founder's mental health,\" Josh Felser, an early-stage investor, previously told BI, speaking about startups in general. \"It's like, don't ask, don't tell.\"While employees were still trying to get their paychecks two weeks after the layoff, Johnson abruptly cut off communication. She deleted her accounts on LinkedIn, Instagram, and X after saying she was admitted to the hospital for major depressive disorder.\"This has been the hardest thing I have ever had to go through in my life and I am not handling it well,\" Johnson wrote in an email, viewed by BI, on October 4, right before she went silent. Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. BI interviewed eight former employees for this story; some requested anonymity because they were worried that speaking out could harm their job prospects. BI also reviewed emails, Slack messages, and other internal documents to better understand what happened.Despite their frustration at how things ended up, those who worked with Johnson say they mostly feel sympathy for her and miss working at a startup where they strongly believed in the mission.\"I hate this whole thing because I really, really like Shiloh,\" said Aerin Paulo, ComplYant's former head of marketing. \"She was the best boss I'd ever had. She was kind, considerate, and supportive.\" A seed round led by Craft Ventures and a tech success storyAfter working for nearly two decades as a certified public accountant, Johnson founded ComplYant in 2019. She said she was tired of saving large companies millions of dollars in tax bills while getting little in return. Her goal was to help small businesses navigate the labyrinth of tax regulations from state to state.\"At that point I was like, I'm pretty sure I can do this on my own and make way more money,\" Johnson told a podcaster last year. She added, \"I just wanted to be able to help people, and I wanted to be able to be the master of my own domain.\"Johnson invested $50,000 of her own money. She said the company was generating $28,000 in monthly recurring revenue just eight months after launching. ComplYant later raised a pre-seed round from Mucker Capital and Slauson &amp; Co., two LA early-stage venture firms. In 2021, it was accepted into the Techstars LA accelerator. ComplYant's 2022 seed-round fundraising deck. ComplYant The next year, ComplYant closed a $5.5 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, the top-tier San Francisco venture firm cofounded by the investor and podcaster David Sacks.\"Shiloh is a domain expert with a keen product sense on a mission to empower all types of business owners with fiscal guidance,\" Michael Tam, a partner at Craft Ventures, said in a press release at the time. \"This is the strong combination we look for as investors and we found it in spades with ComplYant.\" (Tam, who joined ComplYant's board, and other investors — Mucker Capital, Slauson &amp; Co., and Fika Ventures — declined to comment for this story.) As a rare Black female CEO in tech, Johnson represented a welcome success story in an industry overwhelmingly dominated by white men. She was featured on BI's list of 71 Black women who had raised $1 million or more in VC funding since 2021.ComplYant went on a spending spree starting in 2022, growing its head count to over 50 employees and flying them to Colorado for a team-building retreat at the end of July 2023, two months before the company shut down.Employees — many of whom were meeting for the first time because the company was fully remote — kayaked, cycled, did arts and crafts, and took new headshots. At night they ate a steak dinner and roasted s'mores by the fire. \"I've worked at other startups and never gone to something that nice,\" a former manager said. Several other former employees said they found the retreat excessive for a seed-stage startup.Johnson hosted a question-and-answer session and presented a rosy picture of the company's future. In various presentations last year, she mentioned the company had over $5 million in the bank and was raising a Series A funding round.\"It did not appear as if we were facing anything dire by any stretch of the imagination,\" Matthews said. But beneath the surface were significant problems.For one thing, former employees say ComplYant never developed a product-market fit. Its features, like helping businesses manually file tax extensions, were decidedly low-tech.Even though its services started at just $9.99 a month, ComplYant never had more than 50 paying users, according to former employees. \"The value that we offered for our customers was just not there,\" one of the employees said. \"We had a few things that people would pay for, but a lot of it was just around providing tax information in a calendar format.\"A few weeks after the Colorado retreat, the company missed its payroll, according to Slack messages seen by BI.\"Because she was telling us that there were millions of dollars in the bank account, we felt like we were pretty good,\" said Ryan Cady, a former software engineer at ComplYant. \"My interpretation now is that money just wasn't there when those paychecks didn't come through.\" Johnson told employees to take a weeklong furlough and blamed the issue on a technical snafu.\"I know I'm making a million and one mistakes but I'm learning as I hope we all are,\" Johnson wrote in a companywide Slack message after the furlough. \"It'll make for one hell of a book when we exit!\"This was not the first time payday came late, multiple employees said. \"There were quite a few missed payrolls,\" said Lusely Martinez, the company's former senior technical recruiter. \"That was one of the biggest warning signs.\"On September 19, a manager received an ominous message after a payment for one of the company's vendors was declined: \"All corporate credit cards for this company are locked.\"Four days later, it was supposed to be payday. Martinez logged on to her computer from her home office in New York. \"I had all these bills to pay, and so I was waiting for my direct deposit to come through,\" Martinez said. \"No one's payroll had gone through at that point, and we were all trying to figure out what had happened.\"A short time later, Johnson posted her video announcing it would be ComplYant's final day.Employees reacted on Slack with a range of emojis – grief, frustration, anxiety, chaos, and a dumpster fire. \"To be honest, I had kind of expected something like that to happen at some point,\" Cady said, \"but it came sooner than I anticipated.\"Nearly 2 months of waiting for a paycheckOn October 4, nearly two weeks after the layoffs, Johnson reiterated that paychecks were coming.\"I owe you all a little over $598k, to which I have access to about $250k, which I also have to pay vendors with as well,\" Johnson wrote. \"My plan is to liquidate equity on my house, which I am doing now to make up the difference.\" She also told employees they could file a claim with their state labor department or hire an employment lawyer.\"But contacting investors does not help get anyone paid sooner; it actually slows things down,\" Johnson said. \"This is not what I had planned and not how I wanted things to go, and unfortunately, you all are casualties in the fallout, but I WILL make it right.\"It ended up being another seven weeks before all employees were finally paid. Johnson had cut off all communication, and the HR company, Tandem, had stopped assisting employees after it wasn't paid either.Johnson's daughter, Taliah McGuire, formerly her executive assistant, sent a final email on November 20. (She did not respond to messages seeking comment and deleted her LinkedIn profile.)\"My only job was to help my mother get the owed money out, and now that I have, I no longer play a part in this situation,\" McGuire wrote. \"I will be deactivating this info email. I am unaware of what's going on with severance, but I am now assuming it probably won't happen due to the lack of money.\" McGuire added that her mother was pregnant.\"She is still struggling mentally with the loss of her company,\" McGuire wrote. \"This was very emotionally draining, and we have our finances to figure out the same way you all do.\"This year, Johnson, who was married last year and now goes by Shiloh Luckey, reemerged on TikTok, where she answers questions about taxes. Her account doesn't mention ComplYant; her bio simply says, \"Long time CPA.\"Money is still missingFormer employees were relieved to finally get the three weeks of pay they were owed, but they say some money is still missing.One former employee said she never received over $2,000 in expenses she was owed, while several former employees said they discovered their final 401(k) contributions never reached their retirement accounts. In a March email, seen by BI, a customer-service representative from the company's 401(k) provider, Penelope, told a former employee, \"The 401(k) contributions from your previous employer did not clear.\"The former employee wrote back that his former colleagues were considering their legal options, though he later said in an ex-employee Discord channel that it probably wasn't worth pursuing.\"We've likely got very little feasible recourse to recoup that money,\" he wrote. \"It was looking promising for a bit but in the end just another jab for us all.\" Making matters worse, because they were wired a lump sum of their final net pay and got no pay stub, former employees still don't know what happened to withheld taxes.\"We don't know what was given to the government as far as our salaries and what moneys were actually sent and were not sent,\" Matthews said, adding that he and his former colleagues found this all the more vexing given that the company's mission was helping small businesses streamline tax compliance.\"The irony is not lost on any of us,\" Matthews said.",

Grin is a platform that helps brands access influencers for marketing campaigns and provides other creator tools. The company has raised a total of $145 million to date, per Crunchbase data, and was founded in 2014 by Brandon Brown, a former marketing manager at Red Bull.As the company grew, \"a distance also grew\" between the platform and its customers, the Grin spokesperson said in a statement. \"We need to close this gap and put the customer back at the center of how we work,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is no secret that the ongoing changes in the global economic environment have impacted many brilliant companies in the tech sector worldwide, demanding greater adaptability and resilience than ever before. Like many others in our community, Grin is not immune to these pressures and must take decisive action to ensure its sustainability and continued success.\"The spokesperson did not respond to a question about the size of the layoffs but indicated in the statement that \"many\" employees had been cut.Previously, the company conducted layoffs impacting roles across marketing and engineering. First, in November 2022, the company laid off 60 staffers, mostly in Grin's sales department, the company confirmed to BI at the time. Then, in March 2023, the company laid off several staffers across multiple departments, sources close to the company told Business Insider. Some staffers were caught off guard by the 2023 layoffs.\"I do feel hurt by the cuts,\" a former staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect career prospects, told BI last year. \"I feel like my team in general pulled all nighters and weekend hours to get a critical project done.\"Grin is among several creator-economy startups that have laid off staff in recent months, including Jellysmack, which laid off 30 staffers in the US and France in January, and esports organization FaZe Clan, which cut 20% of staff in 2023. The impacted staffers in this latest round of cuts will receive a three-month severance package and extended healthcare benefits, the Grin spokesperson said. \"Reductions are never easy, and we are so grateful and proud of the incredible work our team has delivered to date,\" the spokesperson said.",

The company had 3,563 employees as of December 31, meaning the reduction could affect around 140 people.A Criteo spokesperson confirmed the news, saying in a statement that the company regularly reviews its business to ensure its resources align with its strategy and financial performance. \"As a result, we've made the difficult decision to reduce headcount by up to 4% globally,\" the statement said. \"This change provides greater operational efficiency and enables us to invest in our growth areas.\"Founded in Paris in 2005, Criteo became known as the poster child of retargeting, an advertising method where advertisers specifically target people who had shown an interest in their products — for example, hitting someone who had previously browsed a jacket on a website with an ad for the same item, enticing them to return.But with the owners of web browsers and app operating systems clamping down on the tracking technology that powers retargeting, and global privacy laws making it easier to opt out of being tracked, retargeting has become much harder. In response, Criteo has sought to pivot its business to focus on the commerce media space, offering retailers tools to help sell ads on their apps and websites. It's also making a push in connected TV, letting its retail clients use data about their audiences to target users on TV and measure whether those ads drove sales.But these efforts are still relatively new for Criteo. The company said in February that \"more than 50%\" of its revenue comes from \"non-retargeting solutions,\" but retargeting still makes up a sizable, more profitable chunk.And its \"performance media\" segment, in which retargeting sits, is set to be dealt another blow in the coming months when Google's Chrome is expected to turn off support for third-party cookies. Chrome is the world's biggest web browser, used by around two-thirds of web users. Criteo said the expected Chrome cookie deprecation would negatively impact its revenue by between $30 million and $40 million by the end of this year, if Google goes ahead with its scheduled timeline, set for the fourth quarter of 2024. Criteo has been working to test alternative technologies to cookies as part of Google's Privacy Sandbox program. However, it's unclear whether those will be able to provide the same level of targeting and measurement in the long run.Industry speculation has grown in recent years that Criteo could become a prime takeover target. Its stock is currently trading at around $35, below its all-time high of nearly $59 in 2014.In February, the European activist investor Petrus Advisers raised its holding in the company to 5.5%. It wrote a public letter to Criteo's management team urging the company to perform a \"comprehensive strategic review, including to evaluate all ownership options.\" Criteo said in response that it was reviewing the letter and that it hoped to \"engage constructively\" with Petrus. In its most recent quarter, Criteo reported a return to profit on flat revenue, having made $70 million in cost savings over 2023. The company said on its earnings call that it would continue to be rigorous on cost efficiencies to offset wage inflation, while continuing to invest in growth areas.Criteo also made a round of layoffs last year, Digiday reported, though the company didn't disclose the number of employees affected.",

Messenger, the popular direct-messaging app within Facebook, was hit with a round of layoffs this week, according to two people familiar with the company. The cuts, which affected fewer than 50 employees, were part of a reorganization of Messenger and its operations.The cuts at Messenger followed a similar layoff that affected some employees working at Instagram, as Business Insider reported. Both organizations are said to have eliminated many technical-program-manager roles, effectively folding such work into the role of product managers. After Instagram removed the TPM position, other parts of Meta, including the Facebook organization in which Messenger sits, were expected to do the same, BI reported. A company spokesman declined to comment beyond saying Meta's efficiency work was ongoing.Although CEO Mark Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 his \"year of efficiency\" (laying off more than 20,000 employees, eliminating some manager roles, and putting an end to years of \"hyper-growth\"), he decided this year to keep it in place for the foreseeable future. This has led to a culture shift within Meta, with some managers taking pride in finding places to cut costs or slim down teams. A related spate of reorganizations is creating a sense of constant anxiety among some workers.The Facebook business last year underwent a structural change to simplify how it operates. It also was hit with layoffs, and cuts were expected to continue within the organization this year. It remains Meta's largest organization in terms of head count, with the most mature tools and platforms. Are you a Meta employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

The London-based company, which first launched in 2014 and offers tailored dog food plans developed by its vet and nutrition team, had raised $16 million in venture capital funding from the likes of Octopus Ventures and Slingshot Ventures before retail giant Nestlé Purina PetCare acquired a majority stake in the company in 2018. Tails.com has operated as a stand-alone company since.&nbsp;In January, the company announced internally that it planned to commence a round of layoffs that could affect up to 55 staffers in the UK, per documents seen by BI. \"In 2023 we carried out a review of our strategy and operating model to ensure that Tails.com is set up as a strong and sustainable business for the long term,\" a company spokesperson told BI. \"This work identified some ways in which we can work more efficiently and we are now looking at how that will impact our teams.\"The spokesperson said that it had \"notified the appropriate UK government authorities of proposed changes to the business\" and that Tails.com was following the processes set out.\"Until the consultation has taken place, there are no immediate changes to the business and we wouldn't disclose any additional confidential information as part of that process out of respect for both our employees and the legal process,\" the spokesperson added. Per UK employment law, the company is required to offer a statutory redundancy package to those affected by the layoffs. The documents stated that employees aged under 22 would get half a week’s pay for each year of service; those between 22 and under 41 would receive one week’s pay for each year of service; and those above 41 would receive 1.5 weeks’ pay for each year of service. The statutory pay would be capped at £643, which is $809, a week.&nbsp;News of the impending redundancies had surprised employees, a current staffer told BI.&nbsp;“We had this weekly meeting where they talked about our forecasts, and they kept saying, ‘we’re doing really well’,” the employee said. The company met 98% of its bonus targets last year, per documents seen by BI. But they also say that, despite investing heavily in growth, it incurred a loss of £10 million, around $12.6 million, last year. It now aims to get to a \"double-digit growth rate\" in 2024, so it can become self-sustaining by 2026.While the company documents acknowledged that it had hired 22 new roles in the past six months, they also said hiring for any non-critical business roles had been paused since November 2023.The layoffs were necessary to enable Tails.com “to deliver a more efficient strategy” and allow it “to scale in a financially sustainable way that balances revenue and profit growth,” the documents said. Tails.com said that the decision to lay people off was taken by its own executives, not its parent company Nestlé — although its board “supported the decision,” the leaked documents show.Tech companies have laid off around 39,000 staffers globally in the first two months of 2024, per Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous rounds of layoffs, these ones are happening while many tech companies are producing good financial results.Grammarly, Microsoft, and Google all laid off employees in 2024 — claiming that they were instead reorienting their finances to more strategic teams and goals. Correction: February 20, 2024 — An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the proportion of the Tails.com workforce that could be impacted by the layoffs.",

Still, there is heightened anxiety about more job cuts at Amazon as CFO Brian Olsavsky last week declined to say layoffs are over during a call with reporters.In an email to BI, Amazon's Amazon Health Services Senior Vice President Neil Lindsay confirmed the layoffs. \"We're seeing very strong momentum and positive customer feedback across our health care offerings.

        "Extracted Article": "Astarte Medical is shutting down, Business Insider has learned exclusively.The venture-backed startup sells software to hospitals to improve care for preterm infants.Its CEO explains how she decided to wind down the business and find buyers after eight years.Tracy Warren cofounded Astarte Medical in 2016 to improve care for premature babies. Eight years later, at the end of December, she told her board of directors over a tearful Zoom call that she planned to shut the company down.The somber call capped Astarte's story before the company truly hit its stride. Astarte, which sells software to standardize nutrition for babies in intensive care units, had raised $14 million in venture funding to date and landed contracts with four hospitals. It had big ambitions to keep growing and building out its tech. But the market downturn hit Astarte hard — and its customers even harder. Last year, the startup wasn't able to land as many new contracts as it hoped, with hospitals struggling to manage their slim margins. And without more customers, Astarte's revenue fell short of VCs' higher standards for a new investment.Astarte now plans to sell itself for parts and lay off its remaining staff, Business Insider has learned exclusively. Its quiet death fulfills the prophecy investors have been fighting against since mid-2022 — that many startups, struggling to grow revenue and raise more venture funding against the market headwinds, will be forced to this year to shut their doors for good.Warren said that without seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, she couldn't keep fighting against those headwinds. \"As a former investor, you can't drink the Kool-Aid for long,\" she said.Astarte's beginningsWarren founded Astarte in 2016 with Tammi Jantzen, a former colleague from the venture world, and Katherine Gregory, a former nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.Gregory had an idea to combine her research around the gut microbiomes of preterm infants with clinical data in electronic medical records to look for insights, and perhaps even generate predictions, to improve health outcomes for those infants. At first, Jantzen and Warren didn't know how to make Gregory's vision a reality. They invested their own money to get Astarte off the ground, funding a study at Brigham and Women's Hospital to analyze samples of more than 300 infants' gut microbiomes over their first several months of life. Nenov Brothers Images/Shutterstock The company announced its first round of venture funding, a $5 million Series A from backers including Viking Global Investors and Ben Franklin Technology Partners, in May 2019, and then built its first software product, the only product it would ultimately sell to hospitals, called NICUtrition. That software, designed for NICU hospital units, helps healthcare professionals adhere to feeding protocols for preterm infants as they are first fed through an IV after birth, through a tube through the nose or mouth after a few days, and eventually tapered off to feed normally.The startup wanted to get babies in the NICU growing on track with the development they'd see in utero — preterm infants are often still underweight when leaving the hospital — and set them up for long-term health, while creating more efficient systems for the clinicians caring for them in hospitals. But from early on, \"it was clear to all of us that selling to hospitals was going to be an uphill battle,\" Jantzen said.Fighting for dealsAstarte signed its first hospital contract at the end of 2020, then another in 2021 before raising $7.6 million in Series A-1 funding, primarily from its existing investors, that fall. Under those three-year contracts, hospitals pay Astarte monthly for use of its software.As healthcare funding surged in 2021, Warren said the startup had a game plan to land 10 to 15 customers and prove it could replicate its business at scale. But while Astarte was getting lots of first meetings with hospitals, the sales cycles had gotten longer after the COVID-19 pandemic tanked hospital margins, and Astarte was struggling to close deals. Then, in 2022, the market tanked.\"There was a lot of apathy in the market from the hospital side, fighting other fires,\" Warren said. \"Nothing was trending in the way of innovation, for sure.\" Astarte Medical's NutritionIQ product. Astarte Medical Astarte landed one more hospital customer in 2023, bringing its total customer count to four: Carilion Children's Hospital in Virginia, Gillette Children's Hospital in Minnesota, UVA Children's Hospital, and Arkansas Children's Hospital. But that one contract was supposed to be three, Warren said. The company had raised a small amount of debt from investors in the summer of 2023, and set out to raise more venture funding with the guidelines of closing three deals that year — ultimately missing its target by more than half.Astarte's revenue figures weren't hitting the mark, either. Warren said investors were looking for the \"magic number\" of $3 million in annual contracts. Astarte was banking less than $500,000 a year in contracts.Warren said Astarte's investors even had conversations about working artificial intelligence into the startup's pitches with new VCs to capitalize on the funding boom to AI startups. But Astarte ultimately decided not to make the promise to build AI into its tech for clinical decision-making.\"Honestly, it would've been disingenuous,\" she said. \"We had to tell our board, we've got the data, but we're not at the point where I would feel comfortable making recommendations based on that data.\"At the end of 2023, Warren said she took a hard look at the business and decided the best path forward would be to wind down Astarte. \"I knew how much money we would need to weather the next two years, and what we needed to raise relative to our stage,\" Warren said. \"Maybe if I'd seen a light that hospitals were going to get better, or that venture was going to come back strong. But it was kind of dismal.\" Astarte Medical's eight-person team. Astarte Medical Selling itself for partsNow, Astarte is looking for buyers. The startup is considering selling multiple assets, including its software and patient datasets, Warren said.Astarte laid off its remaining seven employees in January, she said. The startup is hoping to find a buyer by the end of the first quarter of the year. Astarte still has money in the bank, and can afford to keep the company together as it searches for the right buyer, Warren said. Once that sale happens, Astarte plans to start settling its debts, and then pay back its investors.Warren said she just wants Astarte's work to be carried on.\"The biggest thing for us is that patients actually get serviced,\" she said. \"If nothing else, our legacy should be that we've helped improve the lives of babies and their families.\"",

The startup, which matches nurses and other clinicians to open jobs in healthcare, cut staff on Wednesday, according to two former employees and more than a dozen LinkedIn posts. The former employees asked not to be identified to avoid retribution from the company.Nomad Health's chief marketing officer Maquel Shaw confirmed the layoffs in an email to Business Insider. She didn't say how many employees were impacted and declined to comment on the reasoning for the cuts. The most recent round of layoffs cap a stormy year for Nomad, as the startup grappled with hospital budget pressures by making multiple cuts to its staff. The startup previously cut 25% of its nonclinical workforce in October, Business Insider first reported. Nomad had already cut 17% of its staff earlier that year, in February, per Forbes.At the time of the October layoffs, Shaw said the cuts were a \"necessary but painful response\" to the changing needs of Nomad's hospital customers.\"While demand for contract nurses and allied health professionals remains high, healthcare organizations are grappling with budget shortfalls, which directly impact their immediate staffing demands,\" she said in an October statement to Business Insider. A number of medical staffing startups made cuts last year in response to the market downturn. Staffing platform CareRev cut 33% of its corporate workforce in June. The following month, nurse staffing startup ConnectRN slashed 20% of its staff, and IntelyCare laid off at least 30 employees.It's a grim new reality for the sector, which once attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capitalists to solve healthcare's staffing crisis. But that funding window all but closed at the end of 2022. Like most of its medical staffing peers, Nomad Health last raised capital that year, banking $105 million in June 2022.Do you have a tip about Nomad Health that you want to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey told staff in a note that a \"large number\" of workers were being laid off.It's Block's second layoff in recent weeks, though this one is much larger than the first.Last year, Dorsey told staff the company's workforce had grown more than its business.Jack Dorsey this week made good on his promise to conduct layoffs at Block. The cofounder and CEO who previously ran Twitter told Block staff on Tuesday that the financial-tech company was letting go of \"a large number of our teammates,\" according to a note viewed by Business Insider. This is Block's second layoff in two months, with the company in December laying off 40 people working on the music-streaming app Tidal. While Dorsey did not specify the number of Block employees laid off on Tuesday, a person familiar with the company said the number was close to 1,000.Dorsey did say that the layoffs focused on Block workers at Cash App, Foundational, and Square. He added that operations overall were \"getting leaner.\" Last year, Dorsey alluded to further layoffs on the horizon for Block. In previous notes reported by BI, Dorsey said he would put \"constraints\" on the company's growth because head count had grown more than the company's business. Staffers were told separately that Block would look to reduce head count by about 10%, as BI reported.A company spokesperson did not deny the number of layoffs but reiterated Block's plans from last year to cap head count at about 12,000 employees, a reduction from the 13,000 workers it had late last year.While Block's staff was told to expect cuts, along with drastic changes to how performance would be evaluated going forward, in previous notes, Dorsey made it seem as though the process would occur over several months. Laying off about 1,000 people in one day is close to the 10% reduction discussed internally. \"We decided it would be better to do at once rather than arbitrarily space them out, which didn't seem fair to the individuals or to the company,\" Dorsey said in his Tuesday note. \"When we know we need to take an action, we want to take it immediately, rather than let things linger on forever.\"The new cuts at Block add to an already heavy year for layoffs in tech. Google and Amazon made significant cuts to head count, while Meta is slimming down in a more roundabout way by eliminating certain job titles and telling affected workers they can reapply.You can read Dorsey's full note to Block's staff below: Team,Today our Cash App, Foundational, and Square teams are parting ways with a large number of our teammates. Following the \"constraints\" email I sent last year, each team took some time to evaluate themselves through a lens of stronger performance and stricter prioritization. Cash assessed each team's position against Cash App's long-term strategy to determine where reduction, consolidation, or reorganization is needed — Global, Marketing, and Commerce are most affected, however every discipline is getting leaner. Foundational focused on restructuring, centralizing, and reducing layers of management to address redundancies. For Square, the majority of our impacts fall within the Marketing, Creative, and PMM teams, where we've reduced overall budgets so we need to adjust team sizes.Why is so much happening in one single day? All of these teams were confident in the direction they're taking, and were ready to take action within the same 2-3 weeks. We decided it would be better to do at once rather than arbitrarily space them out, which didn't seem fair to the individuals or to the company.When we know we need to take an action, we want to take it immediately, rather than let things linger on forever.By now our teammates who will be leaving us have been notified, and throughout the day we'll be connecting with those entering a consultation process in countries where it's required.Are you a Block employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

The San Francisco-based company, touted as a Salesforce for product managers, was last valued at $1.7 billion in a round led by US hedge fund Tiger Global and Californian investor Dragoneer in February 2022.Since then, the company has conducted a series of layoffs, beginning in November of that year when it cut a fifth of its workforce, two former employees said. Another 10% of its headcount was cut in August last year, they said. Now, Productboard has begun another round of layoffs, the scale of which is unknown as yet, the former staffers said. Others have also spoken about the cuts on LinkedIn.The company did not respond to BI's request for comment.Productboard was founded in 2014 by two engineers from the Czech Republic, Daniel Hejl and Hubert Palan. The company boasts a list of 5,400 customers, including Microsoft, Zoom, UiPath, and Volkswagen. It became a rising star in Silicon Valley, raising $261.7 million from the region's highest-profile investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Index Ventures.Productboard is far from the only pandemic-era star to cull jobs as the economic landscape worsened. Startups and Big Tech companies alike have slashed their wage bills as the high-interest rate environment encourages businesses to prioritize sustainability over growth.In January alone, 76 tech companies have laid off 21,370 employees, according to tracker site Layoffs.fyi. This year's cuts add to the 262,595 job losses announced in 2023. Productboard employed over 500 at its peak in spring 2022, with CEO Palan even telling Bloomberg that the company planned to go public in 2025. Since then, IPOs have become increasingly rare with late-stage companies struggling to find follow-on investment as growth funding disappeared.The startup builds software for product teams to collaborate and incorporate feedback from customers, designers, and managers to ultimately create a better end result. In all, that optimizes workflow.The November 2022 cut at Productboard was deep but justified — many other startups had faced reductions of up to 15%, and Big Tech had already gone through two rounds of layoffs by then, one former employee told BI. But a different former staffer told BI it instigated a turning point for the company. \"It felt like everything sort of started drying up after the first round of layoffs — likely due to the market uncertainties; because of this the business felt like changes were required,\" they said.One ex-staffer put consecutive rounds of layoffs down to the slow pace of growth. As a result, the company frequently reorganized, changed priorities, and staffers struggled to show results, they said.LinkedIn now puts Productboard's headcount at 350.",

Although the company has not released specific figures, three former employees estimated that at least 100 staffers across all teams and markets were told on Tuesday, January 23, that they were to be let go.Austrian company GoStudent, billed as Europe's first edtech unicorn, offers one-to-one video tutoring. It was valued at $3 billion in its last funding round and is backed by some of tech's biggest investors, including SoftBank and Coatue. The scale of the layoffs is unclear. GoStudent employs more than 1,500 people, including its acquisitions, across at least 15 countries with different labor laws, per company figures from October 27, 2023.GoStudent did not confirm the scale of the layoffs when approached for comment by BI.CEO and cofounder Felix Ohswald confirmed the cuts on LinkedIn last week, stating that, while GoStudent had reduced its burn rate by 70%, it was \"still too high in light of the challenging market conditions.\" The business and strategy adjustments aim to make GoStudent fully profitable and cashflow positive \"as quickly as possible,\" he said.GoStudent was among a batch of startups to benefit from an uptick in demand during the pandemic as more people stayed at home and education went remote. But since then, the company has moved to reduce its wage bill repeatedly through layoffs.Indeed, it is far from the only company to endure several rounds of layoffs as the high-interest rate environment curbed investor spending on loss-making startups. This year, 82 tech companies have laid off 23,670 employees, according to tracker site Layoffs.fyi. It adds to the 262,595 job losses announced in 2023. GoStudent has also previously faced public scrutiny for lax vetting processes for its freelance tutors, tutor working conditions and being anti-competitive. The startup also held a lavish party, including fire dancers and tattoo artists, six months after it raised its Series D round in January 2022.The fresh round of layoffs is GoStudent's third following cuts in September and December of 2022, all previously reported by BI. Some employees were also let go in September 2023, according to three former staffers. A GoStudent spokesperson told BI that these were \"business as usual adjustments.\"One-to-one meetings and country-specific all-hands were scheduled throughout the day on Tuesday, January 23, three former employees said. A company-wide all-hands followed in the afternoon, announcing the changes to others, they said. \"I've been through so many of these firings with this company that where there's smoke, there's fire. People start talking and you get a sense of it. It's almost like PTSD, I just knew it was coming,\" one former staffer said.In a LinkedIn post announcing the cuts, Ohswald said the company had \"said goodbye to really, really great people.\"\"In other markets, we notified our teams to initiate their respective legal processes,\" he said. \"Because of this, there are some questions we just can't answer right now, and this makes everything so much more difficult for our team.\" The GoStudent CEO added that it had been an \"incredibly hard day\" but said there was a \"clear vision for this year.\"The company is cutting back some of its efforts outside of the DACH region, which consists of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, four former employees told BI. However, the company disputed this, saying that its commitment to customers and tutors in all markets \"remains unchanged.\"\"We have adjusted our paid growth strategy; however, we will continue to cultivate all markets, ensuring they are properly resourced,\" GoStudent said. It has pulled most of its marketing spend outside of DACH, according to one of the former employees and screen shots of a presentation seen by BI.\"In DACH, where we have been profitable for some time, we will continue to grow - working together with Studienkreis to double down on hybrid learning,\" Ohswald wrote on LinkedIn.\"Outside of DACH we remain fully committed to serving all markets; however, we will adopt a more organic growth strategy and will reassess the size of our market teams.\"",

This is the company's third round of layoffs in the last year. Jellysmack restructured in May, letting go of 13 employees in the US, BI reported in May, and it let go of staffers in France last February, as The Information reported.Jellysmack works with creators on distributing their content across platforms like Facebook and Snapchat to earn additional ad revenue, among other initiatives. In an email sent to employees on the cuts, Jellysmack's cofounder and CEO Michael Philippe cited \"a contraction of monetization across platforms\" as one reason behind the cuts and added that this decline was due to \"volatility in the digital ad market and a decrease in long-form distribution.\"Philippe also broke down a new company structure, which will include a focus on the company's technology and Al product offerings for creators.\"To preserve the long-term health of Jellysmack, we made some team changes to restructure our business around areas of traction and growth,\" a Jellysmack spokesperson told BI. \"As a result, some roles in the US and internationally were impacted.

We have to realign our resources around areas of the business where Jellysmack is seeing the most success. Unfortunately, this means our team will get smaller.If you're impacted by this announcement, you will receive a meeting invitation shortly. We take full responsibility for today's decision, which was not taken lightly. However, it is the right step to preserve the long-term success of Jellysmack.We'd like to provide you all with clarity on what led us to our choices. We entered this year with four key objectives:﻿﻿Initiate market consolidation through M&amp;A﻿﻿Accelerate our technology and Al platforms﻿﻿Become profitable on our Creator Services﻿﻿Grow our Jellysmack Originals channelsWhile we have successfully delivered on our M&amp;A strategy and are building promising new Al technologies, we have also experienced a contraction of monetization across platforms, due to volatility in the digital ad market and a decrease in long-form distribution. Though many of our creators and original shows remain successful, heading into 2024, we have to realign our resources to better serve our key objectives. We will focus our efforts and investments on our most promising creators; continue to scale owned creator IP and original shows, and develop new technology products for creators. This focus will result in changes to our current corporate structure to prioritize areas of traction and growth.Next stepsAs this plan affects employees based in different territories, the workforce reduction will comply with the laws of each geographical location. We have taken steps to ensure that departing team members are treated with a level of respect that reflects the meaningful impact they've had on the company. For our impacted US employees﻿﻿Employment Status: You will remain on our payroll until December 15th, 2023﻿﻿Severance Pay: We will pay 3 months of severance to departing employees﻿﻿PTO: We will pay for all unused PTO time﻿﻿Healthcare: We will pay to cover 3 months of COBRACareer support: We will connect you with an outplacement agency for career support as well as give you the option to receive support from our in-house People teamFor our employees in France We have presented to our \"Comite Social et Economique\" (the CSE is the equivalent of a Works Council and includes the employee representatives that you have elected) our proposed \"Plan de sauvegarde de l'emploi\", that, if homologated by the appropriate French authorities, would impact a number of permanent roles in France. If you are a French permanent employee, you will receive an invitation later today for an All-Hands Meeting on Monday where we will present you with an overview of the plan.For our impacted employees in other geographiesWe will handle terminations in other geographies in accordance with local labor laws, and with the same level of support as in each of our main geographies. We encourage everyone to support impacted employees by reaching out to your networks to help our colleagues find their next opportunities.What's next for JellysmackOur North Star remains unchanged: We still believe that creators are the IP of the century and the future of entertainment. Our mission is to develop and scale the most engaging creator brands of today into the digital media empires of tomorrow. Moving forward, we will operate under a new corporate structure comprised of three business units each, fully focused on specific objectives:﻿﻿Jellysmack Entertainment - Led by Sean, this unit will include existing and future acquisitions as well as Jellysmack Originals. The unit's objective will be centered around owned-creator IP expansion and monetization opportunities.﻿﻿Jellysmack Services - Led by Axel, this group will manage all activities and growth programs for our highest-performing creator partners and Network Media. The team's objective is to maximize the value we bring to creators.﻿﻿Jellysmack Technologies - Led by Robin (interim), this unit will continue to develop self-serve tech solutions that solve the pain points of creators.

        "Extracted Article": "Google is laying off hundreds of employees in its ad-sales team, Business Insider has learned.Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, told staff about the cuts Tuesday in a memo.It comes as Google shifts staff away from its large client team to one that serves smaller clients.&nbsp;Google is laying off several hundred employees in its advertising-sales team, Business Insider has learned. The search giant plans to cut hundreds of roles from its advertising-sales unit as part of a restructuring, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, told staff Tuesday in a memo.Schindler wrote that the cuts were the result of changes to how Google's sales team operated. BI previously reported that Google was shifting more staff away from large-customer sales, a team that serves the company's bigger advertising clients, to its Google customer-solutions team, which serves more medium-level clients. This was happening as more large clients didn't need access to as many of Google's resources, current and former employees said.This reorganization is the next evolution of that as cuts appear to be primarily targeted at the large-customer-sales team.\"Going forward GCS will be our core channel for scaling growth by dynamically delivering the right treatment to every customer — while LCS will focus on transformational growth for our largest, most sophisticated customers,\" Schindler wrote. He later added: \"While I'm confident we're doing the right thing for our customers, partners, and ultimately for our business, this will be very hard for many, especially across our LCS teams.\"Google is also attempting to automate more of its processes through products such as Performance Max, which uses Google's artificial intelligence to determine how advertisers' money should be spent across products. (A spokesperson told BI that this reorganization is unrelated to AI tools such as Performance Max).Chris Pappas, a Google spokesperson, told BI in a statement: \"Every year we go through a rigorous process to structure our team to provide the best service to our ads customers. \"We map customers to the right specialist teams and sales channels to meet their service needs.&nbsp;As part of this, a few hundred roles globally are being eliminated and impacted employees will be able to apply for open roles on the team or elsewhere at Google.\"The cuts come just days after Google made another round of layoffs across several other organizations, including its devices unit that houses Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest. At least 1,000 employees were cut in that round, according to a statement from the Alphabet Workers Union.In November, BI reported that Google's top and longtime ad exec, Jerry Dischler, was stepping down to be replaced by Vidhya Srinivasan, who joined the tech giant in 2019. Here's Schindler's memo in full:Team,Last month at GBO Live I shared our GBO 2024+ Strategy. We had a candid conversation on our rapidly evolving business reality, the profound moment we're in with AI, and how we'll intensify our focus on customer and partner growth. More than 20k of you watched, and overall, you gave us extremely positive feedback.As part of the session, I also made clear that a substantial channel shift was coming and that regularly adjusting organizational structures based on customer needs, the overall market environment, and available resourcing is a normal part of running a business diligently. This is nothing new for GBO; we've done this for many years — sometimes smaller, sometimes at a larger scale — and will continue to do so.In the last six months alone, we've executed strategic changes across three different teams: Global Partnerships, gTech, and Global Product Solutions — all aligned with our GBO growth principles. Each shift had a clear catalyst and expected impact with customer and partner needs as top priority. Internally, these moves are speeding up decision-making and velocity, simplifying complexity, and reducing hierarchy, laters, and duplication of work.This week, we're announcing the evolution of our sales operating model across LCS and GCS. Our goal has always been to have the right customer, mapped to the right channel for growth, with the best support models and streamlined operations. Every year we go through a rigorous channel management process to assess this and adjust customers accordingly. This year's adjustment will be more sizable than usual — similar to what we did in 2016 and 2017 — and it will play into the strengths of each of our sales teams. Going forward, GCS will be our core channel for scaling growth by dynamically delivering the right treatment for every customer — while LCS will focus on transformational growth for our largest, most sophisticated customers.As part of this shift, unfortunately, several hundred jobs will be eliminated or put at risk (subject to local regulations and consultations). Impacted GBOers will be supported throughout the process and can apply for open positions across our team (including some roles we'll be adding to take care of additional customers moving to GCS) or elsewhere across Google. Sadly though, we will have to say goodbye to many highly talented and amazing sales colleagues. There's no easy or best way to do this, but I've asked designated leaders to communicate personally with impacted folks in 1:1s. These conversations will start tomorrow across all regions; in EMEA, this process may take longer due to local regulations and practices. Next steps will be shared as quickly and respectfully as possible to minimize uncertainty.While I'm confident we're doing the right thing for our customers, partners, and ultimately our business, this will be very hard for many, especially across our LCS teams. Thank you for continuing to show up for each other with empathy, respect, and kindness. At GBO Live in two weeks we'll further discuss and answer all your open questions.Philipp.",

        "Extracted Article": "Mark Zuckerberg last year put all of Meta under a mandate of&nbsp;\"efficiency.\"That's carried into 2024, with Instagram eliminating a traditional layer of tech management.This week, scores of technical program managers were told their roles were disappearing.&nbsp;Meta's Instagram started off the new year by telling at least 60 workers their jobs were disappearing, sources told Business Insider. The change at the popular platform happened this week and affected technical program managers across the Instagram organization, according to two people familiar with the company and a post to Blind, an app popular with tech workers that verifies users' employment. The TPM role is essentially being eliminated at Instagram, but workers are being given the opportunity to apply and reinterview to become a product manager. However if they aren't selected for a new role, their employment will end in March.A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment. A former Instagram employee posted to LinkedIn about \"expected changes to TPM roles,\" adding that people are expected to \"re-interview for PM roles\" or product manager roles.TPMs in tech are positioned between technical workers like engineers and PMs. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg invoked last year a new company mantra of \"efficiency\" aimed at removing layers of management. The result was thousands of layoffs last year and a reduction in management ranks, as well as the rate of hiring and promotions, although the company has been hiring back some laid off workers.The elimination of TPMs is in line with what's been referred to as \"the flattening\" at Meta. Beyond layoffs, Meta's restructuring last year included some other management roles being eliminated, and many employees at the management level were told they could \"convert\" to another role not in management, as BI reported. After most of the planned mass layoffs were over last year, Zuckerberg in a meeting with employees did not deny that more jobs would be eliminated in the future. Insiders later told BI that the CEO was still looking to get the company's overall head count closer to where it was in 2020 before it went on a massive hiring spree. CFO Susan Li, too, noted changes would come to the company as it looked at projects and teams to \"wind down.\"Over the ensuing months, Meta employees were left to wonder if and when more cuts to head count would come as they were ordered to return to the office or else face being fired. A smaller layoff last fall hit a team in Reality Labs.Are you a tech employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

This is the company's third round of layoffs in the last year. Jellysmack restructured in May, letting go of 13 employees in the US, BI reported in May, and it let go of staffers in France last February, as The Information reported.Jellysmack works with creators on distributing their content across platforms like Facebook and Snapchat to earn additional ad revenue, among other initiatives. In an email sent to employees on the cuts, Jellysmack's cofounder and CEO Michael Philippe cited \"a contraction of monetization across platforms\" as one reason behind the cuts and added that this decline was due to \"volatility in the digital ad market and a decrease in long-form distribution.\"Philippe also broke down a new company structure, which will include a focus on the company's technology and Al product offerings for creators.\"To preserve the long-term health of Jellysmack, we made some team changes to restructure our business around areas of traction and growth,\" a Jellysmack spokesperson told BI. \"As a result, some roles in the US and internationally were impacted. We continue to have ambitious plans for Jellysmack and will invest further in areas of success.\" Read the exact email Jellysmack's CEO sent to employees in December detailing the layoffs, viewed by BI:From: Michael Philippe, Co-Founder &amp; CEODear Team, We are reaching out with some difficult news. We have to realign our resources around areas of the business where Jellysmack is seeing the most success. Unfortunately, this means our team will get smaller.If you're impacted by this announcement, you will receive a meeting invitation shortly. We take full responsibility for today's decision, which was not taken lightly. However, it is the right step to preserve the long-term success of Jellysmack.We'd like to provide you all with clarity on what led us to our choices. We entered this year with four key objectives:﻿﻿Initiate market consolidation through M&amp;A﻿﻿Accelerate our technology and Al platforms﻿﻿Become profitable on our Creator Services﻿﻿Grow our Jellysmack Originals channelsWhile we have successfully delivered on our M&amp;A strategy and are building promising new Al technologies, we have also experienced a contraction of monetization across platforms, due to volatility in the digital ad market and a decrease in long-form distribution. Though many of our creators and original shows remain successful, heading into 2024, we have to realign our resources to better serve our key objectives. We will focus our efforts and investments on our most promising creators; continue to scale owned creator IP and original shows, and develop new technology products for creators. This focus will result in changes to our current corporate structure to prioritize areas of traction and growth.Next stepsAs this plan affects employees based in different territories, the workforce reduction will comply with the laws of each geographical location. We have taken steps to ensure that departing team members are treated with a level of respect that reflects the meaningful impact they've had on the company. For our impacted US employees﻿﻿Employment Status: You will remain on our payroll until December 15th, 2023﻿﻿Severance Pay: We will pay 3 months of severance to departing employees﻿﻿PTO: We will pay for all unused PTO time﻿﻿Healthcare: We will pay to cover 3 months of COBRACareer support: We will connect you with an outplacement agency for career support as well as give you the option to receive support from our in-house People teamFor our employees in France We have presented to our \"Comite Social et Economique\" (the CSE is the equivalent of a Works Council and includes the employee representatives that you have elected) our proposed \"Plan de sauvegarde de l'emploi\", that, if homologated by the appropriate French authorities, would impact a number of permanent roles in France. If you are a French permanent employee, you will receive an invitation later today for an All-Hands Meeting on Monday where we will present you with an overview of the plan.For our impacted employees in other geographiesWe will handle terminations in other geographies in accordance with local labor laws, and with the same level of support as in each of our main geographies. We encourage everyone to support impacted employees by reaching out to your networks to help our colleagues find their next opportunities.What's next for JellysmackOur North Star remains unchanged: We still believe that creators are the IP of the century and the future of entertainment. Our mission is to develop and scale the most engaging creator brands of today into the digital media empires of tomorrow. Moving forward, we will operate under a new corporate structure comprised of three business units each, fully focused on specific objectives:﻿﻿Jellysmack Entertainment - Led by Sean, this unit will include existing and future acquisitions as well as Jellysmack Originals. The unit's objective will be centered around owned-creator IP expansion and monetization opportunities.﻿﻿Jellysmack Services - Led by Axel, this group will manage all activities and growth programs for our highest-performing creator partners and Network Media. The team's objective is to maximize the value we bring to creators.﻿﻿Jellysmack Technologies - Led by Robin (interim), this unit will continue to develop self-serve tech solutions that solve the pain points of creators. The group's objective is to accelerate our technology and Al products for both creator partners and our owned IP.Next week, senior leaders will hold meetings to share and discuss the vision and strategy for each team. We would like to thank you all for your commitment to Jellysmack. Our collective strength lies in the talented and passionate individuals who make up our team.To those who may leave, we thank you for playing such a crucial role in our collective journey.

It announced the job cuts to staff on Thursday.Four people close to the company, including one person impacted by the layoffs, characterized the job cuts as part of a strategic shift away from its consumer-facing business and toward its B2B trading technology. A spokesperson for Mojo said the company was not selling its B2C business, but declined to comment on whether there was a strategy shift. \"Regretfully, we let go of about 20% of the company today,\" the spokesperson said of the layoffs. \"It's certainly a sad day for our company and we thank those talented employees for their many contributions.\"Mojo had about 95 full-time employees as of last year, according to a 2022 pitch deck. The company would not comment on the current number of employees.Mojo, founded by Lore, Rodriguez, and entrepreneurs Vinit Bharara and Bart Stein, had raised $100 million from backers including Thrive Capital and the NFL Players Association. Mojo operates a sort of player stock market where users can trade on an athlete's performance as if it were shares in a company. The app launched in New Jersey in September 2022 and the company released this year a fantasy sports offering in 19 states and Washington, DC.Mojo is one of the last of an era of big venture-backed pre-revenue sports-betting operators that raised a lot of money to disrupt the US market. Sports betting is very expensive to compete in and the market for these companies has changed dramatically in the last two to three years. Funding has become harder for startups to come by and investors at all stages want to see a path to profitability in addition to significant user growth.\"Mojo was very ambitious and it was going to take a long time to find product market fit and profitability,\" one of the people close to the company said. \"It's one of the last dinosaurs of that type of startup.\" The company is one of several startups across the sports-betting landscape to cut jobs this year, in what has been a tough climate for early-stage companies in general.Mojo said it would have more news to share soon about what's next for the company.\"Stay tuned for some exciting developments soon,\" the spokesperson said.",

At the time, the company said it planned to continue growing after the combination, including by hiring more employees. Shortly after the deal closed, though, the newly formed Commure cut staff, according to a leaked email obtained by Business Insider.Commure CEO Tanay Tandon, formerly the CEO of Athelas, said in the November 9 email to employees that it cut staff \"determined to be redundant or whose service is otherwise no longer needed.\" The company didn't say how many people were affected. The layoffs came just a month after Tandon told Business Insider that Commure planned to hire \"aggressively\" following the merger. Commure didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.Commure provides a common data language for health systems to simplify tasks like moving patients between different providers, while Athelas creates software for tasks like AI-powered revenue cycle management. The new company said in October it plans to stack Athelas' software on top of Commure's data platform for its health-system clients.Asked by Bloomberg News in October if Commure would have to cut staff as part of the deal, Tandon suggested the company would instead seek to grow its headcount, including perhaps by hiring people affected by layoffs at numerous other healthcare companies since 2022. \"I think we're going to be one of the biggest hirers in the next year in healthcare and software, so hopefully a home for many of the folks that did get laid off in the last year or two,\" he said.Tandon told Business Insider in October that Commure's total headcount following the merger would be about 800. At the time, he said the company had about 100 positions open, and expected to hire hundreds more people in 2024.He added that Commure hoped to hire more employees in its sales and engineering divisions. The company does show openings in those divisions on its websites. A former employee affected by the layoffs, who requested anonymity to avoid retribution from the company, told Business Insider that staff were cut across the sales and engineering segments, as well as divisions like human resources, recruiting, and marketing.Both Commure and Athelas each had at least five years of cash runway before the merger, Tandon told Business Insider in October.He said the company expected to go public in the next two to three years.

        "Extracted Article": "Travis Kalanick's ghost kitchen company laid staff off on Wednesday.In 2021, Kalanick raised $850 million at a $15 billion valuation for the company.The cuts come as tech and real estate companies rethink staffing needs in a more difficult market.Travis Kalanick's ghost kitchen company cut jobs on Wednesday, two employees told Insider. Before the layoffs, City Storage Systems had more than 4,300 employees. It wasn't immediately clear how many CSS employees were affected.Staff were told on Wednesday that they would receive invitations for meetings with human resources if their jobs were being eliminated, and the company scheduled an afternoon all-hands meeting, according to the two employees who spoke with Insider. They asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive topic. Through CSS, Kalanick wants to reinvent the business of food, just as he upended the taxi industry globally by founding Uber. CSS units include CloudKitchens, which renovates US and Canada warehouses into ghost kitchen facilities for mom-and-pop restaurateurs and big companies like Chik-fil-A. Another arm, called Otter, creates software for ghost kitchens and brick-and-mortar restaurants. In fall 2021, Kalanick raised $850 million for CSS from investors including Microsoft, at a $15 billion valuation.The layoffs come in the midst of a difficult market for tech and real estate companies, with inflation, higher interest rates, and other headwinds.A CloudKitchens spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Customer issues in kitchens and with softwareCloudKitchens went on a warehouse-buying spree in 2019 through 2021, before interest rates skyrocketed. But as its facilities have come online, the company has struggled with high customer churn. Operators&nbsp;told Insider last year&nbsp;that CloudKitchens sold them a dream but sometimes delivered dirty kitchens in locations lacking adequate safety and technical support. Related stories The company owns more than 70 active locations across the US, though some sites sit nearly empty and at least 10 have been up for sale or changed hands in the last year, per public records and interviews with former real estate employees.The US real estate team has been cut over the last year, leaving a few employees focused on renovations and asset management instead of the acquisitions-focused groups that worked regionally. The FT reported&nbsp;in September that CloudKitchens was selling warehouses and laid off some real estate employees. CSS's software side has also faced operational bumps. Insider reported in August&nbsp;that some customers complained to salespeople that Otter's software package arrived late and was glitchy, disconnected often, and locked people out of their accounts. In July, a CloudKitchens operator who was invited to speak at an all-hands meeting complained about the software. In response, Otter's global general manager, Guido Gabrielli, a former Uber general manager, sent a Slack message to the full company promising better customer service.Otter originally built a management system to aggregate orders from DoorDash, UberEats, and other delivery platforms, so restaurants could use one tablet to manage all of their orders. The company has since built a point-of-sale system called&nbsp;Mercury&nbsp;that competes with Toast, and it has added other services like revenue recapture, to claw back money for restaurants from customer disputes to delivery platforms. Across its products, Otter is now focusing more on enterprise sales, instead of selling to small restaurants.Do you have a story to share?

A spokesperson confirmed the job cuts, saying the layoffs were done in order to restructure Faire to \"better align our teams with our long-term vision.\"The layoffs were company-wide, Faire said. People in engineering, product, design, and data science were impacted, according to one person familiar with the situation. \"We built our former organizational structure with multiple layers of management to support our pace of hiring. When we slowed down hiring last year, naturally we weren't able to grow into that larger structure,\" the company said.This is the second time in just over a year that the company has laid off workers, although this second restructuring appears to be bigger. It previously laid off about 7% of its workforce last October.

It was valued at $12.5 billion in May 2022 in a deal where the startup raised a $416 million extension to its Series G. Faire has raised over $1.4 billion since its founding in 2017. Its investors include Dragoneer Investment Group, Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, and Forerunner Ventures. Faire recently announced a partnership with Shopify that established Faire as the preferred wholesale marketplace for Shopify merchants. Shopify's point-of-sale technology is also now the preferred solution for Faire's customers. Shopify also became a shareholder in Faire as part of the deal, which Insider first reported on in July. The size of the investment was not disclosed.\"Our focus remains on being able to consistently support our independent retailer customer community as a reliable partner well into the future. We're thankful for the team members who've contributed to Faire's success so far, and are sad to part ways,\" the company said.Tech companies continue to lay off workers at high rates.

        "Extracted Article": "Nomad Health slashed its workforce by 25% in October after previously cutting staff in February. Nomad Health is one of a slew of startups that connects nurses and other clinicians to open jobs. The company said it's getting less business as hospital budgets shrink. Healthcare staffing firm Nomad Health just cut its workforce for the second time this year, as high inflation continues to squeeze hospital budgets. The startup slashed about 25% of its staff, according to two former employees affected by the cuts, as well as at least eight LinkedIn posts by current and former workers. The former employees asked not to be identified to avoid retribution from the company.Nomad Health, which connects&nbsp;nurses and other health professionals to open jobs, confirmed in an email to Insider that it announced a round of layoffs affecting its nonclinical workforce on October 3. The company wouldn't say how many employees were cut. Several healthcare staffing companies have been forced to cut staff this year, as higher costs for drugs and medical supplies pressure hospital expenses, leaving them with less cash to fill staffing gaps. Staffing platform CareRev cut 33% of its corporate workforce in June, while nurse staffing startup ConnectRN laid off 20% of its workforce and IntelyCare cut about 30 employees in July.\"While demand for contract nurses and allied health professionals remains high, healthcare organizations are grappling with budget shortfalls, which directly impact their immediate staffing demands,\" Maquel Shaw, chief marketing officer at Nomad Health, said in a statement to Insider.She added that the cuts were a \"necessary but painful response\" to those changing demands. Alexi Nazem Alexi Nazem Nomad Health cited similar factors when it slashed 17% of its workforce, or 119 employees, in February. CEO Alexi Nazem told Forbes at the time that the startup had seen demand in the healthcare staffing market tumble more than expected, and said he'd been \"too optimistic.\" Related stories \"We built our team for an economic reality that no longer exists,\" he said.Startups touting platforms for travel nurses and per diem physicians have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from investors. Staffing startups Clipboard Health and IntelyCare both hit unicorn status with valuations of more than $1 billion last year even as funding slipped across healthcare. Nomad Health also banked extra cash last year, raising&nbsp;$105 million in June 2022 at an undisclosed valuation.Do you work at Nomad Health? Want to tell us about your experience?

        "Extracted Article": "Edtech startup SchoolMint has cut staff again, Insider has learned.&nbsp;These cuts were the second round of layoffs this year for the company.&nbsp;Jobs were eliminated across all departments due to a \"rapidly-changing\" market, sources say.&nbsp;The edtech startup SchoolMint, which helps public schools and charter schools increase and manage student enrollment, cut 29 full-time staff members last week, or 14.5% of staff, Insider has learned. According to multiple sources familiar with the layoffs, this was not the first time this year SchoolMint has eliminated head count. The company previously cut a similar amount of jobs in March of this year. Sources said 11 open roles are not being backfilled in this latest round as well. Several company-wide initiatives were now \"complete,\" according to official communication about the layoffs from the company to non-affected employees.Before these cuts, there were over 250 employees at SchoolMint, according to sources and LinkedIn data. In a June blog post, SchoolMint listed the total number of employees as 200. The second, more recent round of layoffs took place last week. Affected employees were notified in an email, citing the \"rapidly-changing market\" for the company. This differed from the initial round of layoffs in March, where employees initially received one-on-one phone calls from managers and an HR representative breaking the news, a former employee said. Founded in 2013, SchoolMint was initially venture-backed, receiving seed funding in 2014 from investors like NewSchools Venture Fund, the partners of whom later formed Reach Capital and led SchoolMint's subsequent Series A round. The company also went through the edtech startup accelerator Imagine K-12, which merged with Y Combinator in 2016. In 2017, SchoolMint was acquired by the private equity firm BV Investment Partners.The layoffs at SchoolMint come at an uncertain time for the edtech market, as the sector's pandemic-induced capital boom has seen an increasing slowdown. The first half of 2023 only saw $1.8 billion in global edtech venture funding, less than half of the total for the first half of 2022, which was $4.5 billion, Insider previously reported.Other edtech companies have also faced layoffs this year, including unicorns Paper and Byju's. SchoolMint itself has not been immune to this uncertainty in the broader edtech market. The organization had undergone companywide changes in the past year, including a re-organization of talent, a former employee told Insider. The company moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Lafayette, Louisiana in 2020, and the new offices were completed in May 2023, according to a company blog post.According to Glassdoor reviews on SchoolMint, former employees have been frustrated with the company's multiple re-organizations, especially the increase in workload after the first round of layoffs.\"It's never felt like there's been clarity or transparency,\" a former employee told Insider. A spokesperson for SchoolMint declined to comment.Do you work for an edtech startup? Got a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "SoftBank-backed startup Sendoso conducted another round of layoffs on Tuesday.The startup has laid off hundreds of workers over four rounds of cuts in the last 16 months.Amid a difficult funding environment, startups are cutting staff — sometimes in multiple rounds.SoftBank-backed gifting startup Sendoso laid off an undisclosed number of employees in its latest round of job cuts on Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear how many employees were let go, but workers in engineering, HR, accounting, and customer success posted on LinkedIn that their jobs had been eliminated. One former employee told Insider they were told they were being laid off due to a company restructuring.This is the fourth time in the last 16 months that Sendoso has axed its headcount: the marketing startup in June 2022 laid off around 100 employees from its then 700-employee workforce, Insider previously reported. The 14% staff cuts, which affected workers in both the U.S. and Ireland, came amid a broad wave of tech-industry layoffs resulting from market volatility and pullback in VC funding. The company has done three other rounds of layoffs, according to sources.Representatives for Sendoso and SoftBank did not return Insider's request for comment.Sendoso's platform allows marketing, sales, and HR workers to digitally send gifts to build relationships with clients and employees. Its marketplace includes products like food, alcohol, company swag, and virtual experiences. While it's not clear why Sendoso has resorted to layoffs, many companies have cut back on spending amid economic uncertainty over the last two years. The e-commerce industry in particular has had to readjust to lower growth rates after seeing online sales soar during the earlier days of the pandemic.Sendoso is one of thousands of tech companies laying off workers in the last year and a half. Many startups, specifically, are struggling as VCs continue to dole out less cash following a funding bonanza in 2020, 2021, and the very beginning of last year. VC investment in the first quarter of 2023 was down 53% year over year, according to Crunchbase.As startups can no longer count on their investors to complete a new funding round, many instead are looking inward to cutting costs – including headcount, most companies' most significant expense. Sendoso most recently raised $100 million in a Series C funding round led by SoftBank Vision Fund. The VC-investing arm of Japanese internet investment company SoftBank experienced an abysmal 2022 thanks to failed bets in cryptocurrency exchange FTX and an exodus of senior leaders.While SoftBank has bet big on winners including DoorDash and TikTok parent company ByteDance, the company's VC firm has backed even more colossal failures, including WeWork, Better, and Greensill Capital. It also backed View, a smart-glass company known as one of the worst SPAC deals ever and risks being de-listed by the Stock exchange.Better, which went public in August via a long-delayed SPAC deal, conducted another round of layoffs last month. Other SoftBank-backed startups have cut jobs multiple times, including rapid-delivery startup Gopuff — which cut workers in April 2022, July 2022, and March 2023 — and restaurant software company Nextbite – which also cut jobs twice in 2022 and again in May of this year. Across the entire tech industry, more than 1,000 companies laid off nearly 165,000 workers in 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking all of the tech layoffs since COVID-19. In 2023 so far, that number has ballooned to nearly 240,000 layoffs.Do you have information about job cuts at tech startups?

The job cuts came to the company's Lululemon Studio team, the part of the company that ran Mirror's operations.Lululemon acquired Mirror for $500 million in 2020. However, it struggled to grow sales for the device, which is essentially a mirror that displays workout classes. Mirror's founder and former CEO, Brynn Putnam, departed in September 2021. During its fourth-quarter earnings call this March, Lululemon announced it had taken a $443 million impairment charge related to the Mirror acquisition.

In June, Robinhood announced plans to acquire no-fee credit card startup X1 for $95 million. Insiders say the company is planning to merge X1 with its Robinhood Money organization, the subsidiary focused on cash management and spending features of the app like its debit card, direct deposit, and peer-to-peer payments. Credit cards are much higher-margin products than stock-trading and generally less exposed to volatile markets.A Robinhood spokesperson confirmed after publication that Robinhood made internal changes as a result of the acquisition and laid off what the spokesperson said was a very small number of the 60 employees who joined Robinhood since the acquisition. The company is still hiring and has 200 open roles, the spokesperson said. The changes come as Robinhood tries to address a shrinking user base. Monthly active users, the company reported, decreased by 400,000 to 10.6 million between July and August.\"This has been causing a bit of panic within executive leadership,\" one insider said, adding that X1 is Robinhood's \"latest pivot to try to get out of that rut.\"X1 and Robinhood's future in credit cards were the focus of the company's last all-employee meeting, the person said. Robinhood in June laid off 150 full-time employees in three organizations, according to an internal memo viewed by Insider: customer experience and platform shared services, customer trust and safety, and safety and productivity. The layoff was widely reported, but audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by Insider recently showed ongoing cuts have been deeper.It's unclear when the company made its most recent job cuts. Posts on a private group for people with a Robinhood.com email address on the tech-industry chat app Blind suggests layoffs as recently as Thursday, according to screenshots viewed by Insider.Last week, after Robinhood released its monthly metrics report for August, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note that performance \"seems to once again prove that retail is generally less active in weaker markets as both client engagement and client returns struggled in August.\" However, August is generally slower for user engagement overall, the analysts noted. The Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood has been expanding into other businesses for a couple of years. In 2021, it bought Say Technologies, which connects companies with retail shareholders, for $140 million.\"We started with trading and investing. But more recently, we've been helping customers with their comprehensive set of financial needs,\" Robinhood chief executive and cofounder Vlad Tenev said during an event held by TechCrunch this week. Tenev said he envisions not only allowing people to trade stocks, but \"we can help you save for retirement. And we can help you build up an emergency fund.\"Shares of Robinhood fell nearly 4% on Thursday while the S&amp;P 500 fell nearly 2%.

        "Extracted Article": "Better Mortgage went public at the end of August, completing a long-delayed SPAC deal. Execs celebrated with a toast, with one saying they could now \"sleep and breathe easier.\" But the stock dropped and two weeks later the SoftBank-backed startup handed out pink slips. Two days before its highly anticipated stock-market debut, top executives of mortgage startup Better, including CEO Vishal Garg, held an all-hands meeting to celebrate with staff.&nbsp; The stock debut, the result of a long-delayed SPAC merger, would give the company access to $565 million in capital, which Garg, had said would be used to improve the company as it waits for mortgage demand to pick up. Staff were treated to a bubbly toast and assured that the company was finally at the right size to be successful and grow, according to two people who attended the meeting.&nbsp;CFO Kevin Ryan told employees that they could finally \"sleep and breathe easier\" after two years of cutbacks that have reduced the ranks by 91%, according to the two people who attended the meeting, both of whom were Better employees.&nbsp; On its first day of trading on August 24, shares of the newly formed company&nbsp; — following a SPAC combination with Aurora Acquisition Corp. — plummeted 93% from where Aurora had traded the day before. (Excluding Aurora's stock price, shares of the Nasdaq-listed Better Home &amp; Finance are down more than 59% from the opening day.)&nbsp;Roughly two weeks later, on September 6, Better laid off about a quarter of its US mortgage sales and origination team, which underwrites the company's mortgage loans, interacts with its customers, and is considered a revenue generator for the company, according to the two employees. The employees, who said they were let go via phone calls, spoke to Insider on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution and concern for their future job prospects.&nbsp;The two former employees say the company now has about 75 employees on the mortgage origination team in the US as well as some employees in India. Better spokeswoman Jessica Schaefer told Insider the company has over 100 people left on the team.&nbsp; At the time of the SPAC merger, Better boasted 950 employees. According to the one laid-off employee, the company used to have 70 managers on the sales team, roughly the amount of total employees left after the layoff.&nbsp;In an emailed statement, Schaefer said that the company plans to replace at least some of the laid-off employees. \"New projections and remarks from chair Jay Powell signal no near-term relief from elevated borrowing costs so the mortgage market will continue to get tougher,\" she said. \"We are hiring more seasoned professionals who can sell in this tough mortgage environment and then making them 10x more productive through our technology.\"Employees were given 30 days of pay, and up to three months of company-provided COBRA coverage, according to two laid-off employees. Garg, who made headlines in 2021 for brutally laying off hundreds of employees via Zoom, told Insider before the deal that the $565 million from the SPAC merger, most of it from a SoftBank convertible note, would allow the company to acquire underperforming mortgage platforms and continue to develop its technological platform, which both laid-off employees praised as the best in the business. Garg also said the money would give the company breathing room to wait out the rough market, and predicted a refinancing boom once interest rates fall.The mortgage industry has been hit hard by rising rates, leading to revenue declines and layoffs across the industry. But Better has been hit particularly hard, dropping from the nation's 10th largest mortgage originator in 2021 to the 59th largest by the first quarter of this year. The company, which posted a $172 million profit in 2020, lost $1.2 billion from 2021 to 2022, and recorded an additional $135.4 million in losses through the first half of this year.&nbsp; Related stories Both former employees told Insider that they were optimistic that the cash infusion might offer some relief after a year of what felt like constant layoffs. One of the employees described a team Zoom meeting where multiple people realized during the call that their Slack had been deactivated, a sign that they were laid off. Those people were able to say goodbye to colleagues before their laptops were shut down remotely, the employee said.&nbsp;",

        "Extracted Article": "Tiger Global-backed software startup Productboard is making another round of layoffs, sources say.The company, dubbed a Salesforce for product managers, was valued at $1.7 billion two years ago.Productboard was a rising star in Silicon Valley, winning over high-profile investors like Sequoia.Productboard, a software startup backed by some of the world's biggest tech investors, has instigated its third round of layoffs less than two years after it became a unicorn, Business Insider understands. The San Francisco-based company, touted as a Salesforce for product managers, was last valued at $1.7 billion in a round led by US hedge fund Tiger Global and Californian investor Dragoneer in February 2022.Since then, the company has conducted a series of layoffs, beginning in November of that year when it cut a fifth of its workforce, two former employees said. Another 10% of its headcount was cut in August last year, they said. Now, Productboard has begun another round of layoffs, the scale of which is unknown as yet, the former staffers said. Others have also spoken about the cuts on LinkedIn.The company did not respond to BI's request for comment.Productboard was founded in 2014 by two engineers from the Czech Republic, Daniel Hejl and Hubert Palan. The company boasts a list of 5,400 customers, including Microsoft, Zoom, UiPath, and Volkswagen. It became a rising star in Silicon Valley, raising $261.7 million from the region's highest-profile investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Index Ventures.Productboard is far from the only pandemic-era star to cull jobs as the economic landscape worsened. Startups and Big Tech companies alike have slashed their wage bills as the high-interest rate environment encourages businesses to prioritize sustainability over growth.In January alone, 76 tech companies have laid off 21,370 employees, according to tracker site Layoffs.fyi. This year's cuts add to the 262,595 job losses announced in 2023. Productboard employed over 500 at its peak in spring 2022, with CEO Palan even telling Bloomberg that the company planned to go public in 2025.

        "Extracted Article": "Adtech layoffs have continued into this summer — including at some companies that already made cuts. Ezoic, MiQ, Outbrain, and Brightcove are among the adtech companies with recent layoffs. They cite lower ad rates and prolonged uncertainty about the global economy. For some adtech companies, the huge wave of layoffs that struck in 2022 and at the turn of this year wasn't the last, amid prolonged economic uncertainty and a tepid ad market. In the past couple of months, some adtech firms have reduced their head count. In some instances, these were on top of layoffs from months earlier.Ezoic, a publisher-monetization platform, laid off 84 staffers, or about 28% of its workforce, earlier this week. The company had already laid off about 35 workers in December and about 10 more in February, Insider previously reported. The company also shut down its affiliate program this month. In an email to the team also published on its website, Ezoic CEO Dwayne Lafleur wrote that while the company hit record sales in the first half of last year and grew its team by 62% in 2022, this year had been much harder.\"Inflation has skyrocketed, interest rates have risen, crypto markets have crashed, and technology investment and spending have declined,\" Lafleur wrote. \"As a result, ad rates are down nearly 35% from their peak.\"The content-recommendation company Outbrain followed up a small round of layoffs last summer with another reduction in force in June. About 90 employees, or 10% of the company, were affected, Calcalist first reported. A spokesperson for the company, which reported a 9% decline in revenue in the first quarter of the year, said that \"this past year has seen rapid change across our industry and our business\" and that it was working on efficiency, while investing in its growth areas. On May 3, Brightcove — a video-streaming platform with a recently launched ad-monetization product — said it would incur charges of between $2 million and $2.2 million related to a 10% reduction of its workforce affecting about 70 people. Brightcove CEO Marc DeBevoise cited \"near-term revenue challenges, including lengthening sales cycles and lower overages and entitlement commitments.\"Also this month, the private-equity-backed adtech firm MiQ shut down its office in Germany and made redundancies in the UK and other markets, which affected about 4% of its employees, the company confirmed. A spokesperson cited challenges related to the global economic downturn.\"In spite of this, our underlying business health remains strong — and while this is by no means an easy decision — the careful and intentional steps we're taking to rebalance and streamline our operations will allow us to invest in and sustain company growth now and in the years ahead,\" the spokesperson said. Adtech-industry insiders are also keeping a close eye on the fallout from MediaMath's bankruptcy. After it shuttered operations last month, more than 300 people lost their jobs, and MediaMath owes at least $125 million to hundreds of adtech firms and other companies. (Insider is listed as a creditor in the bankruptcy filings.)Elsewhere, large tech companies such as Meta, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Amazon are still cycling through their own previously announced layoffs in some countries, which has affected advertising employees, people familiar with those companies and individual posts on LinkedIn said.\"There's been a drip of layoffs, and it's really become a year to 'get through' with lead times blowing out\" in terms of contracts being signed, Sasha Auzins, the chief operating officer of the tech and data consultancy Elaboration, said. To be sure, the layoff phenomenon isn't hitting all adtech companies, and many that made cutbacks — including those listed above — are aggressively shifting priorities and have open roles listed on their websites.&nbsp;The second half of the year is also traditionally when advertising-funded companies make the bulk of their revenues. The media analyst Brian Wieser wrote earlier this week that several large marketers indicated they were increasing their spending, which signaled that the US advertising market should grow this quarter and \"remains on track towards mid-single digit underlying (ex-political) growth for the full year.\"Adweek recently reported a marked slowdown in adtech job openings in 2023, citing recruiters and industry insiders. But there have been some bright spots. Lee Walker, a UK managing director of Expand Group, which specializes in tech and media recruitment, said his agency's inbound job numbers were up 20% over last month. \"There are some really positive signs,\" he added.",

The latest cuts will change how Microsoft approaches customers and partners. Microsoft laid off more than 1,000 employees over the past week, primarily in customer service and sales roles, people familiar with the changes told Insider. The cuts go beyond the 10,000 layoffs Microsoft indicated it was planning earlier this year, according to these people. They asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.&nbsp;As part of these moves, Microsoft shut its \"Digital Sales and Success\" group, a sales and customer service team that at one point had thousands of employees. The company also eliminated the customer solutions manager role, moving some, but not many, employees to another role called customer success account management. Cuts also came to engineering project managers and marketing departments. \"The focus is more to accelerate consumption than it is to help customers,\" one person familiar with the changes told Insider. \"What was promoted as one of the largest customer service groups in the industry is now struggling to keep up with demand.\"It's common for Microsoft to make changes at the start of a new fiscal year, which began July 1.Microsoft leaders have been relatively quiet about the changes this time around. Many managers were left in the dark about the plans, including many who learned of the cuts on the day they were made, two of the people said. Leaders have not broadly provided a rationale for the changes to the sales and customer services teams, which also include significantly reducing travel and expense budgets. Some employees criticized Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff for not providing enough details about the layoffs and changes during the company's sales kickoff event this year, according to internal messages shared with Insider. One internal post about the event included a question about whether the Digital Sales and Success team would be replaced by AI tools.Microsoft reported in a mandatory filing to Washington state that it laid off 210 employees in the state and 66 remote employees, GeekWire reported last week. The people familiar told Insider that the cuts included hundreds more employees.\"Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. \"We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners.\" The layoffs — along with pausing raises and cutting bonuses and stock awards — have contributed to falling morale at Microsoft. Less than half of Microsoft employees who answered an internal survey called Daily Signals said they would stay at the company if they received a comparable offer, as Insider recently reported.Do you work at Microsoft or have insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Square Roots told staff it was closing most of its locations and cutting jobs, two former staff said. One farm in Grand Rapids will remain open to service business partners, a source told Insider. Square Roots told local news it plans to reconfigure some locations and may eventually re-open them. Square Roots, a tech farming startup that was cofounded by Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal, shut down the majority of its remaining locations on Tuesday and laid off most of its staff, two employees who were laid off as a result of the closures told Insider. The vertical farming startup was founded in 2016 and quickly grew to five locations, announcing a partnership with Gordon Food Service in 2019. Square Roots grows herbs and salad greens using shipping containers and artificial light and aims to localize food sources, making farming a year-round process.The \"smart farm\" company had over $90 million in total funding as of April 2022, and some of its backers include close friends of Elon Musk, including David Sack's Craft Ventures, according to Pitchbook. Square Roots CEO Tobias Peggs, who cofounded the company alongside Kimbal Musk, notified employees on a Zoom call on Tuesday that the startup would halt production at its locations in Springfield, Ohio, Shepherdsville, Kentucky, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, the two sources said. Kenosha News was the first to report that the Wisconsin location was facing a shutdown and WDRB later confirmed the company planned to shut down four of its farms.A former employee at the company's Grand Rapids location said that they were told one of the two farms at the location had been shut down and the other would stay in use to support the company's new business model.All but about 10 of the workers at the Grand Rapids location, which employed over two dozen staff, were let go, the former worker said. All on-site employees at the other locations were terminated, the other ex-employee said.The exact number of layoffs couldn't be learned. The company was estimated to have around 198 employees as of June, according to PitchBook. \"It was framed as a temporary thing, but the layoffs didn't feel temporary,\" the former Grand Rapids worker said. \"It wasn't like they were saying 'You guys will be offered your jobs back' at any point.\" Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal, cofounded Square Roots alongside CEO Tobias Peggs in 2016. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic The company shut down its original farm in Brooklyn earlier this year, laying off about 50 people at the time, according to a January press release.The recent layoffs came across as a surprise to staff, the ex-employees said. Square Roots had only just opened the Kenosha facility — its largest yet— in August and its Shepherdsville location had been operational for less than three months, they told Insider.\"It was just a normal day,\" the former Grand Rapids employee said of the latest layoffs and farm closures announced Tuesday. \"We were in the middle of production and everyone received an email and Slack saying essentially 'Drop everything and attend this Zoom call.' There was really no context as to why this was happening so suddenly and everybody was kind of shocked.\" During the Zoom call, Peggs told employees the company was shifting its focus away from packaging its own product and focusing more on supporting business partners like Gordon Food Services, the ex-staffers said.A spokesperson for Gordon Food Service directed Insider to Square Roots and a spokesperson for the startup did not respond to multiple requests for comment ahead of publication. The company told local news that Square Roots was changing its business model to focus on \"farming as a service.\" Square Roots CEO and cofounder Tobias Peggs showing some of the company's vertical farming containers in New York in 2017. Getty/DON EMMERT \"We're now operating our controlled climate farms exclusively for our strategic partners — whether that's to immediately secure the supply of high quality crops, or to explore novel ways of profitably growing high calorie food indoors,\" the company told WDRB. \"As we've made this move, we have had to pause commercial production in some of our facilities while we reconfigure them to be more suitable for servicing customers under the Farming as a Service model, and we look forward to bringing these facilities back on line in the future.\" Employees were told they would learn via email shortly after the Zoom call whether their role had been impacted by the farm shut-downs. The Grand Rapids employee said the workers at their location learned they had been laid off after they were abruptly locked out of their work email.\"It was quite abrupt and has been very devastating to this wonderful team of people,\" the former Grand Rapids employee said. \"A lot of us feel like we have to start from ground zero now. There's not a lot of hydroponic startups in Michigan, so it's tough on everybody.\"",

Oracle on Thursday laid off hundreds of employees, rescinded job offers, and cut back open positions within its health unit, three people familiar with the matter told Insider.

Oracle declined comment.Oracle Health includes health IT giant Cerner, which it acquired last year for about $28 billion. Current and former employees recently told Insider that Oracle has halted raises and promotions and laid off thousands of employees in the unit since the acquisition. Thursday's layoffs were due in large part to Cerner's challenged work with the US Department of Veterans Affairs, which hired Cerner to replace its homemade medical records with Cerner's technology, one of the people told Insider.Work began on the project in 2020 and has been plagued with many fits and starts. Most recently, the VA paused the rollout in April due to issues with the sites where Cerner's records have already been deployed. The VA and Cerner renegotiated their contract in May, allowing the government, per the VA, to hold Cerner more accountable.That situation means Cerner has less government-related work to do and led to this round of cuts, the person said. Cerner is Oracle's largest acquisition, and insiders say it has become a primary focus for chairman and CTO Larry Ellison, who has a vision for a \"revolutionary\" health data system in the cloud for providers and public-health officials to access patient data across organizations and believes the system will prove Oracle's cloud business to the world.Are you an Oracle employee or do you have insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "The venture studio Fractal Software will no longer start new companies, Insider has learned. As a result, the New York firm has laid off a number of recruiters and research analysts. Fractal is now throwing its resources behind its existing portfolio in the midst of a downturn. Fractal Software, a venture studio that creates startups by hatching its own ideas and hiring founders to execute, has laid off staff and will stop starting new companies, Insider has learned. After forming about 130 companies in the span of three years, Fractal now wants to throw its resources behind its existing portfolio, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.This change in focus means the company has no further need for recruiters, who work to enlist potential founders, or investors and research analysts, who are responsible for coming up with the ideas for those founders to pursue. At least 28 employees, about 25% of staff, have left Fractal in the past six months, according to LinkedIn. Fractal confirmed layoffs occurred starting in December, but would not specify the number of employees affected. A person close to the company said it has added new hires to a portfolio support team that gives founders assistance with product, sales, recruiting, and fundraising.The people recently notified of layoffs are staying on until September 1, a spokesperson confirmed. The job cuts follow a round of layoffs in December, which mostly affected the venture studio's recruiters.Fractal has a few more startups in the pipeline, with a goal of launching 145 companies, two people familiar with the company's strategy&nbsp;said. Fractal is still hiring for roles to start those new companies. In a job posting seen by Insider, the venture studio said it was still seeking engineers and operators to fill its \"last few spots.\"&nbsp; \"This may be your last opportunity to start a company through Fractal as this will be the last cohort of companies we launch before we shift 100% of our focus to our portfolio companies,\" the posting said.Fractal appears to be regrouping at a difficult time for startups. The market downturn has made funding for startups harder to come by, particularly for late-stage companies. So as Fractal's startups go out to raise new funds, some are struggling to shore up cash, according to several founders in the portfolio.Fractal's pullback from creating new startups suggests it needs to put time and money into helping its existing companies prosper, before it takes on any additional risk. \"Naturally, having launched so many companies, and having seen the initial success those companies have had, we're eager to ensure they continue to grow for years to come,\" Omri Bloch, chief executive officer of Fractal, told Insider in an email. \"That's why we are moving to our next chapter and focusing our time and resources on the companies we have created and the small business customers they serve.\"An unusual funding structureFounded in 2020, Fractal had been aiming to make it easier for founders to create software firms that target specific industries, a category known as vertical SaaS. Investors had long ignored such startups because they felt their markets were too small to produce an outsized outcome. That's now changed as companies like Procore, Toast, and ServiceTitan show that industry-specific software providers can become multibillion-dollar juggernauts, and changes in buyer behavior give way to new opportunities.Fractal's pitch to founders was to give them a made-to-order business idea and a cofounder to work with. According to founders and former employees, each startup received $1 million through a financial instrument called a simple agreement for future equity or SAFE note, which gave Fractal the right to own certain shares of a startup at the next financing event. It assigned a standard post-money valuation cap of $4 million, which was later raised to $6 million. In recent years, Fractal has produced vertical SaaS startups like scrap recycler software company GreenSpark, which received a Series A investment from Tiger Global in 2021, and behavioral healthcare software startup Ritten, which landed a seed check from 8VC in 2022.Regulatory filings show Fractal had raised $40 million in funding to cover costs like payroll and office space, from backers including Bienville Capital, an asset management firm in New York, and Joe Lonsdale's 8VC. A person familiar with Fractal's finances said it closed an additional $25 million this year.Though, Fractal doesn't use its own money for deals, multiple sources said. Before it had launched the first startup, it entered an agreement with Bienville, one of its investors, that the asset management firm would raise the funds to invest in Fractal's companies, for a slug of equity in each. Bienville had raised two funds to write initial checks into startups and to participate in future financings, growing its stake in those companies that performed well, according to two people with knowledge of the partnership. Regulatory filings show Bienville raised $25.6 million for the first fund and $209 million for the second, though a source familiar with the firm's fundraising efforts said those funds closed higher at $50 million and about $285 million, respectively.Now, Bienville is raising a third fund with a target size of $325 million, the source said. Bienville declined to comment on the fundraise citing rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Related stories 'A job well done'Fractal's pivot came as a surprise to some, but not those at the top. The three people familiar with Fractal's strategy said the venture studio never intended to launch an infinite number of startups, and that it made this clear to its investors and staff. Fractal has a narrow set of parameters for companies it's interested in building, which include the market size, competition, and use of software, one source explained.Fractal now says it's exhausted those opportunities in vertical software, according to sources. The company had spun up more than a hundred companies that now employ a combined 720 people. The layoffs, said one source, is \"representative in many ways of a job well done.\"Yet, several former employees told Insider that they weren't aware of the plan to stop forming new startups, with one adding that they would not have joined the company had they known. \"You could never tell people that and expect them to stay,\" one former employee said.Fractal employees received equity in the portfolio, which vests on a four-year schedule, and those affected by the layoffs will continue to vest all of their equity beyond their employment, a company spokesperson confirmed.Fractal is cutting costs as other venture studios and accelerators face the music. Newchip, an accelerator that helps start companies for a fee, is closing after filing for bankruptcy in March. On Deck, which bills itself as a community for founders, has slimmed down after mass layoffs last year. And Y Combinator, the Coke Classic of accelerators because it takes equity in startups instead of charging a fee for its services, has pulled back from growth investing and laid off 17 employees as capital dries up. Even as Fractal sloughs off the part of the business that creates new startups, a person close to the company insisted that the decision had \"nothing to do with the market environment.\"And it might reverse its decision yet. Two people familiar with Fractal's strategy said the company may decide to launch new startups in the future.Are you a Fractal founder or employee with insight to share?

The layoffs in France are still being determined, the company told Insider. The creator economy startup Jellysmack on Thursday laid off staffers in the US and France as part of a larger company restructuring, Insider has confirmed. In an email to Insider, a Jellysmack spokesperson confirmed the news. They said the company was making organizational adjustments and that eliminating these positions was necessary for \"operational efficiency.\"In the US, 13 roles have been impacted, but the number of roles in France is yet to be determined because of a legal process that is expected to take several months, the company said. Jellysmack is also working through a voluntary departure plan, known as Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, in the country. \"Streamlining teams is necessary to position our business for long-term success, address ongoing macroeconomic conditions, and continue adapting to the evolution of social media platforms,\" a Jellysmack spokesperson said&nbsp;in an email to Insider. \"We are committed to supporting all affected employees through their transition.\"This news comes shortly after the creator economy startup began hiring for a new M&amp;A leader to help integrate companies that it buys.Jellysmack, which identifies creator content that can be recut and distributed on platforms like Facebook and Snapchat to make ad revenue, had recently set aside $25 million to invest in kids and family influencers, as part of $500 million it had earmarked to license creator back catalogs. The company partnered with entertainment startup Pocket.watch, a studio that works with popular kids and family entertainment franchises like Ryan's World and Love, Diana. Jellysmack has had several rounds of layoffs in the last year, and laid of staffers in France in February, as The Information reported.Jellysmack sent a company-wide email on Thursday detailing the layoffs. Here's the exact email Jellysmack's president sent all employees, viewed by Insider:&nbsp;From: Sean Atkins Subject: Resetting Our Go-To-Market TeamsToday I am sharing the decision to restructure our go-to-market teams to better serve both our white-glove core businesses and our emerging lighter-touch, higher-volume products. In addition, we will scale down in some countries and reconfigure teams to allocate resources more efficiently. This will result in us saying goodbye to some talented teammates. Although we maintain a healthy financial position, we have reluctantly reached this conclusion as we continue to manage through the ongoing macroeconomic conditions.These are always tough decisions when it impacts our colleagues, especially with the strong work we've done together this year, but it is a critical adjustment we must make as a company to stay focused on areas of success and where we have the best tactical path to pursuing our vision. If you are among those impacted, you will receive a calendar invite to a 1:1 meeting with a manager in your department within the next 2 hours. For employees in France, more details are below. In the meantime, I wanted to provide more context about why we made this decision and how our teams will move forward.Jellysmack go-to-market 2.0Jellysmack's mission has been to help creators go bigger, by bringing them products, services, and infrastructure that helps them grow. We've had numerous successes from our unique Creator Program to Originals to JellyFi - all powered by our Al and technology. As a result, every day we are fortunate to work with top creators who inspire us and reach new heights with our syndication products. That core business has performed exceptionally well since launching, but what has worked historically is no longer as efficient as it once was in today's market. The opportunity across social media platforms has dramatically evolved and requires us to approach the market differently.For example, all the major platforms are chasing TikTok and focusing less and less on traditional long-form videos. From ad-spending to changing algorithms, the rise of short-form video will be a challenging evolution for creators, platforms, and the entire digital media industry.The good news is that we have made immense progress optimizing short-form content; partnering with over 300 top creators across TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Reels. We have also introduced new offerings that are gaining traction and providing more ways for creators to grow, and for us to serve even more creators. But the reality is that this more dynamic business cannot continue to be operated in the same way, with the same go-to-market strategy as our previous syndication product. Our business needs to move beyond a \"one-size-fits-all\" model into a more nimble approach. In a world where we will have white-glove services, financial products, self-serve products, OTT products, merchandise lines, AI editing solutions, and more - our teams are not structured in a manner that is optimized for the realities of these products' go-to-market needs.In order to fix this we need to re-envision our go-to-market team, prioritize speed of impact and take it down to a leaner, customer-focused team that leverages technology for efficiency.What's next for departing employees Our goal for those of you who are leaving is that you are treated with a level of fairness, professionalism, and compassion that matches your valuable contributions to the company.For our impacted US employeesSeverance Pay: We will pay 3 months of severance to departing employees PTO: We will pay for all unused PTO timeHealthcare: We will pay to cover COBRA for 3 monthsLaptops: You will be able to keep your laptop Other Comp: We will pay 50% of pro-rated bonuses and 100% of earned commissionsCareer support: We will connect you with an outplacement agency for career support as well as give you the option to receive support from our in-house recruitersFor our employees in France We have started discussing with our \"Comite Social et Economique\" (the CSE is the equivalent of a Works Council and includes the employee representatives that you have elected). Our shared desire is to come to an agreement that may take the form o a \"Rupture Conventionnelle Collective\" (a voluntary departure plan) and could impact : number of permanent roles in France. We will be working very closely with Employee Representatives to design together a strong support package for those of you who would be eligible to choose to leave Jellysmack's French entity (Keli Network France).Our hope is that we reach an agreement to match the same conditions as our previous agreement. If you are an eligible French permanent employee, you will receive an invitation later today for an All-Hands Meeting on Friday morning (10 am CEST in English and 11:30 am CEST in French) where you will be presented with an overview of the plan and have the option to ask questions.For our impacted employees in other geographies: We will handle terminations in other geographies in accordance with local labor laws and with the same level of support as in each of our main geographies.Moving forward as a teamFor those who are staying, we know this is another unnerving period in a chaotic market. Not only are you saying goodbye to people you've worked alongside, but many of you will be feeling uncertainty about the future. We want you to know that we're making this change to ensure our future is strong and that we are adapting to changes in real-time. There is no doubt that the Creator Era is here to stay. The opportunity for talented storytellers to build brands and businesses on the success of their content and communities will only grow. Jellysmack will be a big part of that journey for creators and the industry.In the coming days, you will be meeting with senior leaders to align on move-forward plans and strategies. I will host an All-Hands on Tuesday, May 30th @ 9:00 AM (PST)/ 6:00 PM&nbsp;(Paris) to provide more context and information.The vision for Jellysmack stays focused on being the best infrastructure partner for creator growth. With a leaner team and a more-diversified portfolio, we will be able to iterate faster, bring products to market sooner, and honor every teammate who helped us get here. I am enthusiastic about our emerging products and the road ahead as we continue to pivot to support our creators - and the industry - as they evolve and grow. I'm confident in this team, the momentum we already have this year, and the speed with which you all are adapting to the opportunities that continue to appear before us.Thanks,Sean",

        "Extracted Article": "Tractable, a computer vision startup, has laid off a chunk of its workforce, the company confirmed. Last valued at $1 billion, Tractable uses AI to help insurance companies assess damage to cars or homes. The layoffs come despite a broader trend of investors rushing to throw cash at AI startups. Tractable, a startup focused on AI and computer vision, has laid off a chunk of its workforce, the company confirmed to Insider. Founded in 2015 by CEO Alex Dalyac, chief technology officer Razvan Ranca, and ex-president Adrien Cohen, Tractable uses artificial intelligence to analyze photos of damage to cars and homes to help insurers accurately gauge repair costs. The company is primarily based in New York and London.In a statement to Insider, Tractable confirmed that it downsized its teams on two occasions; it cut 10 to 15 staffers in September 2022, followed by a larger cut to its teams in January 2023. The company declined to confirm numbers due to ongoing regional workplace laws, which mean the layoffs process is ongoing in different countries. In total, the reductions spanned seven countries.&nbsp; \"Letting go of team members is always a painfully difficult decision to make, but like many tech companies, we have had to adapt as markets and VCs move from rewarding growth regardless of losses, to rewarding profit,\" a Tractable representative told Insider. \"Taking these steps allowed us to prepare for a challenging economic environment and to position ourselves for strategic growth in 2023.\"Like many of its growth-stage peers, Tractable benefited from tech's bull run in 2021, cinching a $60 million Series D from New York-based private equity firm Insight Partners and Toronto-based venture firm Georgian. The round valued the company above $1 billion.But the startup has not been immune to the effects of the global tech downturn, which has culled VC investment into startups and seen tech firms layoff almost 200,000 employees globally in 2023, per layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi.&nbsp; Asked if the company has retained its $1 billion-plus valuation, the representative told Insider: \"Tractable was valued at $1 billion the last time we raised funds in June 2021.&nbsp;\"The entire tech market is now valued at different revenue multiples than in mid-2021 and Tractable is no exception.\"And as is common in growth-stage companies, Tractable remains loss-making, according to accounts for its UK entity filed with Companies House for the year ended December 2021, covering Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa but excluding the Americas. The UK entity lost £15.7 million (around $19.4 million) on revenue of £13.2 million (around $16.2 million), steeper than its loss of £6.7 million (around $8.2 million) on revenue of £8.7 million (around $10.8 million) the prior year. The growing losses were partly down to a near-doubling of the startup's administrative expenses year on year, which include staffing costs.In its 2021 financials, Tractable stated that the firm could continue operating as a going concern even if its losses continue, due to a $40 million revolving credit facility. Additional filings with Companies House in late 2022 list the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as a lender. Tractable declined to comment on whether it had raised further equity or debt financing.The layoffs come despite increased investor appetite for startups developing AI, fueled by the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. &nbsp;During the first three months of 2022, investors poured $24.1 billion into AI and machine learning startups; that traction has held a year on, with AI and machine-learning startups bagging $25.2 billion, according to Dealroom.&nbsp;",

        "Extracted Article": "Oracle spent about $28 billion to acquire health IT giant Cerner last summer. Insiders say Oracle has since cut costs significantly, such as pausing raises and laying off 3,000. Leadership changes and workforce cuts have made a critical project more challenging, they said. Since buying health IT giant Cerner for about $28 billion, Oracle has halted raises and promotions and laid off thousands of employees in the unit, four current and former employees told Insider. After the acquisition closed in June, Oracle has laid off more than 3,000 of the 28,000 original Cerner employees, one of the people said. It also has not issued raises or granted promotions, and, earlier this year, announced that workers shouldn't expect any through 2023, two of them said.&nbsp;Layoffs, which have occurred as recently as this month, have affected workers across teams, including marketing, engineering, accounting, legal, and product, a former employee said. Oracle declined to comment. While such restructuring is common after a company acquires another the size of Cerner, between the cuts, wage freezes, and Oracle selling Cerner's buildings in Kansas City — where Cerner has historically been a major employer — morale within the Cerner workforce is \"terrible,\" a former Cerner executive told Insider.The unit has also seen significant leadership turnover.Dr. David Feinberg, tapped to lead Cerner as CEO prior to the Oracle acquisition, has been sidelined in a largely \"ceremonial\" role, a former employee with knowledge of the matter said. According to his LinkedIn, Feinberg left the CEO role in September before becoming \"chairman\" of Oracle Health. Feinberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Soon after the acquisition closed, Ellison brought in Don Johnson — the former Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) boss once named by Ellison as a potential contender for co-CEO — to run engineering for a combined unit called Oracle Health and AI. Johnson abruptly left the post in January.After Johnson left, Oracle moved data and artificial-intelligence back under its cloud business. Oracle's vice president of AI and data-science services, Elad Ziklik, wrote in an email viewed by Insider at the time that the team would \"absolutely continue to focus on healthcare, and this will remain one of our top priorities across the org.\"Internally, the face of the unit appears to be Oracle Health General Manager Travis Dalton, who has been in charge of all-hands meetings. Cerner is Oracle's largest-ever acquisition, and insiders say it has become a primary focus for cofounder Larry Ellison, who has a vision for a \"revolutionary\" health data system in the cloud for providers and public-health officials to access patient data across organizations.&nbsp;That grand vision is already facing its first test. Oracle Health is in charge of a contract worth several billion dollars to overhaul the US Department of Veterans Affairs' information systems. The VA last month paused the rollout, which has moved at a glacial pace since starting in 2020, to fix issues at five sites already using the system.Do you have tips about Cerner or the VA rollout?

Layoffs hit newsletter publisher TheSkimm for the second time this year as it continues to face a punishing advertising market. Two knowledgeable sources said 22 people were cut, or about 13% of the workforce. The round appears to have included an EVP of sales, VP of national sales, and the creative director, according to LinkedIn posts of recent days. Insiders called it a \"mass layoff\" and \"bloodbath.\"TheSkimm employed about 150 people after January layoffs, when it cut about 10% of its staff, or 17 people. The cuts came amid a tough economic environment in which a wide range of media, entertainment, and tech companies have laid off staff. Digital publishing insiders have variously told Insider that they'd seen advertising revenue decline 15% to 30% year over year in the first quarter.Founded by Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg in 2012, New York-based TheSkimm took off on the popularity of its newsletter, the Daily Skimm, aimed at millennial women. Over the years, TheSkimm raised over $28 million from investors including GV (Google Ventures) and RRE Ventures, as well as prominent individuals like Spanx founder Sara Blakely, Shonda Rhimes, and Mariska Hargitay. The funding has fueled its expansion into podcasting, personal finance and lifestyle newsletters, virtual courses, and video production.The company hasn't raised funding since 2018, and industry insiders said it was looking for a buyer and new investment as its growth slowed. The company faced tough times in the pandemic when advertisers were spending less and reassessing which media outlets were truly essential, and TheSkimm's lighthearted tone felt out of step with the times. TheSkimm has also struggled to diversify its revenue sources, industry insiders said.",

It follows an earlier round of layoffs in August last year, which reduced its then-headcount by 12%. Permutive said it wants to focus on profitability amid a challenging economic environment and drop in venture funding. UK-based adtech company Permutive this week announced a layoff that is expected to affect just under 80 staffers, or about 40% of its headcount, Insider has learned. Staffers in the company's UK office have now entered a formal consultation process. UK employment laws stipulate employers laying off more than 20 staff must consult with employee representatives over redundancy plans. Permutive said it would conduct similar processes for international employees, in compliance with local laws.The company said the decision reflected prolonged challenges in the economy. A Permutive spokesperson said the company couldn't comment on the numbers or divisions affected. \"Late-stage venture capital has fallen by 80%, and as we chart a course for responsible growth, we've decided to prioritise profitability and double down on our existing customers,\" wrote Permutive CEO Joe Root in a blog post published after Insider requested comment from the company.This week's announcement followed an earlier round of layoffs in August, which affected 30 roles. At the time, CEO Joe Root said the company had over-hired in certain areas \"ahead of revenue.\"Ad businesses ranging from big tech giants to smaller startups have been affected by a deceleration in digital ad spending in 2022 and 2023, prompting a wave of layoffs and other cost-cutting measures across the space. It followed a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021 that didn't retain its velocity when consumer behavior returned to normal. Rising interest rates and inflation have also driven up costs for businesses, while venture capital funding has plunged. Permutive has raised $105 million in funding to date. It counts SoftBank, EQT Ventures, and Octopus Ventures among its investors.The company works with publisher clients like Insider, The Economist, and Condé Nast to organize their audiences into anonymized cohorts for advertisers to target. It also offers data clean room technology that helps advertisers and publishers match their data in a privacy-controlled environment.\"The changes we make today will see us focus on the capabilities our customer base needs now and what they will need in future to get ahead of industry changes,\" said Root in the blog post.",

The company, which runs influencer-marketing campaigns, has raised $145 million. Grin, a marketing platform used by brands to run sponsored campaigns with influencers on social media, is the latest creator-economy startup to lay off employees. On Tuesday, the company laid off a number of staffers across its marketing, engineering, and other teams, according to multiple people close to the company.Grin did not respond to multiple requests for comments about the nature and scope of the layoffs. This is the company's second round of layoffs in recent months. In November, a spokesperson for Grin confirmed the company had laid off 60 staffers. Those November layoffs, which affected about 13% of its staff, mostly impacted staffers in Grin's sales department, the spokesperson said at the time.Three former Grin staffers laid off on Tuesday, who spoke with Insider on the condition of anonymity to protect career prospects, said they were logged out of both Slack and email on Tuesday. A fourth former staffer said after the memo was sent, some staffers received communication from their direct manager, adding that they were told this round of layoffs was \"significantly larger\" than the last round, and that the cuts were \"not totally surprising given the state of Grin's business and the economy at large.\" The identities of the four employees are known to Insider.\"There was a memo sent on Slack, but halfway into reading it, my Slack account got deactivated, which is when I knew I was going to be a part of it,\" the first former staffer said. \"All departments were impacted, from individual contributors, managers, and directors. But the sales team took a really brutal hit.\" A second former staffer said they were also caught off guard by the cuts.&nbsp;\"I do feel hurt by the cuts,\" the third former staffer said. \"I feel like my team in general pulled all nighters and weekend hours to get a critical project done. To know that we put in this much work and some of us were cut seemed very unfair and unexpected.\"The influencer-marketing software company has raised a total of $145 million to date, per Crunchbase data. The company was founded&nbsp;by former Red Bull marketing manager Brandon Brown in 2014.

        "Extracted Article": "French retail marketplace startup Ankorstore is set to cut a significant amount of roles, sources said. The Tiger Global-backed company has raised 365 million euros (around $387 million) to date. It is the latest high-profile Tiger Global startup to slash jobs, following on from Stripe and Getir. Ankorstore, a $2 billion marketplace startup that counts US investing giant Tiger Global among its biggest backers, is set to cut a substantial amount of its workforce, sources say. The Paris-based company, which was founded in 2019 by veterans of Etsy and Vestiare Collective, has built a wholesale platform that connects independent shop owners with retailers. France's Ankorstore has raised 365 million euros (around $387 million) to date and is also backed by Coatue and Index Ventures.The company is currently undergoing a sizable reorganization that will result in job cuts, four Paris-based venture capitalists and another London-based source told Insider. The cuts could result in around half of Ankorstore's workforce leaving the business, inclusive of a cut of around 20% of staff last October, one industry source estimated. Ankorstore employed around 400 people in February 2022 but LinkedIn estimates that around 600 people currently work at the startup.A post referencing the reorganization has appeared on LinkedIn while over a dozen Ankorstore staffers have set their profiles to \"Open for Work.\"A spokesperson for Ankorstore said the company was unable to comment on the matter. 2023 has been a busy year for tech layoffs after a difficult 2022, as companies look to cut costs and rein in burn amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment. So far in 2023, more than 450 tech companies have laid off more than 120,000 staff, according to the tracker site Layoffs.fyi.Investment firm Tiger Global had been a major pandemic startup investor, with a particular uptick in European deals through 2021.&nbsp;In keeping with the broader downturn in the sector, many of those well-funded startups are now slashing jobs. Others in Tiger's portfolio reducing headcount include Stripe, Checkout, Getir, and Messagebird.Ankorstore competes with US rivals like Faire, which was last valued at $12.59 billion and expanded into Europe in 2021. Faire also cut 7% of its 1,200-person workforce in November, The Record reported. Usually, smaller retailers struggle to compete with bigger players because the brands they want to showcase will have a high minimum order requirement. Ankorstore effectively acts as the middleman with a minimum order of 100 euros (around $106), allowing smaller retailers to buy a greater variety of stock. Brands are then charged a commission on sales by Ankorstore.Speaking in February 2022, Ankorstore cofounder Nicolas Cohen said the company had to move \"very fast\" and that while it wasn't operating in a \"winner takes all market,\" there was definitely a first-mover advantage.&nbsp; The startup says it works with around 200,000 retailers and some 15,000 brands.Got a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "Cerebral plans to cut 15% of its staff, or 285 employees, Insider has learned. It's the mental-health startup's third round of layoffs in less than a year. Cerebral has been struggling to stay afloat following scrutiny of its prescription practices. Mental-health startup Cerebral is laying off 15% of its workforce, or about 285 employees, as the company reels from a tumultuous year of public scrutiny and federal investigations into its prescribing practices. CEO Dr. David Mou told employees in a February 27 email that the cuts are necessary for Cerebral to maintain a sustainable business \"to ensure we can continue to provide care to our patients in need,\" according to a copy seen by Insider.In an email to Insider confirming the layoffs, a Cerebral spokesperson said the decision is the culmination of Cerebral's efforts to reorganize the company to \"refocus on the most important service offerings for our patients.\"&nbsp; It's Cerebral's third round of layoffs in less than a year. The company previously cut about 350 employees between June and July, according to Bloomberg News. It slashed an additional 20% of its workforce in October, the Wall Street Journal first reported, which Insider confirmed.The startup provides mental-health services for issues like anxiety and depression, and has been focusing in recent months on improving care for people with serious mental illnesses, per Insider's reporting in November.Last year, Cerebral came under fire for how it prescribed controlled substances, including stimulants like Adderall, that can be addictive. Insider first reported in May that the&nbsp;Drug Enforcement Administration&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Department of Justice were investigating Cerebral's prescribing practices. It has since stopped prescribing many of those controlled medicines. The February layoffs will take place \"over the next several weeks,\" according to a separate email to laid-off employees&nbsp; from Cerebral's human resources team. Impacted employees will be notified through March 1, per Mou's email to Cerebral staff.The company's severance package for laid-off employees includes ten weeks of separation pay, full benefits through the end of April including health insurance coverage, and up to six months of Cerebral's behavioral health services, according to Mou's email. Related stories Cerebral's rocky futureIn 2021, Cerebral called itself the fastest-growing mental-health company. The startup banked $300 million in a December 2021 round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, skyrocketing to a $4.8 billion valuation. But problems began cropping up as Cerebral tried to grow too fast. Nurses working for Cerebral told reporters they felt pressured to prescribe medications like Adderall after short visits with patients.Insider reported in June that Cerebral had put hundreds of patients at risk, based on more than 2,000 incident reports by employees flagging concerns about patient care.&nbsp;In May, Cerebral ousted then-CEO Kyle Robertson and handed the reins to Mou, who previously served as Cerebral's chief medical officer. In a statement to Insider in December, a spokesperson for Cerebral said that the company is not fighting for its survival, and that the company is using technology to advance behavioral health, including by measuring clinical outcomes with surveys.Cerebral's pharmacy of choice, Truepill, has also been affected by Cerebral's troubles. The DEA said in December that it may revoke Truepill's ability to fill controlled substances, citing allegations that the online pharmacy startup unlawfully dispensed controlled substances for online mental-health startups like Cerebral.Do you have a tip about Cerebral that you want to share?

        "Extracted Article": "The robo-advisor Betterment is laying off 28 employees and shutting its Philadelphia office. Betterment told employees that rising operating costs and market volatility impacted the firm. Betterment's CEO said in a memo that the firm tightened spending and slowed hiring last year. The digital wealth management firm Betterment is laying off 28 employees, according to an email its chief executive officer sent to the company on Wednesday. \"You've all experienced the very difficult market conditions throughout 2022, and the outlook for the economy in 2023 is mixed at best. Our business is not immune to the effects of this volatility, or to the record levels of inflation that have pushed operating costs up for Betterment in all areas,\" Sarah Levy said in the email that Insider obtained.The robo-advisor laid off employees in roles across the organization, including in marketing, sales, and engineering roles, a person familiar with the matter said. In an Insider story about Betterment published in August 2022, the company said it had 450 employees. A Betterment spokesperson declined to specify how many employees the company has now and which roles were impacted. Betterment, which has its headquarters in New York City, is also in the process of closing its Philadelphia office and sub-leasing a floor in its offices in New York, Levy said. The spokesperson confirmed the company's plans to Insider. The spokesperson said the Philadelphia office space is small, but declined to specify how many employees worked there.&nbsp;Levy, who took over as CEO in late 2020 from cofounder Jon Stein, said the company had also tightened spending and slowed hiring last year. \"While our hard work has helped, it makes business sense to further reduce expenses through headcount reductions,\" she wrote in the Wednesday memo.&nbsp;The moves reflect the challenges that companies across the finance, technology, media industries, and beyond have weathered after a brutal year for the public and private markets. US-based firms as varied as BlackRock, Disney, PayPal, and Amazon have laid off employees as the economy has slowed. The overall health of Betterment, which oversees $32 billion of assets under management for 775,000 customers as of December, is tethered to market fluctuations. The company makes money in part from fees it charges clients to handle their investments. In recent years it has aimed to diversify its business lines by expanding its business-to-business offerings, where it can charge higher fees than with individual investors.&nbsp;The company's investors include the private-equity firm Francisco Partners, Citi's venture-capital arm, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Swedish investment firm Kinnevik. Betterment last raised capital in late 2021, a Series F round that valued it at $1.3 billion. It made two acquisitions — the US business of Canadian competitor Wealthsimple, and a crypto startup called Makara — in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp;\"Building something durable and sustainable ultimately takes a long time,\" Levy told Insider an interview last year. \"But we felt that just being what we historically called 'the robo' probably wasn't enough to be a stand-alone entity long term.\" Levy told employees on Wednesday that benefits to laid-off staff, in addition to severance and healthcare insurance continuation, would include removing the equity vesting cliff for employees who worked at Betterment for less than one year. She also said that because of the access employees have to customers' financial data, \"we had to turn off access to internal systems right away for those impacted.\"Do you work at Betterment?

        "Extracted Article": "Nearly all staff at adtech firm EMX Digital were laid off this week after parent company Big Village filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Former staffers are angry they didn't get severance, after a round of layoffs last year included severance. Big Village owes millions to media giants like Google, NBCUniversal, and Hulu, according to filings. When ad agency holding company Big Village filed for bankruptcy, it laid off nearly all of the roughly 100 staffers at its adtech firm EMX Digital this week, many without severance, according to four people who were impacted. The mass layoffs caught people by surprise, these former employees told Insider. They said that they were told late last year that Big Village was close to finding a buyer. One person told Insider that they had expected a deal to be finalized by January.But during a company meeting earlier this week, employees were told that Big Village filed for bankruptcy because its private equity owner Lake Capital Partners couldn't find a buyer, according to three people at the meeting. Big Village, EMX Digital, and Lake Capital Partner did not respond to a request for comment.Employees were also shocked by the mass layoffs because they had assumed that a round of cuts last fall had put the company in a better position, two people said. And while the people cut last year got severance, those laid off this week did not, according to three people impacted.\"To me, that is pretty inhumane,\" one person said. \"Even if they were trying to find a buyer, they certainly weren't making employees at the front of their minds.\" The former employees said that they were also frustrated and surprised by the quick exit of Big Village's global CEO Kasha Cacy earlier this month. On February 1, some employees learned that Cacy was leaving Big Village after an Ad Age story was published about her new role as chief media officer at ad agency Known.\"It seemed like the ship was sinking, and she jumped ship first,\" said one former employee. \"Whatever happened, it happened under Kasha's watch, and she was the first to leave.\"Despite leaving the company, Cacy led EMX Digital's meeting this week about layoffs, said a second former employee.&nbsp; EMX Digital's CEO Michael Zacharski also recently left the company but was not part of the meeting, that person said.\"Last week, we were told that things were being dealt above his head,\" said a third former employee.A small staff and part of EMX Digital's business that handles managed services with advertisers has been acquired by adtech firm Zeta Global, according to two former employees. Zeta Global declined to comment for this story. Cacy and Zacharski did not respond to a request for comment.EMX Digital got backlogged on payments to publishersTwo of the former EMX Digital employees said that financial problems started last summer, after Big Village rebranded from Engine Group. Lake Capital Partners had recently sold the European arm of Engine Group to consultancy Next Fifteen Communications Group for about $100 million, so the US arm changed its name to differentiate itself.There were internal rumors that this was when Lake Capital Partners started looking for a buyer for Big Village, according to two former employees. At the same time, EMX Digital stopped paying publishers, and between July and September, EMX Digital was bombarded by emails from publishers who were getting increasingly mad about missed payments, said one former employee. Some of the missed payments came from longtime clients, stretching back to 2015 and 2016.\"It was like a snowball effect,\" this person said.In October and November, staffers were told that the payment issues would be fixed, but by December, it was clear that the payment issues were spiraling, this person said. \"With every month that passed it got bigger and bigger,\" this person said.According to the Chapter 11 filing, Big Village has between 5,001 to 10,000 creditors, particularly large media companies that it owes for buying ads. The documents cite $10 million to $50 million in estimated assets for Big Village, and estimated liabilities are between $50 million to $100 million.Big Village's 30-biggest creditors include Yahoo (which is owed $2.8 million), Google (owed $1.7 million for search ads), and Hulu (owed more than $700,000), according to the filing. Other top creditors include Viacom's Pluto TV, Samsung Electronics, and Amazon Web Services.&nbsp; EMX Digital is the latest adtech company to be hit by big layoffs as advertisers rethink their spending during an economic downturn. Also this week, Yahoo laid off half of its adtech staff, equivalent to 1,600 people.To get in touch with Insider's Lauren Johnson, email ljohnson@businessinsider.com or follow her on Twitter at&nbsp;@LaurenJohnson.",

The pharmacy startup sold its patient data and drug inventory to Walgreens on Tuesday. Medly burned through cash as it tried to grow too fast, Insider reported in November. Medly is permanently closing its doors in February as the once-hot pharmacy startup's run comes to a turbulent end. Medly told its remaining employees in an email Tuesday afternoon obtained by Insider that its 22 pharmacies will officially close after Thursday, and all of its staff will be let go by the end of the month. The company, which once hoped to disrupt giants like Walgreens and CVS with its app to help patients manage prescriptions and deliveries in addition to its in-person stores, sold its pharmacy data and inventory to Walgreens on Tuesday in a bankruptcy auction.&nbsp;The startup's sudden shutdown comes after months of chaos for Medly, which declared bankruptcy in December. The pharmacy company burned through cash as it tried to grow too fast, Insider reported in November, showing just how difficult it is to make it big in an industry with low margins and fierce competitors. Medly's retail stores will shut on February 25, the company told staff in the same email. Because Walgreens bought Medly's pharmacy inventory and not Medly's retail inventory, the company said it will attempt to sell its remaining over-the-counter goods in stores before they close and online through its website.The online sales will continue through March 31, at which point Medly's distribution center will close down, per the email.Medly had originally planned to sell its store leases and other assets, including that retail inventory, Medly's lawyer said during Tuesday's bankruptcy hearing. But Walgreens didn't bid on those leases.&nbsp;Medly did not respond to a request for comment. The company said it will not pay severance to the employees it's letting go due to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.&nbsp;Medly's chief people officer told employees in a separate email that Walgreens had expressed interest in interviewing Medly employees to work for the pharmacy giant. The startup referred its staff to Walgreens' open job listings. Related stories Months of turmoil come to a headFormer employees told Insider in November that Medly was crumbling under mounting losses as the pharmacy startup blew through cash. The company, which last raised $100 million in venture capital in 2020, posted losses of $35 million in the first half of the year even before accounting for expenses like interest and taxes, according to a company presentation obtained by Insider.In June 2022, the startup was operating 51 stores and serving 32,000 patients, according to that same presentation. But Medly ultimately closed down nearly half of those stores and laid off about 1,100 of its 1,900 employees in August.Medly closed many of its pharmacies without notifying patients, leaving many patients stranded without necessary medications, according to former patients and employees. Walgreens will pay $19.35 million to Medly for its patient data, pharmacy inventory, and intellectual property, according to a February bankruptcy filing, helping Medly to settle some of its debts. December bankruptcy filings showed Medly owed millions of dollars to other drug and software companies, including nearly $10 million to the pharmaceutical wholesaler Cardinal Health.",

        "Extracted Article": "The unicorns Clari and Workato are among the latest startups to cut jobs. Workato laid off 10 percent of its workforce, and Clari had its second round of cuts in a year. The layoffs come as the tech industry saw more than 84,000 jobs cut in January. The VC-backed unicorns Clari and Workato both laid off employees abruptly in the past week, Insider has learned, capping a brutal start to 2023 for the tech industry. Clari's layoffs caught the startup's staffers off guard, according to one employee Insider spoke to.&nbsp; Clari, a buzzy revenue-software startup valued at more than $2.6 billion, whose backers include Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures, and Blackstone, cut more than 20 roles following a previous round of layoffs in August, according to a former employee who spoke to Insider, and multiple LinkedIn posts authored by former staffers.Workato, an automation-software startup that was last valued at $5.7 billion, laid off 10% of its workforce, or about 90 employees, a company spokesperson confirmed to Insider. It now has 824 employees globally following the job cuts. Clari and Workato are among the latest entrants in a long list of startups that have slashed jobs in the first few weeks of the year, including Carta, Bolt, Scale AI, Vial, Miro, and Chainalysis. They joined large tech companies such as Salesforce and Amazon, which each trimmed thousands of employees from their payrolls.The hefty number of layoffs indicate that 2023 hasn't put a halt to the carnage in the tech industry. Altogether, tech companies shed nearly 160,000 jobs last year, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Yet in the first few weeks of 2023, the industry has already slashed more than half that total, with more than 84,000 employees laid off in January and more than 3,700 in the first few days of February.Growing too fastWorkato has raised a total of $420 million in funding from investors such as Battery Ventures, Tiger Global Management, and Insight Partners. As startups and investors began bracing for an economic slowdown last year, Workato's leadership team began emphasizing a push toward profitability in its quarterly update meetings with staff, a former employee told Insider. Over the past two years, the company's revenue nearly doubled, but so had its staff, they said. \"I knew that some things were getting tight, and they were readjusting expectations, but I didn't realize it was going to come with a head-count reduction,\" the former employee said.Though the layoffs were unexpected, the former Workato employee said they appreciated the way the company delivered the news. An executive held one-on-one video calls with the affected members of the employee's team, rather than delivering the news in a company-wide missive or an all-hands meeting. The layoffs cut across several teams, the former employee said. Related stories Caught off guardClari, by contrast, delivered its layoff news in a&nbsp;group&nbsp;Zoom meeting for those affected. The layoffs caught staffers off guard, a former employee told Insider, given that employees had posted on LinkedIn just a few weeks ago about the company's strong hiring despite the broader turmoil in the tech industry. But despite raising $225 million in a round of funding announced in January 2022, Clari has shown signs of waning momentum over the past year.

        "Extracted Article": "Getir laid off roughly 100 US corporate employees this week, Insider has learned. The layoffs come as Getir combines operations with Gorillas, which could lead to store closures. Getir's US arm has struggled to pay store employees properly and held them to strict time goals. Rapid grocery-delivery startup Getir has laid off about 100 corporate employees, Insider has learned. The company made the cuts earlier this week, and they affected employees on several teams, including Getir's legal, operations, HR, fleet, and finance departments, a source familiar with the details told Insider. Before the layoffs, Getir's Slack channel for US employees contained roughly 260 corporate employees. Afterward, that number was about 160, according to the source, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.More cuts could be on their way at Getir's stores as the company combines its US network with that of Gorillas, another rapid-delivery startup, and eliminates overlapping locations, the source said. Getir uses small storefronts to fill orders and deliver them to customers close by, using bikes and scooters. In November, Getir reached a deal to acquire Gorillas, Insider reported. The acquisition closed for $1.2 billion, a steep discount to Gorillas' 2021 valuation of $3 billion. The companies haven't yet combined their teams at the corporate or store level.Getir did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.One employee said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that layoffs had happened. \"My time at Getir has come to an end,\" she wrote. \"Like several of my colleagues, I was notified my position was eliminated.\" The layoffs are the latest challenge for Getir, which delivers groceries and other essentials in as few as 10 minutes. The company laid off 14% of its workforce last May, the New York Post reported.&nbsp;In 2022, Insider reported on the conditions that Getir employees faced filling and delivering orders at the company's US stores. Workers risked being terminated for not meeting strict time limits, such as packing orders in less than two minutes, as well as trips to the hospital after accidents riding the company's electric bikes and scooters to delivery orders.Getir also struggled to pay store employees in full and on-time, several told Insider. That prompted an investigation from New York state's Department of Labor. The most recent job cuts were spread across different teams at Getir, the source familiar with the layoffs said. They also swept out many high-performing employees, some of whom had helped build Getir's business since it launched in the US in late 2021.\"What a lot of people are thinking is that they're getting ready to pull out of the US market altogether,\" the source said. \"They're trying to save money. It looks like they're getting down to a skeleton crew.\"In January, Getir appointed Kristof Van Beveren as its first US general manager, Insider reported. Van Beveren previously served as Getir's UK general manager and was founder and CEO of UK grocery delivery service Weezy. Getir acquired Weezy in 2021. Before entering the US, Getir built its businesses in densely populated European cities such as Istanbul, London, and Amsterdam. Even in those markets, Getir and its rivals have struggled to achieve profitability.&nbsp;The US presented additional challenges for Getir. Customers were used to buying all their groceries at once instead of making smaller daily trips, and the company had to build its operations from the ground up instead of relying mainly on acquisitions of similar businesses as it had done in Europe, analysts and former employees told Insider in 2022.",

        "Extracted Article": "The unicorns Clari and Workato are among the latest startups to cut jobs. Workato laid off 10 percent of its workforce, and Clari had its second round of cuts in a year. The layoffs come as the tech industry saw more than 84,000 jobs cut in January. The VC-backed unicorns Clari and Workato both laid off employees abruptly in the past week, Insider has learned, capping a brutal start to 2023 for the tech industry. Clari's layoffs caught the startup's staffers off guard, according to one employee Insider spoke to.&nbsp; Clari, a buzzy revenue-software startup valued at more than $2.6 billion, whose backers include Sequoia, Bain Capital Ventures, and Blackstone, cut more than 20 roles following a previous round of layoffs in August, according to a former employee who spoke to Insider, and multiple LinkedIn posts authored by former staffers.Workato, an automation-software startup that was last valued at $5.7 billion, laid off 10% of its workforce, or about 90 employees, a company spokesperson confirmed to Insider. It now has 824 employees globally following the job cuts. Clari and Workato are among the latest entrants in a long list of startups that have slashed jobs in the first few weeks of the year, including Carta, Bolt, Scale AI, Vial, Miro, and Chainalysis. They joined large tech companies such as Salesforce and Amazon, which each trimmed thousands of employees from their payrolls.The hefty number of layoffs indicate that 2023 hasn't put a halt to the carnage in the tech industry. Altogether, tech companies shed nearly 160,000 jobs last year, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Yet in the first few weeks of 2023, the industry has already slashed more than half that total, with more than 84,000 employees laid off in January and more than 3,700 in the first few days of February.Growing too fastWorkato has raised a total of $420 million in funding from investors such as Battery Ventures, Tiger Global Management, and Insight Partners. As startups and investors began bracing for an economic slowdown last year, Workato's leadership team began emphasizing a push toward profitability in its quarterly update meetings with staff, a former employee told Insider. Over the past two years, the company's revenue nearly doubled, but so had its staff, they said. \"I knew that some things were getting tight, and they were readjusting expectations, but I didn't realize it was going to come with a head-count reduction,\" the former employee said.Though the layoffs were unexpected, the former Workato employee said they appreciated the way the company delivered the news. An executive held one-on-one video calls with the affected members of the employee's team, rather than delivering the news in a company-wide missive or an all-hands meeting. The layoffs cut across several teams, the former employee said. Related stories Caught off guardClari, by contrast, delivered its layoff news in a&nbsp;group&nbsp;Zoom meeting for those affected. The layoffs caught staffers off guard, a former employee told Insider, given that employees had posted on LinkedIn just a few weeks ago about the company's strong hiring despite the broader turmoil in the tech industry. But despite raising $225 million in a round of funding announced in January 2022, Clari has shown signs of waning momentum over the past year. Its recent layoffs are its second round of job cuts within a year: The company slashed about 40 jobs in August, the former employee said. This time around, the company's go-to-market team bore the brunt of the layoffs. For several quarters, Clari had been struggling with lagging sales, the former employee said.A spokesperson for Clari could not be reached for comment.The former Clari employee Insider spoke with said that the spate of layoffs had prompted them to reconsider their dedication to the tech industry. \"I feel optimistic about it, but at the same time, I'm hedging my bets,\" the former employee said. \"I'm looking at possibly doing consulting, for instance, and getting out of tech in general.

The last major round of layoffs at TheSkimm, which targets young women readers, was in 2020. Bustle Digital Group, The Washington Post, and Buzzfeed are among other media companies that cut workers in recent months. TheSkimm, the popular newsletter publisher and digital media company, laid off nearly 10% of its workforce — or about 17 staffers — in mid-January, according to a source familiar with the matter. The cuts came amid a tough economic environment that has seen hundreds of layoffs at a wide range of news and media companies, and impacted writers, editors, producers, and marketers within the TheSkimm.&nbsp;Founded by Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg in 2012, New York-based TheSkimm first captured the attention of readers with its newsletter, the Daily Skimm, which caters to millennial women. The company describes itself as being \"dedicated to succinctly giving women the information they need to make confident decisions.\"&nbsp; Over the last decade, TheSkimm has expanded into podcasting, personal finance and lifestyle newsletters, virtual courses, and an in-house, full-service video production team. According to the company's website, its investors include GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Disney, RRE Ventures, and Homebrew Ventures.The company has seven open positions listed on its careers site, including postings for a chief financial officer and VP of commerce.&nbsp;TheSkimm last engaged in a major round of layoffs in the spring of 2020, just a few months into the start of the pandemic, axing about 20% of its 130-person staff. Zakin and Weisberg told staffers at the time, shortly before the layoffs, that the economic downturn had sent ad proposals plummeting 75%.&nbsp; TheSkimm is far from the only media company that has enacted wide-ranging personnel cuts in recent months. The Washington Post, Bustle Digital Group, BuzzFeed, Gannett, Dow Jones and People magazine parent Dotdash Meredith have all laid off staffers. Publications including Protocol and Gawker have been shuttered or suspended. Entertainment media companies have also been heavily impacted, with AMC, NBCUniversal, Paramount Global, Roku, and Spotify paring back headcount.",

        "Extracted Article": "TikTok has laid off employees on its human-resources team focused on talent acquisition and recruiting. The move comes during a brutal week in tech as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google cut thousands of staff. The scale of TikTok's layoffs, which occurred earlier this week, wasn't immediately clear. TikTok initiated a new round of layoffs this week, letting go of staffers who worked in talent acquisition and recruiting at the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. Impacted employees were informed on Wednesday, the sources said. A handful of people&nbsp;who identified themselves as TikTok employees also posted about the layoffs on LinkedIn. Insider was unable to immediately determine the scale of the layoffs.TikTok has cut employees on multiple occasions in the past year. In August, the company trimmed its advertising team in North America in a push to reorganize its sales, ad operations, and account-management employees into industry-specific verticals. In December, the company laid off a significant portion of its Russian workforce, many of whom were working in its Eastern Europe division, as it evaluated the evolving circumstances in the region following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, also laid off hundreds of employees at the end of 2022, the South China Morning Post reported. Unlike other platforms including Alphabet's YouTube and Meta Platform's Instagram, TikTok is a private company that does not publicly disclose its financials in the US.In mid-2022, the company's head of global business solutions, Blake Chandlee, in an interview with CNBC, projected strength around the state of its ads business, saying TikTok had neither experienced an ad market slowdown nor some of the headwinds affecting other tech companies. But in September, TikTok reduced its global revenue targets for 2022 by 20%, the Financial Times reported.It's unclear whether TikTok's layoffs will impact its broader recruiting and talent acquisition strategy. The Information reported in November that TikTok has plans to nearly double its staff at its Mountain View office. The company currently has thousands of global job openings listed on its careers portal. The layoffs come during a brutal week for tech workers. Amazon began the process of letting go of 18,000 staffers this week. Google parent Alphabet prepared to let go of around 12,000 workers. Microsoft cut 10,000 positions, and employees at Twitter also braced for a possible additional round of layoffs.Other creator-focused companies have also opted to make cuts recently in the face of a possible economic downturn, with around two dozen companies including Snapchat-maker Snap, creator-merch company Spring, and creator-monetization company Jellysmack, all laying off employees.TikTok did not respond to Insider's multiple requests for comment.",

The changes follow the announcement that Derek Wise, the unit's chief product officer, will leave this month. Wise's departure follows another high-profile exec exit after Don Johnson abruptly resigned this month. Oracle Advertising laid off another round of employees this month and the unit's chief product officer, Derek Wise, is leaving, according to internal emails viewed by Insider. Wise plans to leave Oracle this month and his product organization has already been moved under Stevan Vlaovic, the unit's senior vice president of product and engineering, according to one of the emails. Wise's departure follows another recent, high-profile exit of cloud and health leader Don Johnson, who Insider reported resigned abruptly this month.Previously called Oracle Data Cloud, Oracle renamed its cloud-based advertising and customer relationship management software to Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience. Oracle Advertising now falls under Edward Screven, Oracle's executive vice president and chief corporate architect who reports to founder and CTO Larry Ellison. Customer Experience is under Rob Tarkoff, executive vice president and general manager, who reports to Steven Miranda. The unit also laid off an undisclosed number of employees and reorganized apparently to replace Wise, according to another email from Vlaovic — who reports to Oracle Advertising boss Screven.\"Over the past few days we have had to make some very tough choices about the future of Oracle Advertising,\" Vlaovic wrote in a Jan. 17 email. \"Our strategy in Oracle Advertising moving forward is to be more focused and be able to self-fund our growth.\"Some of these business units have seen months of turmoil. Oracle's marketing and customer experience divisions were hard hit when Oracle conducted mass layoffs in August, as Insider previously reported. And Oracle's advertising unit also laid off about 60 employees in July,&nbsp;Insider reported. Chris Bell, the former vice president of identity product management who joined Oracle in April 2021, will be the advertising unit's new head of product, with four direct reports running areas like data strategy and compliance, and a data collaboration platform.&nbsp;\"I want to be crystal clear,\" Vlaovic wrote in the email announcing Wise's departure in which he referenced chief revenue officer Mollie Spilman. \"Our strategy has and will not change. Derek, Mollie and myself are hyper aligned with how we want to move forward and our increased focus will position us as THE key player in the advertising ecosystem.\" Related stories Oracle declined comment and Wise did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Do you work at Oracle or have insight to share?

        "Extracted Article": "Vial let go of its entire site network division, 40 to 50 people, last October, Insider has learned. These cuts followed an earlier round of layoffs during the summer. Just a month after the October cuts, the healthtech startup announced a $67 million funding round. Ahead of the deluge of tech layoffs that have plagued the beginning of 2023, one healthtech startup quietly slashed dozens of jobs late last year, Insider has learned. In October, Vial, which helps biotech companies run faster and more efficient trials, laid off an entire division. The cuts affected between 40 to 50 people, according to two former employees who spoke with Insider, as well as multiple LinkedIn posts authored by former staffers at the time of the layoffs. Insider granted anonymity to the former employees so they could speak about personnel matters. As of December 2022, Vial had 125 employees, according to Pitchbook.&nbsp;The Fall job cuts were preceded by another round of layoffs in Summer 2022 that affected multiple employees working on regulatory issues, said one former employee. The former employees added that the multiple rounds of layoffs came as a shock to many employees — especially because mere weeks after the October cuts, Vial announced a whopping $67 million Series B round, led by General Catalyst.To date, the buzzy startup —&nbsp;which was founded in 2020 by Andrew Brackin and Simon Burns — has raised over $100 million from prominent VC firms including Byers Capital and BoxGroup.Representatives for Vial did not respond to multiple requests for comment. General Catalyst also did not respond to request for comment.&nbsp; The cuts arose from a move to revamp Vial's business model, the former employees said. Initially, the startup had acquired the clinical trial divisions of clinics, managing the trial process and employing and providing benefits to clinic researchers, but in 2022, Vial's leadership decided to focus instead on its software offerings instead, the former staffer explained.When this department was slashed, Vial gave the original clinics the option to buy back the clinical trial divisions, which many took, leaving clinical researchers and employees in limbo in the meantime, the former employees said.Vial's troubles mirror those seen in many other hot healthcare and tech companies, like Truepill, a healthtech startup that saw four deep rounds of layoffs in 2022 alone. As the tough market environment continues into the new year, health tech companies will likely be forced to continue making difficult decisions on cost-cutting.

The layoffs affected members of the Whoop Unite team, which sells into organizations. In June of 2022, Whoop rolled out an intitiative to go after enterprises as customers. Whoop, a fitness-wearables startup, has laid off members of its enterprise team, totaling 4% of its corporate workforce, only seven months after it launched an effort to sell into organizations. The layoffs are part of a strategic decision to \"sharpen its focus,\" said a Whoop spokesperson.&nbsp;The workforce cuts come amid a broader wave in the tech industry with giants like Amazon, Salesforce, and Coinbase handing out pink slips to thousands of workers. And many startups have not been immune to scaling back, either.&nbsp; Founded in 2011, Whoop makes a wearable device that measures heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen levels, and skin temperature, and has earned fans like LeBron James and Justin Bieber, to early adopters in the high-tech world.It's raised more than $400 million in funding from investors like IVP, NextView Ventures, and Accomplice, and in August of 2021, at the height of a tech bubble, it netted a $3.6 billion valuation in a funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2.Early on, the company sold mostly to professional athletes and college sports teams, and as it added new features for measuring sleep and respiratory rate, it caught on with regular people, especially during a pandemic&nbsp;that caused people to pay closer attention to their health. Whoop provides the device to consumers for free and charges about $30 a month for an app subscription. Whoop had looked to expand revenue streams over time. In June 2022, it took the wraps off a new division, Whoop Unite, aimed at selling into organizations from universities to healthcare systems to technology giants. It hired Mark McLaughlin, a sofware-industry veteran, as chief business officer, and set a pace to double its enterprise headcount by the end of the year.\"We have always aspired to help organizations empower people with coaching and data to achieve their best performance,\" said Will Ahmed, founder and CEO of Whoop, in a statement announcing Whoop Unit. \"Our new dedicated enterprise solution realizes that vision and represents a new chapter in our company's growth.\"Now, a rash of layoffs raise questions about the success of the initiative. A woman holds a pair of Whoop wearable devices in her hands. Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images The cuts mark the second round of layoffs for Boston-based Whoop in less than a year.

Insider has learned the company has laid off dozens of employee and cut ties with Bankman-Fried. Autograph, the buzzy NFT platform cofounded by NFL star Tom Brady, has laid off dozens of staffers after separately severing ties with former board member Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of FTX, Insider has learned.&nbsp; The layoffs are mostly centered in the marketing, HR, and creative departments, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Autograph employs 124 people, according to Linkedin data.&nbsp;\"Like other technology companies, we aren't immune to the challenges of the market and had to conduct a small workforce reduction,\" the company wrote in a statement, confirming the layoffs. \"We look forward to continuing to build new Web3 fan experiences and products for years to come.\" Brady launched Autograph last year at the height of the NFT sports boom, along with entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt and his son Dillon Rosenblatt, who is the company's CEO.A modern, blockchain-enabled take on trading cards that have been around for more than a century, Autograph enables users to buy non-fungible tokens featuring sports stars such as Tiger Woods, Naomi Osaka, Derek Jeter, and Wayne Gretzky.&nbsp;Autograph, which is based in Los Angeles, closed a $170 million Series B funding round earlier this year led by Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins with participation from former top Andreessen crypto partner Katie Haun, who earlier this year raised a $1.5 billion fund. Haun, Arianna Simpson, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and Ilya Fushman, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, joined a star studded board of directors that already included Brady. Other board members include Eddy Cue, senior vice president at Apple, and Abel Makkonen Tesfaye,&nbsp;the recording artist known as the Weeknd.Bankman-Fried joined the board of directors last year several months after Brady and his then wife, Gisele Bundchen, invested in FTX.&nbsp;\"Autograph is at the forefront of the digital collectable space, and I look forward to helping them expand their capabilities,\" Bankman-Fried said at the time. \"As a pioneer in the space, Autograph has limitless potential as they bring icons and crypto together.\" It is not clear when Bankman-Fried left the board but his name is no longer listed on Autograph's website.&nbsp;By almost every measure, the NFT market has been hit hard since the beginning of the year amidst the broader pullback in stocks and crypto currency. &nbsp;Venture capital funding into Web3 startups in the third quarter of 2022 dropped by nearly half from the previous quarter, to $3.3 billion from $6 billion, according to Crunchbase. Many crypto companies, including Coinbase, Gemini, and OpenSea, have collectively shed more than 1,000 jobs through layoffs.&nbsp;",

The Austrian startup has already cut roles in Italy, Germany, and Vienna, Insider understands. GoStudent has raised $686 million to date and is also backed by Coatue and Prosus. GoStudent, a $3 billion edtech startup backed by some of the world's biggest tech investors, has started laying off staff for the second time in three months, Insider understands. The Vienna-based company, which counts Japan's SoftBank and US hedge fund Coatue among its backers, has already cut roles in Italy, Germany, and Austria with further reductions expected elsewhere, three sources familiar with the matter said.It is unclear how many roles will be affected but two sources based in the DACH region said over 100 people could be laid off as part of the cuts. A global all-hands meeting has been scheduled for 4pm CET on Thursday where full details of the job cuts are expected to be revealed. Screenshots of an all-hands Slack channel obtained by Insider show the number of employees in the channel dropped from 1,690 on Tuesday, to 1,430 on Wednesday. Employees who were laid off immediately had their accounts deactivated, one of the sources said.GoStudent did not respond to Insider's request for comment.GoStudent, which employs around 1,600 people according to its own estimates, is an online learning company offering one-to-one classes in over 30 subjects for students up to college age over video chat. The job cuts come after GoStudent announced in September it had slashed a tenth of its global workforce – around 200 staffers. They also follow GoStudent's acquisition of Germany center-based tutoring company Studienkreis earlier in the month as it shifts towards a hybrid model of teaching.The startup, which was founded in 2016, doubled its valuation to 3 billion euros ($3.19 billion) in a 300 million euro Series D round in January that was led by Dutch investor Prosus. As it grew rapidly, the company also continued a slew of acquisitions, including UK-based revision platform Seneca and Spanish tutoring marketplace Tus.A rocky macroeconomic environment has seen many growth-stage startups pivot from rapid, expensive expansion fuelled by easy venture capital cash to efficiency and profitability. As they find it tougher to raise cash from more cautious investors that, in practice, has meant cost-cutting and layoffs. Despite a boom in online education during the pandemic, education platforms are feeling the squeeze. San Francisco-based Outschool cut a quarter of staff last week, TechCrunch&nbsp;reported. BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School, also halved its staff, per&nbsp;TechCrunch.&nbsp;According to public layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi, almost 1,000 tech companies have cut more than 150,000 staff.A GoStudent spokesperson told Insider in September that it had \"made some adjustments to its business plan\" to ensure the company \"remains sufficiently funded throughout these unpredictable times.\"&nbsp;",

        "Extracted Article": "Spora Health's founder and CEO, Dan Miller, told Insider his firm was seeing thousands of patients. Insider has since found Spora is struggling after closing shop and laying off its workers in 2022. Miller was pushed out of his last company after he was accused of misusing funds, documents show. The way Dan Miller told it, his startup Spora Health was crushing it, providing high-quality care to \"thousands\" of people online. But now he's backtracking, after Insider's reporting found Spora to be struggling after laying off its workers. Miller founded the Bay Area startup in 2019 to take on a serious problem: In the US, people of color tend to have worse healthcare experiences and outcomes than white people. He said he wanted to erase these disparities by training healthcare providers in bias and health equity.Spora attracted a ton of media attention early on. Articles in Fast Company, TechCrunch, and other outlets highlighted Miller's mission. Insider first wrote about Spora in 2021 when it landed $3 million in a seed-plus round, bringing its total funding to $4.1 million. At the time, the company was tiny, serving about 100 patients in four states, Miller said back then. Two years later, Insider interviewed Miller to determine whether to feature him on an annual list of top young healthcare leaders. In an interview in July, Miller said the company had \"expanded significantly,\" offering online healthcare in more than 22 states. He said Spora planned to be available nationwide this year.Miller said Spora was serving \"thousands\" of patients \"right now\" and working with \"a lot of large enterprises,\" including Fortune 10 companies, to provide Spora's services to their workers or other groups of people. He declined to disclose those companies.\"I wish I could say some names, but I can't right now, but things have been going really, really well,\" he said in July. The impression Miller gave of Spora was one of a young company firing on all cylinders. Based on the interview, Spora's mission, and previous conversations with Miller, Insider included him on the list and published an interview with him.After the interview came out, a former employee contacted Insider to share a more troubling view of Spora, prompting Insider to look into the company more deeply.Interviews with seven former employees and a source close to the company, as well as an internal memo, suggest that Spora shut down, at least temporarily, near the end of 2022 and laid off its small team of workers after failing to pay them for a month. Some former workers are still trying to recover their pay from Spora. Insider also found that Spora's size might be more limited than Miller said. Some of the clinicians listed on Spora's website no longer work for the company or aren't seeing patients. Public documents show Spora's business registrations have gone inactive or fallen out of compliance in numerous states.Confronted with these findings, Miller confirmed in a phone call on October 23 that Spora had laid off all of its workers after it was unable to raise a Series A funding round last year. He said he had believed the company would need to shut down and that he was able to keep Spora alive by renegotiating contracts with employers and health plans and signing new ones.He said that more than 2,000 people had registered online to get care from Spora but that not all of them had attended appointments with a clinician. He declined to say how many people had received care from Spora this year but said \"it's been slow.\" The company, which now has fewer than five employees, is working to raise money so it can hire more people and grow, he said. \"Going into 2023, we were able to have another chance and keep our doors open and try to keep serving all of our patients and all of our customers and stakeholders,\" Miller said. \"But obviously as a solo founder and running the show on my own for a little bit of time, things are slow.\"Insider also reviewed internal communications and a complaint filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that show Miller was pushed out of his previous venture before Spora, a company that provided mental-health care online, after he was accused of misappropriating tens of thousands of dollars of company funds. Miller declined to comment on this company.Insider has removed Miller from its list of top young healthcare leaders. Spora shut down in 2022 and laid off its employees, email says The telehealth startup Spora Health's app. Spora Health In early 2022, Spora seemed to be gaining some traction. It had turned its focus from selling its services directly to consumers to also working with employers, Miller said in the July interview. The startup had secured at least one big contract, with Apple, according to three former Spora employees and another source close to Spora. A page on Spora's site says Apple partnered with Aetna and UnitedHealthcare to offer Spora to Apple employees. Related stories Apple and Aetna didn't return requests for comment. UnitedHealthcare declined to comment.Still, five former employees said Spora was treating few patients, and nowhere near thousands, as of the latter half of 2022. By the middle of 2022, things started to break down at Spora. Miller spent six weeks away from the company in June and July of that year while taking part in a Stanford Graduate School of Business executive education program, according to five former Spora employees and a source close to the company. Miller left Spora in the hands of his chief of staff, who had been with the company for a few months, four of those former employees said.His absence confused some employees, who were under the impression he was working to raise a Series A round. Two former employees said progress on various projects stalled while Miller was away because he wasn't available to sign off.In November, paychecks stopped coming, according to four former employees. Then, on the Monday after Thanksgiving, Miller held a company meeting in which he told employees Spora was shutting down, two former employees said. Three former employees recalled that Miller said the company didn't have enough money to continue operations.Miller followed up with an email to employees on November 30 that said Spora had ceased operating and \"everyone's employment is terminated\" as of November 28. Insider reviewed a copy of the email, which also said any retroactive payments would be made directly to employees' bank accounts. He said in the email that Spora was in talks to get acquired.Three former employees told Insider recently that they still hadn't been paid fully and were working to recover what they say they are owed. Miller told Insider he had expected to be able to pay employees and wind things down at Spora with bridge financing after the Series A round fell through. But he said an investor gave Spora less than it initially said it would and Spora didn't have enough money to pay all workers.Spora's investors, including Refactor Capital, Human Ventures, and MaC Venture Capital, didn't respond to requests for comment on this story. The venture firm M13 declined to comment.Miller said he paid some workers with his own money in November and December and then paid other former employees what he thought was the full amount Spora owed them in late February and early March of this year. Spora has been communicating with the former employees to determine how much it still owes them, and Miller said he was working to resolve the matter. Miller was pushed out of his previous company after he was accused of misusing company fundsMiller called Spora the third company he's founded. It's not the first to run into difficulties.Before Spora, Miller started the mental-health care company Level Therapy, an app launched in 2016 that people could use to have video chats with therapists, and FreshSessions, a marketplace for musicians to book recording studios, according to news articles and his LinkedIn profile.Level raised hundreds of thousands of dollars through the incubator 500 Startups (now 500 Global), a SeedInvest crowdfunding campaign, and from individual investors, company documents show. In September 2017, Level executives accused Miller of using company funds for personal reasons and demanded that he resign, according to internal documents and emails. Miller's cofounder also filed a police report that month related to his use of funds, according to an internal email. A police department document shows the report was filed but not its contents.An investor filed a complaint with the SEC in October 2017 alleging Miller misappropriated funds and misrepresented information to prospective investors about the company's finances and progress. Insider viewed a copy of the complaint.&nbsp;The investor said the SEC never responded to the complaint. An SEC spokesperson said the agency doesn't comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.At least $31,000 of expenses that Miller charged to Level in 2017 were for personal reasons and unrelated to business, according to an auditor's analysis provided to Level executives in September 2017 and viewed by Insider. A summary of the audit also says the full amount of an outside investment did not appear to have been deposited in Level's bank account. In a September 2017 email seen by Insider, Miller denied allegations of fraud. He eventually agreed to pay roughly $32,000 to Level, according to a copy of a promissory note dated December 13, 2017. He paid the sum more than three years later, in February 2021, according to a message viewed by Insider.By then, Miller had already moved on. In November 2020, news outlets reported that Spora had raised about $1 million in seed funding.In the October 23&nbsp;interview, Miller declined to comment on his time at Level. Spora most likely isn't operating at the scale Miller claimedThis year, Miller has continued to do interviews about Spora and celebrate company milestones, without any mention of the company ceasing operations or laying off staff. Related stories Miller wrote about company achievements on LinkedIn, including posts about a collaboration with a design studio and achieving accreditation for Spora's cultural-competency training program. In April, Spora issued a press release sharing results from its maternal-health program.Currently, Spora's reach appears to be more limited than Miller said in July. Spora's medical group has filed paperwork to do business in at least 18 states, but the registrations aren't active or current, or have been revoked, in 10 of them, according to Insider's review of public documents.In the October 23 interview, Miller said that Spora's counsel didn't file this paperwork on time because of a clerical error but that the paperwork had since been sent off to bring Spora's registrations back into good standing. He maintained that Spora had coverage in 22 states. Still, Spora's website as of October 27 allows people in only nine states to sign up for a membership.Spora's website also provided inaccurate information about the company's medical staff by including clinicians who no longer work for the company. As of mid-September, 11 clinicians — mostly nurses and physician assistants — were listed as available for appointments, according to Insider's review. Four of them told Insider they either no longer worked with Spora or hadn't seen Spora patients in a year. Two of the clinicians declined to speak with Insider, and Insider could not reach the rest.Two doctors listed on Spora's website as \"featured Spora providers\" also told Insider that they no longer worked for the startup. The company's founding physician, whose name is signed to an email sent to new members, also no longer works for Spora, two former employees said.Miller said Spora was working to ensure its systems don't show providers who don't have availability or who are no longer with the company. \"Sometimes things, it takes time to get to them with the team that we have right now, the limited team and the limited resources and the folks that we've brought back,\" Miller said. \"But we're working to make sure that we can continue to grow and scale, and also that we continue to provide high-quality care for everyone, but also making sure that the product reflects that.\"One of the former clinicians still listed as taking appointments told Insider that despite starting with the company in mid-2022, she never saw any patients before she was told the company was shutting down at the end of last year.Another former clinician said she only ever treated a handful of Spora patients. \"It wasn't a very busy place,\" she said.Want to tell us about your experience with Spora?

        "Extracted Article": "This latest round of layoff culls the company down to 30 people.The all-cash offers company previously&nbsp;laid off 40% of its employees, in July.This updates Insider's November 19 story about impending staff cuts.Proptech Ribbon laid off about 170 people, or 85% of its remaining staff, on Monday, reducing the startup that helps people make all-cash offers on homes to a shell of its former self, according to a company spokesperson. Company executives sent emails announcing the layoffs to each affected employee this morning.\"After today, Ribbon will be a company of less than 30 people,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. Ribbon employees had been waiting for an update about the cuts since last week, when CEO Shaival Shah told staff that a second and potentially large round of layoffs was imminent. In a November 15 email to employees reviewed by Insider, Shah wrote that the layoffs would be \"deeper\" than the company initially expected, and that severance would \"differ\" from initial plans.The company laid off 139 employees – some 40% of its workforce — this summer, which left the company with around 200 employees on its payroll.Ribbon, founded in 2017 by Shah and chief technology officer Wei Gan, offers software for real estate agents and temporary financing for homebuyers looking to better compete with all-cash offers. Investors like Goldman Sachs and Greylock have provided $900 million in funding since its inception. \"This is a re-balance and the reduction in force is the first and most painful part of that,\" the spokesperson said in the statement.Inman recently reported Ribbon suspended cash offer service.Staff cuts represent just the latest batch of layoffs in the proptech and mortgage sectors, which have been battered in 2022 by soaring interest rates and falling demand. Sales of existing homes in the US declined for the ninth consecutive month in October, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. Among recent layoffs, online brokerage Redfin shut down its iBuying business earlier this month and laid off 862 employees, or 13% of its workforce, after cutting 6% of its workers in June. Meantime, iBuyer Opendoor let 18% of its workforce — some 550 employees — go earlier in the month. Like Ribbon, those companies blamed the cooling housing market and widespread economic uncertainty.Tech company layoffs have ballooned far beyond the niche covered by Ribbon, Opendoor and Redfin, too. Behemoths like Twitter, Amazon and Meta this month axed thousands of jobs, in aggregate, with more likely to come.Shah indicated in last week's email that Ribbon's \"situation has changed considerably\" after talks with Ribbon's funders. He encouraged employees to turn their attention to their \"self care.\" \"During the time of uncertainty, we ask team members who are not customer or finance-facing to shift their focus from their work to self-care, spending time with family and doing things that bring you comfort. We ask that you stay 'on call' in case your support is needed to come to a resolution as quickly as possible,\" he said in the email.Read the rest of Shah's November 15 email here:Team, First and foremost, thank you for your patience through this challenging time for Ribbon. We know this has been an uneasy week and we apologize for sharing this information so late in the day.The company's situation has changed considerably since our last email announcing the upcoming Reduction in Force (RIF). This is primarily due to ongoing discussions with our funding partners.I know we have mentioned this already, but RIF will have to be much deeper based upon the events of the last few months, and the uncertainty of what lies ahead. Business circumstances continue to evolve, and unfortunately severance packages will differ from what we originally believed to be achievable. We sincerely regret having to send you this note and would not be making this change unless it was absolutely necessary. We will have a specific answer and decision to share with everyone on Monday. We know everyone is anxious and we are working with the various counterparts daily. If we were able to finalize sooner, we will certainly share with you earlier.During the time of uncertainty, we ask team members who are not customer or finance-facing to shift their focus from their work to self-care, spending time with family and doing things that bring you comfort. We ask that you stay \"on call\" in case your support is needed to come to a resolution as quickly as possible.This is never where we planned to be or wanted to be. We want to thank you for helping to build something important that has impacted so many people's lives. With Deep Gratitude,Shaival and WeiEditor's note: This story updates an article originally published on November 19 detailing the impending layoffs at Ribbon (November 21)",

The layoffs follow job cuts in June and signal the company sees a housing contraction into 2023. The real-estate company Redfin announced on Wednesday that it would lay off 862 staffers, or 13% of its workforce as it sees the housing contraction lingering into 2023. Of the cuts, 264 of those are related to the company's home-flipping business, RedfinNow, which it will shut down, the company said in a financial filing.An additional 218 staffers will have their roles eliminated, though they're being offered a new role within the company, Redfin said. The announcement comes after Redfin's stock took a nosedive to a record low, after Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein downgraded its stock to underperform and called the business \"fundamentally flawed.\"The company was already feeling the pain of the housing slowdown in June when it saw homebuying demand plunge 17% year-over-year, and cut more than 470 employees in response. Its quarterly loss nearly tripled in the the second quarter to $78.1 million from the same period a year earlier, and was expected to climb again. It reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.In a memo to employees, CEO Glenn Kelman said Redfin's business outlook darkened from just a few months earlier. \"We plan to keep increasing our share of the market, but that market in 2023 is likely to be 30% smaller than it was in 2021,\" Kelman wrote. \"The June layoff was a response to our expectation that we'd sell fewer houses in 2022; this layoff assumes the downturn will last at least through 2023.\"Redfin was one of a handful of companies known as instant buyers, or iBuyers — deep-pocketed tech companies that use algorithms to make quick cash offers to home sellers. The business model, popularized by companies like Zillow and Opendoor, has suffered setbacks recently as companies struggle to offload homes at a profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago, Zillow announced it would be shutting down its own iBuying division and laying off roughly 2,000 people, about a quarter of its workforce. At the time, Zillow estimated that it would be forced to write down as much as $569 million on the thousands of homes on its books.&nbsp; Zillow's home-flipping unit, known as Zillow Offers, had been aggressively bidding on homes in an effort to gain market share and catch up to rival Opendoor, an Insider investigation found. That plan backfired when the company was forced to sell thousands of homes at a loss.",

CloudKitchens,&nbsp;the richly valued startup founded by former Uber chief Travis Kalanick, is cutting jobs as a pandemic-era boom in online food ordering subsidesand a recession looms.&nbsp; The ghost kitchen operator has shed&nbsp;corporate recruiting employees, a move made to get closer to profitability, according to a person close to the matter.On November 1, employees on the recruiting team were asked to attend an impromptu Zoom meeting, described as a \"global update.\" Staff were told to give the meeting priority over other meetings, this person said.&nbsp; David Tunna, head of recruiting, read from a script, according to the person, who witnessed the video call. Tunna said Kalanick's goal is for CloudKitchens&nbsp;to be profitable next year, and with that, the startup has to make some changes, according to the witness.\"We're going to be downsizing. If you're a part of these layoffs, you will meet with your manager and an HR VP sometime today,\" the source recalled Tunna saying.After the speech, which lasted about five minutes, Tunna exited the call. About 10 minutes later, everyone who was going to be laid off that day had another Zoom meeting put on their calendar with their manager and a human resources representative.&nbsp; The source estimated the layoffs impacted about 30 people in the recruiting division. Another person, a current employee of CloudKitchens, confirmed that job cuts have happened. Both people asked not to be identified discussing private matters.&nbsp;CloudKitchens joins many other startups that are eliminating employees as plunging private market valuations put pressure on young businesses to cut costs.

        "Extracted Article": "Insider has learned that InfoSum laid off around 20 staffers earlier this month. Sources said the company had struggled to gain traction in the US and missed revenue targets. InfoSum said the layoffs were due to uncertainty in the macro economy. Data-management company InfoSum had a recent round of layoffs, the company confirmed. The layoffs, which happened this month, come as it faces a gloomy economic outlook and as the company has struggled to hit its revenue targets, according to people familiar with the matter. Founded in the UK in 2016, InfoSum is a software-as-a-service platform that offers companies tools to store and manage their data. It also licences a so-called data bunker that helps advertisers, publishers, and adtech companies co-mingle their data to find customers they have in common, or other insights that can be used for marketing. The data itself is aggregated, cleaned of any identifiable information, and can't be removed from the bunker.The layoffs earlier this month were across areas including engineering and sales, the people familiar with the matter told Insider. Prior to that, the company had clamped down on costs, such as marketing, those people said. Another person familiar with the matter estimated the layoffs hit 12% of Infosum's staff, or about 20 employees.The company's founder, Nicholas Halstead, also left the company this week, according to an announcement on his LinkedIn profile. His post said that he had \"been transitioning out of the company for a while\" and that he planned to spend more time pursuing his motorsport career.\"Due to uncertainty in the macro economy, we recently made the difficult decision to reduce headcount,\" CEO Brian Lesser said in a statement. \"Out of respect for our impacted employees we did not announce these decisions publicly.\" People familiar with the company said InfoSum had struggled to gain traction in the US with a product that was built in the UK, a much smaller market. Companies in Europe — where data-privacy rules like the General Data Protection Regulation, came into force years ago — tend to prioritize privacy more than those in the US, they said.&nbsp;And while InfoSum has boasted impressive case studies from the likes of broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 and the retailer Boots in the UK, it hasn't managed to secure equivalent anchor clients in the US, those people said.&nbsp;The company didn't hit its revenue goal last year and these people said it was unlikely it'd hit its 2022 target either. Lesser said in a statement that InfoSum had doubled the size of its business in the last 18 months and that it planned to double again in the next 12 months. Lesser said the company has more than 100 partners and customers across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia \"including significant anchors.\"Lesser told The Wall Street Journal in August 2021 that the company expected to generate more than $15 million in revenue that year.When Lesser, a former executive of AT&amp;T's ad unit Xandr and ad agency holding company WPP,&nbsp; joined the company's board of directors in 2020, industry observers believed it was to help InfoSum ramp up its business in the US. Lesser became CEO later that year and helped secure its 2021 $65 million Series B financing. At the time, he said the funding — which brought its total investment to around $90 million — would be used to expand internationally and hire across sales, customer relations, operations, and engineering.&nbsp; InfoSum's products compete with similar \"data clean room\" technology from companies like Habu, Snowflake, LiveRamp, and Optable, but the space is still nascent and many marketers have yet to trial the tech. Earlier this month, companies in the space — including InfoSum — launched \"The Clean Room Primer Group,\" to educate marketers on the technology and to work together on industry standards.But convincing marketers to take on extra costs in the face of a recession, when many companies are already trimming their marketing budgets, will be challenging, industry observers told Insider.&nbsp;\"I think it's just hard to get rapid adoption of this new tech, which, candidly, kind of feels like a tax right now because the business model is still evolving,\" said one industry executive. \"Wait, I used to buy ads with all this free data from cookies and [mobile advertising IDs] and now I have to pay just to make the same ad buy I was making a year ago?\"",

London-based carbon accounting startup Emitwise has become the latest to cut jobs. Investors have remained bullish on the sector, with startups raising $13.7 billion up to June. Carbon accounting startup Emitwise has become the latest climate tech startup to lay off staff as the industry jostles with the economic downturn, Insider understands. The London-based startup, which has raised $19.2 million to date, has developed a carbon management platform for manufacturers in the automotive, construction, FMCG, and packaging industries. The company employed 70 people as of October 3.Emitwise declined Insider's request for an interview but confirmed it was \"right-sizing\" the business due to the challenging macro environment. The company did not reveal how many employees had been laid off. Zoomo and Mosa Meat investor ArcTern Ventures is among the company's backers alongside London investor Outsized Ventures.Emitwise joins Berlin-based vertical farming company Infarm in scaling down its workforce. The Atomico and Balderton-backed unicorn laid off 50 employees, or 5% of its headcount in September, Sifted reported.Meanwhile, Bill Gates-backed climate startup Turntide, which is based in California but has a presence in the UK, laid off almost 20% of staff in July – a month after raising $80 million and hitting a $1 billion valuation. The weakened economic outlook has wreaked havoc on the wider tech industry with public companies like Snap forced into bruising layoffs and startups such as Klarna cornered into accepting a markedly reduced valuation.However, climate tech has been somewhat insulated from the market – but \"not 100%,\" according to Helen Lin, partner at At One Ventures.\"Like in any other sector, there are bound to be a certain percentage that struggle,\" she said.&nbsp; Climate tech is wide-ranging, encapsulating everything from research and development-heavy batteries to carbon accounting SaaS tools. Each solution has a varying degree of impact, with many firms using carbon abated or removed as a measurement.&nbsp;Global venture capital pumped into climate startups spiked last year, doubling between 2020 and 2021 to over $30 billion, according to PitchBook.Startups in the sector had raised $13.7 billion up to June 3 this year, down on the $17.9 billion raised in the first half of 2020, its data showed. PitchBook also pointed out that 2021 had featured a \"string of outsized venture deals\" for battery makers Northvolt and SVOLT. Helen Lin, partner at At One Ventures. At One Ventures Trying times may push investors to rethink strategy and prioritize startups driving \"real value,\" Lin said. Related stories \"When the amount of available capital becomes limited in a downturn, it means that capital will generally be prioritized for only the top solutions that feel like they will drive the highest value to the cause,\" she said.In fact, there has been \"phenomenal growth\" across some subsectors, according to Kiko Ventures partner Arne Morteani. \"Crisis creates opportunity and the cost of living crisis highlights just how pressing the development of climate tech and addressing issues around energy supply is,\" he said.The energy crisis has been a boon for home energy startups working on rooftop solar, heat pumps, and smart thermostats. Sharing economy models, such as peer-to-peer sharing and rental models, also help to alleviate problems tied to the cost of living crisis, he said.&nbsp;This is in stark contrast to the decline in climate investing Morteani expected when the energy crisis hit. \"We feared that the world would regress to the times when climate change was seen as a luxury problem,\" he said. \"But quite the opposite happened, which makes us very optimistic.\" At One Ventures' Lin added that in moments of economic difficulty \"sometimes the&nbsp;most interesting innovations are born.\"\"It's like that cliche that necessity is the mother of invention,\" she said.",

HelloFresh and rivals like Blue Apron have struggled with profitability as the public opens back up. The meal-kit maker HelloFresh is laying off over 600 employees and closing a facility in the Bay Area, according to California state records. The company notified 611 workers at its Richmond, California, warehouse on October 10 that it plans to eliminate their roles as of December 11. HelloFresh notified the State of California under the requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.The layoffs are associated with the permanent closure of the facility, according to the notice. The warehouse itself, located at 2041 Factory Street in Richmond, is currently listed for lease, according to PropertyShark.\"The lease for HelloFresh's production facility in Richmond is expiring at the beginning of 2023 and after an extensive analysis of our production network, HelloFresh has decided not to extend the lease,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Insider. The company is focusing on \"newer, more efficient sites,\" and \"profitable growth through strategic investments in infrastructure, technology, and high-efficiency operations.\"\"The decision not to extend the lease is not a reflection of the local teams' performance, and we are grateful for their contributions,\" the spokesperson said about the layoffs. The Richmond facility is one of two warehouses in the US where HelloFresh employees attempted to organize a union last year. The other warehouse that saw a union drive is in Aurora, Colorado.&nbsp;Workers at both facilities voted against creating a union, the industry publication Food Dive reported in December.Like many grocery-delivery players, HelloFresh saw sales rise in the early months of the pandemic. The company ships ingredients and recipes to customers, allowing them to prepare their own meals and hone their cooking skills. HelloFresh has continued to grow sales in 2022 even as rivals such as Imperfect Foods saw their sales fade as pandemic restrictions lifted.But HelloFresh's EBITDA fell nearly 23% in the six months through June 30, according to a recent earnings report. Shares of the Berlin-based company are down roughly 68% so far in 2022, falling farther than the broader market.A rival meal-kit company, Blue Apron, has also seen its shares take a similar dive, falling 67% year-to-date. Last year, HelloFresh started allowing customers to add other grocery items to their regular meal-kit deliveries. Uwe Voss, the US CEO of HelloFresh, told Insider at the time that the company was trying to capture a greater portion of consumers' overall grocery budgets — a tactic that often helps grocers improve their profitability.",

Cannabis tech startup Flowhub has laid off about a dozen employees — or roughly 15% of its workforce, Insider has learned.&nbsp; The layoffs, which occurred in June and early July, were concentrated on the operations side of the company, including employees that worked in sales, partnerships, and customer service, three former employees with knowledge of the layoffs told Insider. The employees requested anonymity to protect future job opportunities in a closely-knit industry.The people told Insider the layoffs were a result of slowing legal cannabis sales in states like Colorado and California, the competitive environment for cannabis tech startups, and the challenging fundraising environment for tech startups more generally.&nbsp; Flowhub confirmed the layoffs to Insider on Friday.\"In July, we restructured the business in light of our new product direction as well as the macro economy in order to ensure longevity as a market leader in the cannabis industry,\" Flowhub VP of Marketing, Anne Fleshman, said in an emailed statement. \"It was a tough decision, but the reality of the current environment required us to re-examine operational costs against future business plans.\"Flowhub, which was founded in 2015, helps cannabis shops track inventory and process sales, among other services. The startup, which is backed by investors including Jay-Z and cannabis-specific funds like Poseidon Asset Management, raised $19 million at a $200 million valuation last October.&nbsp; In 2021, venture investors poured over $3 billion into cannabis startups, propping up valuations and allowing startups to go on hiring sprees, according to the data provider Pitchbook. That number has fallen to under $1 billion as of August 24 this year, per Pitchbook.Flowhub competitor Dutchie — which commanded a $3.75 billion valuation last October — also laid off employees in June. And other cannabis companies, including Eaze, Weedmaps, and Curaleaf have laid off employees in recent weeks and months.",

Over a dozen digital-health startups have conducted layoffs this year as the market tightens. The digital-health startup Wheel cut 17% of its staff on August 18, Insider has learned. In an email sent to Wheel staff on August 18 and shared with Insider, CEO Michelle Davey said the company decided to conduct layoffs in service of its long-term strategy.The Austin, Texas-based startup provides virtual-care infrastructure and a national clinician network to help companies ramp up telehealth services faster and at reduced costs. It's led the pack of startups acting as a backbone for health systems, insurers, and other healthcare companies venturing into virtual care. Davey said the company had planned to move this year from building a marketplace of solutions, like tools for patient messaging, scheduling, and payments,&nbsp;to building its own platform to connect patients with virtual care.By cutting staff, Wheel plans to \"prioritize quality over quantity of our efforts,\" Davey wrote — \"For example, we'll invest more heavily in the platform experience for Wheel clinicians so they can more easily focus on providing great patient care.\"A Wheel spokesperson said the company let go of 35 employees, or 17% of its workforce.

Wheel declined to comment on its valuation.Davey said in the memo that uncertain economic conditions led the startup to accelerate its fundraising timeline to close the round in December, earlier than planned.Over a dozen digital-health startups, from Cedar to Thirty Madison to Ro, have announced layoffs this year as volatile markets lead companies to tighten their belts. Read the full email Davey sent to Wheel staff announcing the layoffs.Hi team — Related stories Today will be a tough day for Wheel. We've made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team and part ways with 35 Wheelies. We wanted to hold true to our commitment to transparency and communicate this as early as possible so that you know what is happening and what to expect next.Within the next 20 minutes, those of you who are leaving Wheel will receive a calendar invite to meet with a senior leader in your department. You'll have the opportunity to learn more about the decision and ask questions in a private conversation. For those who are staying, we'll be gathering as a team at 3 pm CT to discuss this news and our go-forward strategy. You'll receive a calendar invite in the next hour. In the meantime, I wanted to provide more context regarding why we made this decision, how we're taking care of those who are leaving, and how we'll move forward from here.&nbsp;Why we made this decisionFrom the start, our mission has been to put great care within everyone's reach. Over the last few years, we've collectively built a strong business by pairing technology with the leading clinician network for virtual care. We've provided care to millions of people while offering clinicians a new way to work in healthcare.&nbsp; As you know, this year we planned to move from Horizon 1 (building our marketplace) to Horizon 2 (building our enterprise platform). Horizon 2 is the logical next step for our business to unlock more virtual-first care markets and opportunities. By scaling the underlying infrastructure for the industry, we'll accelerate everyone's ability to get quality care on-demand — at any time, from anywhere, and on their own terms.&nbsp;This decision to part ways with some of our teammates wasn't easy and I don't take it lightly. But this was the right decision to make for our long-term success and to accelerate our move into Horizon 2. Just as importantly, it allows us to prioritize quality over quantity of our efforts. For example, we'll invest more heavily in the platform experience for Wheel clinicians&nbsp;so they can more easily focus on providing great patient care.Additionally, as we've discussed as a team, we've been proactively planning for an uncertain economy so that we're prepared to execute with focus and adjust as needed. That includes accelerating our fundraising timeline to close our Series C last December. Together, these actions give us the stability to achieve our strategic goals and solidify our position as the clear market leader as we navigate market conditions and industry dynamics. How are we supporting those who are leaving us?We value the contributions of the Wheelies leaving us today. Because of their commitment to Wheel and our mission, we've made great strides through Horizon 1 as we built our marketplace. I want to express my gratitude for their contributions, which is why we're prioritizing putting them in the best position possible by offering a comprehensive severance package.How will we move forward? For those who are leaving, I'm incredibly grateful for the role each of you has played in Wheel's journey.&nbsp;For those who are staying, you'll be hearing from your team leads later this morning. In addition to meeting as a company at 3 pm CT, next week we'll discuss our go-forward plans more extensively, including our product strategy, in our All Hands on Tuesday the 23rd. I know this is a lot to process so please take the time you need to take care of yourself and prioritize your wellbeing.&nbsp;And for everyone, I can't say thank you enough for your commitment to our mission of putting great care within everyone's reach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,Michelle&nbsp;",

Softbank-backed adtech company Permutive has laid off 30 staffers, around 15% of its headcount, Insider has learned. The layoffs hit various divisions, including engineering, marketing, and talent.\"We made redundancies where we had over-hired, with varying levels of reductions by teams and departments,\" Permutive CEO Joe Root wrote in a blog post that was published after Insider requested comment from the company. \"Some teams were more heavily affected than others — that was not a reflection of their importance or contribution to the company, but rather a case of having over-hired ahead of revenue.\" Root said the company paused hiring in June amid concerns about the economy's impact on advertising spending and venture capital.\"Big tech companies like Google and Facebook started freezing hiring in response to slowing ad spend, which was a leading indicator that forecasting where advertisers spend would get measurably harder and unpredictable in the coming months,\" Root wrote in the post.It's the latest in a string of layoffs to hit the tech industry. More than 30,000 tech employees lost their jobs in July. In adtech in particular, companies from Oracle to AppLovin have cut staff as marketers have trimmed their spending amid a softening economy. Founded in the UK in 2015, Permutive provides software that publishers like Insider, The Guardian, and Condé Nast use to turn their audience data into desirable segments for advertisers to target.&nbsp;It also offers a \"clean room\" function that lets publishers and advertisers match their data, without information on individual users leaving the platform — a technology that has grown in popularity in recent years as the ad industry has moved to more privacy-focused adtech.Permutive has raised $105 million in funding to date. Its latest round last year was led by SoftBank through its Vision Fund 2, with existing investors EQT Ventures, Octopus Ventures, and Ace &amp; Company also participating. At the time of the raise, Permutive CEO Joe Root said the company wanted to use the fresh funds to double its then-140-person staffand expand into the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions over the next couple of years.SoftBank this week posted a $21.68 billion loss for its Vision Fund in the second quarter of this year, having been hit by the recent stock market slump. SoftBank has said it also may need to \"dramatically\" reduce headcount at its Vision Fund. At least 10 companies backed by SoftBank have had layoffs so far this year.",

Slync's board fired Chris Kirchner, the startup's globe-trotting CEO and cofounder. Slync.io, the Goldman Sachs-backed supply-chain tech startup that failed to pay employees in full for almost three months, laid off some staff Friday, said two affected employees and two former employees with contacts inside the company.&nbsp; Slync's board has also terminated Chris Kirchner, the company's CEO and cofounder, and removed him from the board, after suspending him last week.

They said they stayed with the company despite the payroll issues because they believed Kehoe and Kirchner's explanations from May and June, that a locked-up investment froze the company's cash flow.&nbsp; Friday's layoffs affected employees across departments and appeared to affect those who had questioned management about the payroll issues on Slack, the same laid-off employee said.&nbsp;\"All the people who questioned the management were laid off,\" the affected employee said.&nbsp;White confirmed in a statement that the board fired Kirchner, but he declined to answer Insider's questions regarding the departments affected, the severance offered, or how laid-off employees were selected. Since Insider and other media outlets began reporting on Slync's failure to pay employees in June, management has locked several employees out of the company email and Slack without formally terminating them, current and former employees said. At least one of these people was also laid off on Friday, the affected employee told Insider.&nbsp;\"Now that this chapter in Slync's history is closed, we must collectively focus on the future and continue to deliver value to our customers with our world-class software,\" Kehoe wrote to employees in the Friday-morning email announcing Kirchner's termination.&nbsp;Here's the full note Kehoe sent to Slync staff:&nbsp; Team Slync,&nbsp;I know the past two months have been extremely difficult for every one of you and your families. Missing payroll and the lack of truthful communications surrounding those payrolls was completely unacceptable, you deserve better. However, thanks to the tremendous support of our board of directors and current investors, all the payrolls have gone out and those days are behind us. Additionally, the Slync Board of Directors took decisive action this week to terminate Chris as the CEO and as an employee of the company. In conjunction with the board's actions to suspend and ultimately remove the CEO, the board has entrusted me as the interim president to lead us through this time of transition and I'm humbled to have the opportunity.&nbsp;Now that this chapter in Slync's history is closed, we must collectively focus on the future and continue to deliver value to our customers with our world-class software.&nbsp; Very Respectfully,&nbsp;Tim",

        "Extracted Article": "Cannabis-tech firm Weedmaps laid off 10% of employees, per an August 4 memo. The company's stock has suffered this year, falling over 55%. Cannabis is far from recession-proof, as Weedmaps' recent layoffs show.&nbsp; Layoffs have already come for tech. Now, they're coming for cannabis too. Cannabis-tech firm Weedmaps is cutting 10% of its workforce, Insider has learned. The company had 606 full-time workers at the end of 2021. In an email dated August 4 that was obtained by Insider, CEO Chris Beals cited a slowdown in legal cannabis sales in states like Colorado and California, the rising price of gas, and broader economic conditions that point to a coming recession.\"There are certainly lessons I will learn from this, and we will continue to do the best we can to grow and guide the business for employees, clients and investors. In regard to the slowdown of end markets, I was wrong in predicting that this would bottom out at the start of the year and that we would start to see a recovery,\" Beals wrote. A Weedmaps spokesperson confirmed the layoffs to Insider. In a follow-up statement, Beals said that given the macroeconomic challenges, the \"prudent approach was to plan more conservatively for the coming quarters.\"\"Though difficult, we believe this restructure better positions the company to weather end market turbulence and operate profitably in the second half of the year,\" Beals said in the statement.Weedmaps&nbsp;lists recreational and medical cannabis shops on its site, allowing consumers to browse dispensaries and see reviews of marijuana products. It also provides a way for cannabis businesses to engage with customers and market products. The layoffs point to coming troubles in the cannabis industry, which has proven to be far from recession-proof as some commentators have suggested.&nbsp;Like many other publicly traded cannabis companies, Weedmaps stock has suffered this year. Nasdaq-listed shares have dropped over 55% this year, as legal cannabis sales have slowed and broader economic shocks have hit the market.Weedmaps was also the subject of a pair of July complaints that alleged the firm was listing illegal marijuana products and shops on its platform, as Marijuana Business Daily reported. Read the full memo from Weedmaps CEO Chris Beals here:Dear Weedmappers:This is a tough email to write. As many of you have heard by now, we made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team by about 10% today. The impacts were distributed fairly evenly across teams in the company and were focused on areas where we felt we could achieve our same level of growth even with the reduction in staff. As part of this, we have also moved to centralize certain functions across the company and cut costs that weren't directly driving the growth of the marketplace, driving revenue or increasing product adoption.By many measures, our growth for the last few quarters has been strong, and we outpaced the growth of legal cannabis markets by a significant margin. We have also been conducting active, ongoing rationalization of investment areas (e.g Weedmaps Exchange, Weedmaps Retail).&nbsp; Unfortunately, the confluence of several factors have created a set of headwinds that lead me to believe we need to be conservative with our spending in the immediate future. These factors include:• Several of the cannabis end-markets have actually contracted over the last few quarters, notably California (-12% y/y), Oklahoma (-21% y/y) and Colorado (-17% y/y), each which have experienced meaningful slowdown in legal cannabis sales.• The rapid increase in gas prices put heavy pressure on delivery operators and left them with less money to spend on marketing and customer acquisition on platforms like WM.• I have increasingly come to believe that we are facing a high probability of recession and there is just a broad deterioration in the macro environment. This means we need to position ourselves to weather a potentially protracted storm to be well positioned for potential worsening of consumer demand.&nbsp;There are certainly lessons I will learn from this, and we will continue to do the best we can to grow and guide the business for employees, clients and investors. In regard to the slowdown of end markets, I was wrong in predicting that this would bottom out at the start of the year and that we would start to see a recovery.&nbsp; Instead, we saw the combination of consumers feeling a recessionary pinch in their wallet running up against retailers that were holding prices steady despite falling wholesale prices.&nbsp; In time, more licenses, lower taxes and better retailer pricing will help solve that, but that still needs to happen.I can't express enough the gratitude I have for the contributions of those we had to part ways with today, and as we come out on the other side of this turbulence, we would very much like to find ways to bring teammates back to the company.For those of us who are continuing with WM, I know today's news is painful and scary. While I can assure you that a lot of thought went into how to save costs and better streamline our teams, it doesn't lessen the sting. Please know that we sized these cost reductions at a level to help ensure we had a buffer against further market deterioration so that we could provide better stability on the path forward. We have now put ourselves in a better position to grow and do so profitably. The future continues to get brighter for cannabis legalization, and the growth opportunity for Weedmaps is outsized with new cannabis markets and new cannabis licenses ahead. This means that we need to pull together and focus on delivering the right solutions that clients need at a very rapid pace. For those of you that are ready to run fast and build something great, we can truly revolutionize this industry, and I look forward to building that future together.All of the executive team and managers will be organizing team meetings throughout the day, and we will provide more color at our upcoming all-hands.Thanks,ChrisIf you have a tip or were affected by recent layoffs in the cannabis industry, reach out to this reporter via email (jberke@businessinsider.com), Twitter direct message (@jfberke), or LinkedIn.

The company confirmed to Insider that it laid off on August 2 a \"small\" number of US staff.&nbsp; The CEO said in a memo that FuboTV will focus more on \"fewer priorities\" and \"profitable growth.\" FuboTV has laid off a number of staffers in the US, the streaming-TV company confirmed to Insider.&nbsp; The company said in a statement that it made on August 2 a \"small workforce reduction\" in light of the economic downturn.The statement said: \"The quickly deteriorating macroeconomic environment, coupled with the increasing level of uncertainty, is impacting all companies. FuboTV continues to focus on cost savings and taking a conservative approach to growth. As part of this, the company made a small workforce reduction across its U.S. business today. While not welcome, this reduction is an opportunity for Fubo to re-examine key initiatives and focus on profitable growth in support of its long-term vision.\"FuboTV told staff about the layoffs in a memo from CEO David Gandler that was viewed by Insider. Impacted employees would be invited by 10 a.m. EST on August 2 to meet with management and the layoffs would be effective August 15, according to the memo.\"To support the long term vision and ensure financial flexibility for the company, we have made the very difficult decision to reduce headcount across U.S. domestic business units,\" Gandler said in the memo. The layoffs come as FuboTV is scheduled to report its Q2 financial results on Thursday after market close.The sports-focused pay-TV and gambling operator went public in 2020. It had a divisive run as a meme-stock from late 2020 to 2021, after revealing plans to expand into the red-hot sports betting sector. But the company is not yet profitable and Wall Street has been harsh to both media and sports stocks without a healthy bottom line amid the economic downturn.FuboTV ended 2021 with $638 million in revenue, a 144% increase from the year before, driven by its pay-TV subscriptions and advertising. And it narrowed its net loss 37% year over year to about $383 million. But the streaming company's net loss then doubled year over year during Q1 to $140.8 million, on $242 million in revenue.Shares of FuboTV opened at $2.46 on the morning of August 2, down roughly 80% year to date, compared with the S&amp;P 500's 14% dip during that time.\"While we certainly don't welcome these cuts, this is an opportunity to re-examine our initiatives, double down on our priorities and focus on profitable growth,\" Gandler said in the memo. \"By focusing more on fewer priorities, and with everyone stepping up to the challenge, we must increase our productivity on what truly moves the needle for the company.\" Read the full memo that FuboTV sent to staff:Subject: Organizational UpdateTeam, While FuboTV was founded on an idea - to give consumers access to global sports content streamed through a premium user experience at a fair price - Alberto and I, alongside our co-founder Sung Ho Choi, could never have made it a reality without the perseverance and drive of many dedicated, hard-working and talented people. We have always been grateful that you have supported our vision from the very beginning.Because we have achieved many things together, I always want to be transparent with you. So, it is with a heavy heart that I communicate some bad news today.As you know, all growth stage companies, and the broader tech sector overall, have been facing financial challenges due to macroeconomic concerns and an increasing level of uncertainty. Fubo is unfortunately not immune. We have worked hard over the last few months to achieve cost savings by cutting unnecessary expenses across the company but, regrettably, we need to do more. To support the long term vision and ensure financial flexibility for the company, we have made the very difficult decision to reduce headcount across U.S. domestic business units. Employees impacted by the reduction will receive an invitation by 10am ET today to meet with management, and will transition from the company effective August 15. Please support your colleagues in this transition. I am here to help them in any way I can.I want to be clear that this reduction is not reflective of individual performance. We made these changes today solely to ensure the company is stronger from a financial perspective and to support our path to profitability. Various factors were considered when deciding who would be impacted by this reorganization. There are no further reductions planned at this time.This has been an extremely difficult decision made by myself and the senior leadership team. I have always been proud that we have never previously initiated any layoffs at Fubo. I always found a way for Fubo to persevere despite any financial challenges we faced. However, it is no longer my decision alone. There are a significant number of external forces at play here now that we are a public company. Senior leaders will meet with their teams today and, in the upcoming days, they will further take their teams through the organizational changes and team realignments. They will set forth very focused efforts around key organizational priorities. I am also here to help you in any way I can during this process.While we certainly don't welcome these cuts, this is an opportunity to re-examine our initiatives, double down on our priorities and focus on profitable growth. By focusing more on fewer priorities, and with everyone stepping up to the challenge, we must increase our productivity on what truly moves the needle for the company. We need to make sure that Fubo is still the innovative, fast-moving and nimble organization that we were at the beginning, always operating with a clear sense of urgency to deliver on our goals.Our direction remains clear: providing our customers with a best-in-class user experience that allows them to enjoy and interact with aggregated sports, news and entertainment content. I have no doubt that we can achieve this if we work together and commit to executing on our goals. I look forward to doing this with you. I will host a meeting on Wednesday for U.S. employees only to answer any questions.DavidGot a tip about FuboTV?

The platform is the latest creator economy company to conduct layoffs. OnlyFans, the subscription service famous for its adult content, has laid off employees as part of a move to \"reshape certain teams,\" the company said in a statement to Insider. OnlyFans did not specify how many employees were laid off or which divisions were affected.\"While this is the right decision for OnlyFans and our Creator community, we recognize it is difficult for the people who were impacted by this decision,\" the statement said. \"Affected employees have been provided with a generous severance package and career counseling to support their transition period.\" OnlyFans use skyrocketed during the pandemic, when it entered the zeitgeist and even found its way into a Beyoncé song.Per the company's 2021 financial filings — the most recent available — the number of creators on the app grew from 348,000 in 2019 to 1,618,000 in 2020, and the number of \"fans\" grew from 13,478,000 to 82,308,000. Revenue grew from about £44,164,000 (about $53.7 million) in 2019 to about £283,467,000 (about $345 million) in 2020.The platform has become a lucrative way for many creators to make money. Some adult content creators have earned millions of dollars from subscribers who pay to get access to their photos and videos, as well as to message the creators and receive custom content. In late 2021, the company had a sudden change of leadership, when founder Tim Stokely stepped down as CEO, and Ami Gan, the company's former PR and marketing chief, was named CEO. Stokely and his family had sold the majority of the company to billionaire Leonid Radvinsky in 2018.While other media companies, like Netflix and Roku, have been hit with slowdowns after thriving during the early months of the pandemic, OnlyFans execs said in June that the company had avoided such a downturn.\"We're not experiencing that slowdown,\" Keily Blair, OnlyFans' chief strategy and operations officer, said at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam, CNBC reported. At the same conference, the company's chief financial officer, Lee Taylor, said that the company was increasing its team by 2% to 3% each month. He specifically called out the UK office, saying, \"We are building a team in the UK to help our creators maximize their earnings.\"Currently, however, the company only has one open job listing on LinkedIn, and it is in the US. It did not appear to have job openings listed on its website or other popular job platforms, like Indeed.com.Here is the full statement from OnlyFans on the layoffs: \"OnlyFans regularly reviews our internal structure to ensure we are Creator first in everything we do. As the number of Creators on OnlyFans continues to grow, we recently elected to reshape certain teams to better address the needs of our Creator community. While this is the right decision for OnlyFans and our Creator community, we recognize it is difficult for the people who were impacted by this decision. Affected employees have been provided with a generous severance package and career counseling to support their transition period.\"If you have been affected by layoffs at OnlyFans or have more information, please reach out at Mberg@businessinsider.com.",

It got a massive business bump earlier in the pandemic but, like many peers, has slowed in 2022. Boosted has raised $380 million in outside funding to date, according to Marketplace Pulse. The Los Angeles Amazon-brand aggregator Boosted Commerce has laid off about 5% of its employees, a person familiar with the matter told Insider.The news comes as several other Amazon aggregators have cut staff since spring, with companies like Suma,&nbsp;Heroes, and the industry heavyweight Thrasio announcing significant staff cuts since April as the sector moves toward consolidation.&nbsp; A Boosted Commerce employee who was laid off earlier this year told Insider several of the employees affected by the latest round of layoffs were \"VP and director level\" and that brand and marketing departments were hit the hardest. The former employee was granted anonymity because they signed a nondisclosure agreement, but their identity is known to Insider.\"Over the past two years, we have acquired 40 businesses and are continuing to look at how to resource to best manage growth across our portfolio,\" Boosted Commerce CEO Keith Richman said in a statement to Insider. \"In examining our second-half initiatives, we decided it would make sense to reallocate investment into different resource buckets. We continue to hire for those roles and areas related to those investments.\" Amazon aggregators were tempting targets for investors and private-equity firms in 2020 and 2021 as e-commerce growth skyrocketed. Aggregators acquire already profitable brands on Amazon and then attempt to optimize them to increase margins. But the market has soured on aggregators as the underlying business model comes into question, with funding for aggregators down 60% in the first half of 2022, according to Marketplace Pulse.A spokesperson for Boosted Commerce said the aggregator continued to acquire brands and that the company was far from struggling, adding that Boosted had hired a new chief financial officer, Martin Dunstheimer, at the end of June.&nbsp;Boosted has raised $380 million in outside funding to date, according to Marketplace Pulse.",

        "Extracted Article": "Lunchbox offers digital ordering, loyalty, and marketing services for restaurants. The startup is led by industry provocateur Nabeel Alamgir, who got his start as a New York busboy.&nbsp; On Thursday, the CEO told Insider that the company had grown \"bloated\" and had to cut 60 employees. Lunchbox, a New York-based food-tech startup whose CEO is known for speaking against the anti-restaurant tactics of delivery apps like Grubhub and DoorDash, laid off 33% of its employees Thursday. The company, which has raised $72 million in less than three years, went from 180 to 120 full-time employees on Thursday. One-third were notified in a Zoom call. The other 40 workers were sent messages to their personal emails,&nbsp;Lunchbox CEO and cofounder Nabeel Alamgir told Insider late Thursday.The layoffs come as food tech investors pressure well-funded startups to trim bloated operations amid turmoil in the capital markets.&nbsp; \"We are all drunk on VC capital, and we needed to sober up,\" Alamgir told Insider.&nbsp;Other food-tech companies downsizing workforces and shoring up operations include&nbsp;Nextbite,&nbsp;ChowNow,&nbsp;Reef Technology,&nbsp;Gopuff, and&nbsp;Sunday. SoftBank backs many of these startups.Alamgir&nbsp;said Lunchbox, like other VC-backed companies, had grown too quickly. He said the layoffs hit all divisions, especially engineers and tech roles. Over the last few months, Lunchbox has acquired companies such as Delish and NovaDine to help automate restaurant onboarding. The CEO said that Lunchbox could operate with a much leaner staff now.&nbsp;\"We were all bloated,\" Alamgir told Insider. \"We no longer are growth at all costs. I'm no longer going to be dependent on investors. We're now working towards being in cash positive.\"Two former employees, one who was laid off from the company this week, said the company spent excessively on marketing and promotional materials such as opening a restaurant in the metaverse and holding its own conferences called Lunchbox Roadshows.\"I think the combination of the industry, seeing reductions, and then just the fiscal behavior of the company, like Nabeel especially, is incredibly irresponsible with his money. He spends everything on brand and marketing and, and cool-looking things and does not spend anything on the product.\" Alamgir said the company's marketing spend was aimed at giving the startup&nbsp; \"a strong brand voice\" amid a slew of competition.\"Excess marketing spend has not been our issue; overhiring throughout the company and being drunk with my peers on VC money has been,\" he said.Alamgir, whose company is entirely remote, said he has Zoom calls set for Friday and the weekend to talk to those who were notified of their job loss by email. He said the company is investing $700,000 in severance packages, and he's personally trying to find jobs for those who got cut.\"It still feels like crap. I'm responsible for a lot of people, and I'm gonna get to have to sleep tonight knowing that.\" Nabeel Alamgir is the CEO of Lunchbox. He laid off 60 people on this birthday - Thursday, July 21, 2022. Lunchbox Well before the coronavirus pandemic swept the nation in March 2020, restaurant operators began sounding the alarm about the economic hardships they face when working with third-party delivery apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alamgir, then a marketing chief at Bareburger, often screamed the loudest. He left Bareburger to start Lunchbox in 2019 to erase what he called \"injustices\" restaurants faced at the hands of delivery apps. Alamgir said it's always been his mission to help mom-and-pop restaurants reduce their dependence on third-party delivery companies.&nbsp;Besides offering online restaurant ordering, Lunchbox's services include loyalty and marketing programs for brands like Mexicue, Fuku, and Bareburger. Last year, Lunchbox launched a&nbsp;NotGrubhub website to promote direct orders from New York restaurants. It also introduced Citizens Go, an online ordering app for virtual brand company C3.&nbsp;However, LunchBox was seeing churn inside the company, former employees said. Restaurants were leaving the startup, including the prominent virtual brand company Virtual Dining Concepts. \"We were shown a scorecard last week during an all-hands that basically said we weren't meeting any goals,\" an employee who was laid off from the company told Insider. Last year,&nbsp;Insider named him among 33 restaurant tech power players. Today, Lunchbox works with nearly 4,000 restaurants and still plans to grow through acquisitions, Alamgir said.In June, Lunchbox began offering its basic online ordering software for free to mom-and-pop restaurants. Despite today's layoffs, that free offer remains, Alamgir said. \"Restaurants need it now more than ever.\"Kristen Hawley contributed to this reporting.&nbsp; This piece has been updated to include comments from former employees.",

The company confirmed the job cuts to Insider on Monday.&nbsp; The company is one of several to initiate a round of layoffs amid fears the US is entering a recession. Vimeo is conducting layoffs, a company spokesperson confirmed to Insider on Monday. Vimeo CEO Anijali Sud said the layoffs would impact 6% of the company's workforce in a blog post on Monday. The company employed just over 1,200 workers as of December 2021, according to its annual regulatory filing.&nbsp;\"We are making this decision in order to ensure we come out of this economic downturn a stronger company,\" she said in the post. \"Our people are what makes Vimeo great, and losing any of them is a personal failure that I feel deeply. But after assessing the challenging market conditions and uncertainty ahead, I believe this is the responsible action to take.\" An employee, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said they learned that they were being laid off through a Zoom meeting with an HR representative and their manager. The employee was told the layoffs are effective immediately and access to work systems would be cut off by the end of the day, according to an email obtained by Insider.The individual told Insider that numerous employees had been notified they were being terminated via one-on-one meetings, as well as some group Zoom meetings.Vimeo is one of many tech companies that are downsizing their workforce amid fears that the US is on the brink of a recession. Last month, Elon Musk said Tesla plans to lay off 10% of its salaried workforce. Coinbase laid off 1,100 employees or about 18% of its staff in June. Meanwhile, Meta slowed hiring in May and has reportedly warned some staff that cutbacks are coming.Vimeo went public on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2021.&nbsp; The company's main business is software as a service that makes it easier for the average person to create and distribute video content; it's recently been shifting to big corporate clients like Gap, Nike, and Expedia and away from its role as a YouTube alternative.\"Today we are a technology platform, not a viewing destination. We are a B2B solution, not the indie version of YouTube,\" its CEO Anjali Sud wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier this year. As part of that strategy shift, Vimeo notified independent video creators it was sharply increasing the cost of its services, leaving some scrambling for alternatives.Anjali acknowledged the company had some stumbles earlier in its B2B transition but that the problems were fixable through better execution in 2022. She also predicted the company's growth would slow in 2022 as Vimeo transitions to focusing on bigger companies.Have a tip or more information about this story?

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon aggregator startup Heroes quietly cut a fifth of its staff in May, Insider understands. The London-based firm, founded in 2020, acquires and scales top sellers on Amazon. Heroes cited market conditions and potential difficulty raising capital as reasons behind the cuts. Amazon aggregator startup Heroes, which has raised over $300 million in two years, quietly laid off a fifth of its staff in May as the nascent industry attempts to shift from hypergrowth to profitability. Aggregators, or rollups, acquire third-party brands that rely on Amazon infrastructure to store, process, and ship out products. London-based Heroes, founded by brothers Riccardo, Alessio, and Giancarlo Bruni in 2020, joined a bevy of these newly-spawned companies trying to capitalize on an ecommerce boom fueled by the pandemic.The ballooning sector has attracted $15 billion in funding since March 2020, when lockdowns drove a surge in online shopping.&nbsp;Heroes' backers include Cray hill Capital Management, 360 Capital, Fuel Ventures, and Upper 90. The company faces competition from London-based Olsam and Berlin-based firms SellerX and Razor. Heroes cofounder Riccardo Bruni informed staff on May 30 that 20% of the company's 120-strong workforce would be cut, Insider understands. Bruni cited challenging market conditions, a potential global recession, the consequent shift in consumer spending, and potential difficulty raising future capital as the driving forces behind the cuts during a 10am meeting.In a follow-up email seen by Insider, Bruni said the company had come to the \"hard decision\" to restructure the business and reduce its workforce in order to help it become a \"cash-flow positive business.\" He also said the company was \"unfortunately dependent\" on the flow of external capital to enable them to acquire more sellers.The move to slash up to 24 jobs at Heroes was sudden, according to a source familiar with the situation, who said the company had still been focused on growth during an all-hands meeting in April. Heroes had just acquired its first brand with substantial traction off Amazon, which was in bricks and mortar stores, a goal previously made clear by the company. Bruni confirmed the cuts in an interview Friday with Insider. He said the company hired 12 to 18 months in advance and that the slowdown meant Heroes was overstaffed. Layoffs were company-wide but the investment team, which sources deals and acquisitions, was particularly hard hit. Up to five people from a team of 10 lost their job, Bruni said.Those being made redundant were invited to a 1:1 session within half an hour of the cuts being announced. Two to four people were offered different roles within the company when there was a fit, Bruni said. The others being made redundant were instantly cut off from the company's IT and placed on gardening leave – per advice from a HR consultancy, Bruni added.&nbsp;The Heroes cofounder said the decision to cut staff was not a result of investor pressure and that the people who were let go had \"immensely contributed\" to the startup's success to date. \"But, as a business, we also have a fiduciary duty towards our investors, who trust us as management to take the right decisions,\" he said. \"We felt it was the right decision to go through this round of redundancies and right-size the business.\"Bruni said that no further cuts will be made at Heroes but predicted layoffs across the wider tech ecosystem.\"My view is that we're just seeing the very, very beginning of mass layoffs across the entire industry,\" he said. \"And I'm not talking about the FBA aggregator space but about the industry as an economy as a whole.\" Like other aggregator businesses, Heroes is largely funded by debt. It raised an undisclosed sum in February, according to PitchBook. US heavy hitter Thrasio, which pioneered the business model and has raised a total of $3.4 billion, also announced layoffs in May.Do you work at an aggregator? Got a tip?

The company, which helps creators make and sell merch, has raised $60 million. Spring, the merchandise company formerly known as Teespring, is the latest creator economy startup to lay off employees.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the company laid off a number of staffers across its growth, marketing, and other teams, including some high-level execs, according to multiple people close to the company. Spring confirmed the layoffs to Insider, but did not comment on how many employees were affected.\"Today, we announced a plan to streamline parts of our business saying goodbye to some team members and legacy business functions,\" Chris Lamontagne, CEO of Spring, said in a statement. \"Going forward we are focusing singularly on building the best creator-facing product to create, sell, and fulfill their products to fans. In the current climate, we believe more than ever in our purpose to help individual creators thrive in doing what they love.\" \"It was very swift,\" said one former staffer who was laid off on Tuesday. \"Most of us lost immediate access to Slack.\"Six former staffers, who spoke with Insider on the condition of anonymity to protect career prospects, said they felt the business was facing challenges beyond simply the current economic downturn. Their identities are known to Insider.&nbsp;\"The company, over the last three months, has gone a bunch of different directions,\" said a second former employee laid off this week. \"Doesn't seem like there is sort of a grand vision. It's been a little chaotic.\" \"With the latest layoffs impacting all creator-facing departments ... it's hard to see how Spring can claim itself to be The&nbsp;creator company,\" said a third former employee laid off this week.The San Francisco-based company launched in 2011 as a platform where users could create T-shirts. By 2018, it had begun to focus on making merch for content creators like YouTube stars. The company helps creators with production and distribution, and it has built partnerships with platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram — as well as other creator economy startups like Linktree and Pietra.&nbsp;In partnership with YouTube, Spring created a \"merch shelf\" feature that lets creators sell merchandise directly below their videos. Spring also has an in-app integration on TikTok for creators to sell their merch directly on the platform. Spring had raised a total of $60 million in funding to date, according to Pitchbook data. Lamontagne told the Information in September 2021 that Spring was eyeing an IPO \"within the next 18 to 24 months.\" At that time, The Information reported that Spring had 450 employees.Earlier this year, Spring poached Meta VP Annelies Jansen to serve as president and COO.Spring is among a slew of other&nbsp;creator economy startups that have laid off employees in the last three months, including Cameo, Jellysmack, and Lightricks.",

The startup said it had made the \"very difficult decision\" given the current macroeconomic climate. Insider reported that the company was set to lay off staff previously.&nbsp; Virtual events startup Hopin, which was valued at $7.75 billion during the pandemic, is laying off 242 of its staff in its second wave of job cuts in 2022, confirming earlier reporting from Insider. The cuts equate to around 29% of the company's workforce. Hopin said it had made the \"very difficult decision\" due to the current macroeconomic climate and the need for its events product to \"move forward efficiently.\"\"We're extremely grateful for our departing colleagues and friends and will always appreciate their talent, contributions and impact on Hopin,\" a company spokesman said. \"While we took preventative measures before looking at a more significant restructure, it became necessary to simplify our events business and supporting operations to build a profitable and sustainable company. Hopin's mission has always been to build technology that better connects people, and these changes were made so we can focus on this now more than ever.\"Founded in 2019 by 28-year-old British entrepreneur Johnny Boufarhat, UK-based Hopin offers conferencing software for virtual and hybrid events, with its paid plans ranging from $99 to $799 per month or higher. The firm grew quickly during the pandemic, and attracted $1 billion in venture capital funding from backers on the hunt for future \"winners\" of hybrid work.But this February, Hopin announced it was cutting 12% of staff — around 138 people — citing the need for sustainable growth. The company told Insider that those impacted will receive three months of compensation and health benefits and their one-year cliff dropped for stock vesting.&nbsp; The firm employs around 834 people.The cuts come amid a broader cooling in interest in high-risk startups and tech firms. European firms including fast-delivery firm Gorillas, rival Getir, car sales platform Cazoo, and others have all cut jobs in recent months.Hopin faces an additional challenge in the world returning to real-world events, and a possible dropoff in demand for its services.&nbsp;When the startup&nbsp;raised a big $450 million round in August last year, the startup&nbsp;had&nbsp;approximately $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), and around 800 employees. It also claimed to be hosting around 15,000 events a month on its platform.&nbsp;But currently there are just&nbsp;158 events listed for the month of July and 54 for August. Hopin is backed by major investors like General Catalyst, Tiger Global, Coatue, Accel, and IVP. Its young founder and CEO Boufarhat switched his residency to Switzerland weeks shortly before the last set of job cuts. A paper billionaire thanks to Hopin's multibillion-dollar valuation, he has cemented his wealth by selling $195 million of his own shares.The firm remains privately held. According to data from Zanbato, a platform for trading private shares, the market price for Hopin's shares fell 57% during the first half of 2022.",

The funding boosted Cedar's valuation to $3.2 billion.Cedar said in May that it was moving headquarters to a different New York City building to give its employees more flexibility and amenities.\"In addition to expanding our footprint last year to San Francisco and Salt Lake City after our acquisition of Ooda Health, this move is reflective of our strategic growth and commitment to investing in our current workforce,\" Otto said in a statement about the move. The announcement follows a slew of layoffs by digital health unicorns announced in recent months, including players like direct-to-consumer startup Ro and primary-care provider Carbon Health. Like Cedar, many of the startups have raked in hundreds of millions in venture capital over the past two years.&nbsp;",

Canoo said the moves are a natural step as it moves toward production, but employees aren't so sure. Electric-vehicle startup Canoo has laid off some workers this year as its deadline for starting vehicle production approaches, six sources familiar with the changes told Insider. A company spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and said the move is part of Canoo's strategy to execute its plans, but employees impacted say uncertainty is brewing. The spokesperson said Canoo has let 58 employees go this year, which is about 6% of its approximate 940-person headcount. The spokesperson also said 313 employees have been hired this year, and that it is still hiring.Canoo has cut personnel in areas like talent sourcing and acquisition, marketing, brand design, and engineering, according to current and former employees with direct knowledge of the situation, along with LinkedIn posts from those who say they've been laid off.&nbsp; Sources were granted anonymity, as they are bound by NDAs or are unauthorized to speak publicly about the company. Their identities are known to Insider.The company has also been shifting and reorganizing some of its remaining workforce to prioritize manufacturing and production-focused roles.&nbsp;\"We are a performance-based culture and make decisions appropriate to the times and the needs of the company, to execute our plans,\" the company spokesperson said. Canoo is in the process of relocating its headquarters from California to Bentonville, Arkansas, where it says it plans to start production of its flagship \"lifestyle vehicles\" this year. But the Arkansas factory is not yet set up for mass production, sources say. During Canoo's last earnings call, CEO Tony Aquila referred to this year's production guidance and said \"Whether we will hit our full target of 3,000 units to 6,000 units is still remaining open.\"Canoo also originally targeted production at its other US-based manufacturing plant, in Pryor, Oklahoma, starting late 2023.Aquila told Reuters in May that the company may see a delay in the start of vehicle production in Arkansas from the fourth quarter this year to the start of 2023, and that the start of production in Oklahoma could slip into 2024. A recent report from local paper Tulsa World said those plans are on hold, citing a local official.&nbsp; The reality of the difficulty of making that many vehicles by late this year is setting in, sources told Insider.\"It was chaotic to say the least,\" an employee who says they were just terminated from the company told Insider.The startup has also lost top talent and sources allege it missed supplier payments this year. Meanwhile, its stock price has dropped 90% from an all-time high of $22 in December 2020 to around $2. Canoo reported a \"going concern\" statement about its financial viability at the end of the first-quarter but announced a new plan to raise much-needed capital, including $50 million in funding via a committed private investment in public equity from Aquila's firm, Aquila Family Ventures, and a $250 million equity purchase agreement with financing partner Yorkville Advisors. The plan also included filing a $300 million universal shelf registration, allowing the company to issue securities like common stock in the future.The company's burn rate is more than $100 million a quarter.&nbsp;Are you a current or former Canoo employee?

        "Extracted Article": "Martech company Sprinklr recently laid off at least 50 staffers in its global marketing department. The firm says it is restructuring the unit under its new CMO as it focuses on more efficient growth. The cuts come amid a slew of recent layoffs in the tech sector. Sprinklr, the publicly traded customer experience software platform, laid off dozens of its employees late last month, Insider has learned. The cuts affected at least 50 roles in the company's global marketing department, sources with knowledge of the situation said. Impacted employees were notified late last month.A spokesperson for the company, which is headquartered in New York, confirmed the layoffs, but declined to comment on the exact number of staffers let go. More than 4,000 people on LinkedIn list that they currently work at Sprinklr, though this likely includes part-time roles. \"Sprinklr made the business decision to reorganize our marketing function under the leadership of our new CMO, which resulted in the elimination of some roles in marketing,\" said a Sprinklr spokesperson in a statement.Founded in 2009, Sprinklr offers clients including L'Oréal, UBS, and IKEA software that helps them manage their relationships with their customers and market to them on digital channels like social media sites, messaging apps, and their own websites and call centers. The company generates revenue by selling subscription software licenses.The new CMO, Arun Pattabhiraman, joined Sprinklr in May this year from India-based business-to-business software company Freshworks, where he was the firm's chief growth officer. News of Sprinklr's cuts mark the latest in a slew of tech layoffs this year, with many firms citing a slowdown in growth, increasing labor costs, rising interest rates, and fears about an impending recession. More than 22,000 US tech workers were laid off between the start of the year and the end of June, according to Crunchbase News.\"Our first priority is to support those affected with the greatest care and respect,\" the Sprinklr spokesperson's statement continued. \"We then must create a unified marketing function, hire the right roles in the right areas, and organize marketing to continue to help deliver profitable growth to the business.\"Sprinklr beat its own guidance by posting a 31% lift in revenue year-on-year in its most-recent quarter, but the company warned that this growth could slow. Sprinklr execs said the company faces \"tougher compares for the remainder of the year,\" which reflect its strong 2021 performance but also the challenges of the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Its operating loss widened to $23 million in the three months to April, up from $10.5 million in the year-ago quarter&nbsp; Sprinklr's stock is trading down by more than a third in the year to date.On the company's June earnings call, Sprinklr CEO Ragy Thomas said that while the company hadn't seen a slowdown in demand for its product, there had been a recent uptick in conversations with customers about \"uncertainty and pullback\" more generally.\"We are heavily focused on efficient and profitable growth, and restructuring marketing under our new CMO will enable us to right-size our program spend to generate sales pipeline and growth at scale,\" said the Sprinklr spokesperson in a statement.",

It was founded in 2019 to let stars like Paul McCartney and Addison Rae communicate with fans via text message. The company has raised $90 million in venture funding from Salesforce Ventures and others. Community, a platform that lets influencers and brands communicate with fans over text message, laid off about 40 staffers earlier this month, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. The platform, an&nbsp;SMS reimagining of a classic email-marketing tool, gives public figures and companies – including Eminem, Addison Rae, Paul McCartney, and Stacey Abrams – a unique phone number where fans can opt in to receive content and promotions.&nbsp;Influencers can also glean location and demographic information about their followers. Then, they can send messages to various subsets of their communities, or even on a one-to-one basis – to wish a fan happy birthday, for instance. Community monetizes by charging influencers and businesses a fee, which is based on frequency of use and the size of the following.&nbsp; Community launched in 2019, and in April 2021 raised $40 million from Salesforce Ventures, the software company's investment arm, The Wall Street Journal reported. That brought its total funding to $90 million, with other backers including Twilio, Live Nation Entertainment, and the Sony Innovation Fund.At the time, the company said it had 6,000 creators on its platform and 26 million users who had signed up to receive text messages.The company has said its main point of differentiation is enabling influencers and brands to connect with fans directly, without the deterrence of social media algorithms. It isn't the only company betting on text messaging. Other players in the field include Subtext; SimpleTexting (a division of MessageMedia); and Mailchimp, which last year acquired the text-marketing startup Chatitive.Community is not the first company at the intersection of tech and media to have layoffs amid a challenging economic climate. In addition to Netflix and Peloton, food content purveyor Food52 laid off 20 of its 200 employees in early April, while celebrity shoutout platform Cameo laid off 87 staffers in May. And creator economy startup Jellysmack laid off 8% of its staff earlier this month.",

        "Extracted Article": "Weee! laid off around 150 employees including its entire marketing team. Its CFO is also leaving the company. CEO Larry Liu told staff the cuts would extend its runway another year as it eyes an IPO. Weee!, the Asian and Hispanic grocery delivery service, recently cut 150 employees including several top executives, as the startup, recently valued at $4 billion, faces a tight funding market and broader ecommerce slowdown. The layoffs affected 10% of the company's workforce but were targeted mostly at its corporate ranks, including the marketing team which was almost entirely laid off, according to three people familiar with the matter. CEO Larry Liu also shook up his executive ranks, with his VPs of marketing and human resources out and his CFO, Ankur Shah, set to leave in the coming weeks, these people said.Weee!'s retrenchment is the latest in a wave of cutbacks within the grocery delivery world. In the last few months, rapid delivery startups like GoPuff, Gorillas, and Getir laid off hundreds of employees. Earlier this year, Instacart lowered its valuation to reflect the less exuberant economic environment. Weee! doesn't do rapid delivery and focuses on a subset of the market of people looking to buy Asian and Hispanic groceries, but the company still benefitted from the pandemic ecommerce boom. It has raised over $800 million since it launched in 2015 and earlier this year announced a $425 million Series E funding round led by Softbank which valued the company at $4.1 billion. Its other investors include Tiger Global, DST and Blackstone.Liu told Insider in a statement that the cuts were not a reaction to a business slowdown or the economic environment, but instead were part of its long-term strategy:\"With this reorganization, Weee!'s long-term outlook continues to be strong as we meet the needs of growing ethnic populations in the U.S. along with diversifying consumer tastes more broadly,\" he said. \"Following our recent highly successful Series E funding round, the company is well-positioned to thrive in a variety of market conditions as we continue to focus on long-term growth objectives.\" Liu declined to comment on the status of his CFO beyond saying Shah was currently serving in the role.&nbsp;Weee!'s growth had been good. Last year Weee! brought in around $400 million in revenue, double the previous year, as Insider reported. But since then its growth rate has slowed. Early last year, Weee! projected it could bring in $1 billion in revenue in 2022. But more recent forecasts put annual revenue closer to $600 to $700 million according to two people familiar with the matter.The layoffs also reflect Liu's desire to pull back on its high spending, high growth strategy and assert more control, people familiar with the matter said. Historically, Liu had run the business with a close eye on costs. He would approve purchases that were greater than $2,000. That changed as Weee! raised nine-figure rounds in 2021 and 2022 and the company built up its marketing team and hired a handful of senior executives.&nbsp;In announcing the layoffs internally, Liu made clear that it was back to basics when it came to operations and marketing. He also told his staff that cutting costs would help extend Weee!'s runway by a year— giving it three years of capital. Furthermore, he doesn't intend to raise more private financing; its next fundraising will instead come via an IPO, according to one person briefed on his statements.Liu told Insider that the cuts were designed to remove the need for any future private funding, but he had not ruled it out.

Jellysmack's leadership also told employees it planned to cease some international operations. Here's the email Jellysmack leadership team sent to employees on Thursday.&nbsp; Jellysmack laid off 8% of its employees on Thursday as part of a larger restructuring that affected several departments across the startup.&nbsp; The creator economy startup has raised over $991 million, according to Pitchbook, from backers including SoftBank, Unilever Ventures, and Highland Europe. The company, which identifies creator content that can be recut and distributed on platforms like Facebook and Snapchat to make ad revenue, had most recently set aside $500 million to buy the licensing rights to influencers' back catalogs in January, and doubled down on food creators, signing 23 of them in 2022 alone.\"In light of the current macroeconomic volatility, Jellysmack – like many other technology companies – anticipates a short-term decline in ad spending,\" a Jellysmack spokesperson told Insider in a statement. \"We have made the difficult decision to reduce the size of the Jellysmack team by 8% to focus on areas of growth that bring the most added value for our creator partners.\" A company-wide email sent on Thursday signaled Jellysmack's plans, which include shutting down commercial operations in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and curbing its investment in marketing.\"We will be reducing our investment in areas of the company that are not driving sustainable growth for us and for our creator partners,\" the cofounders wrote in the email.Impacted employees were then notified through a meeting with a senior leader or HR staffer.&nbsp; The company continues to employ over 1,000 employees post-layoffs.&nbsp;\"It came as quite a shock as there was no indication prior to today,\" said a person close to the company, who asked to not be identified to protect career prospects. Their identity is known to Insider. \"I'm very disappointed. I quite enjoyed my time at the company and was excited to be a part of a fast-growing organization in a very fluid field.\"&nbsp;Jellysmack's layoffs come as the tech sector braces for an economic downturn. Roughly 16,000 tech workers lost their jobs or saw job offers revoked in May alone at companies such as Carbon Health, Loom, Coinbase, and IRL. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also told company executives in early June to \"pause all hiring worldwide\" and reduce employee headcount by 10%.&nbsp; Here's the email Jellysmack's leadership team sent all employees:&nbsp;From: Michael Philippe&nbsp;Subject: Message from the founders Dear team,As you probably already know, we are seeing signs of an economic slowdown that is impacting technology companies globally. As a result, our platform partners anticipate decreases in ad spending.This will have implications for the entire Creator Economy, and Jellysmack is no exception. To ensure the mid and long-term success of the company and position ourselves for growth, it is essential we take action now.&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have come to the very hard decision to reduce the size of the Jellysmack team by 8%. This is a difficult and sad choice that no founder wants to make, but we know it's above all, difficult for the team members leaving Jellysmack.&nbsp;Focusing our business strategy Our long-term mission remains the same: to help creators Go Bigger. We will continue to pursue this ambition by focusing our efforts where we are seeing the most success and bringing the most value to creators.&nbsp;Therefore, we will be reducing our investment in areas of the company that are not driving sustainable growth for us and for our creator partners.This means: Narrowing our footprint in regions where we are seeing little tractionWe are shutting down our commercial operations in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. Some countries will be asked to narrow their focus to a more limited number of services such as India, South Korea, and Japan.Sunsetting parts of the business that don't bring the most immediate value to our creator partners We will be closing JellyX and reducing our Marketing investment globally.Increasing our focus on areas of the business that help us deliver on our missionWe will be right-sizing teams across the organization to support this more focused business strategy.&nbsp; What's next for impacted employeesWe are committed to supporting team members through this transition in a thoughtful and respectful way. All departing employees will be offered a severance package and provided job search assistance from our People team, should they wish to use it.&nbsp;For U.S. team members, we can provide immediate clarity. Within the next few hours, those leaving Jellysmack will receive a calendar invite for a meeting with a manager and an HR business partner. The details of individual severance packages will be outlined at this time and today will be the final working day for impacted employees.&nbsp; For team members outside of the U.S., this announcement and its implications will be conducted in accordance with local laws. Within the next few hours, impacted employees will receive a calendar invite for a meeting with a manager and an HR business partner. During this meeting, managers and HRBPs will be sharing the next steps.&nbsp;For those continuing on the Jellysmack journey&nbsp;Jellysmack's mission remains intact, and our strategy and ambition remain the same. We know we can rely on our strong foundations: our culture, our values, our DNA. These will guide us through our journey, so we can keep building the future of the Creator Economy. Over the next few days and weeks, we will share more details about supporting organizational changes that will help streamline our operations and make us a more focused and efficient company.&nbsp;In addition, a global all-hands meeting will be held at the end of the month to share more about our vision for the future, and to answer questions you may have about the actions we've taken to ensure Jellysmack's lasting success.&nbsp;To those leaving Jellysmack We want to thank you for all your hard work and your commitment to helping our company grow.

ID.me grew rapidly during the pandemic, hiring nearly 1,500 people and winning contracts with the IRS and state unemployment agencies. ID.me, an identity verification company that has done work for the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, and dozens of state unemployment agencies, said it would be laying off staff on Tuesday, Insider has learned.&nbsp; In an email to staff, CEO Blake Hall said the job cuts were because of a volatile economy and push for profitability.\"While ID.me has experienced tremendous growth, we are not immune from the difficult market conditions that have negatively affected the tech industry,\" Hall said in the email, which was obtained by Insider. \"To remain in control of our future, we must reorient the business around core products and establish an organic path to profitability.\" Hall said that affected employees would get an invitation to join a meeting within 30 minutes of his email, informing them of the layoff. Remaining employees were invited to join a town hall meeting that afternoon. A current employee who attended the town hall told Insider that Hall did not answer any questions from employees during the meeting.&nbsp;In a statement to Insider, the company's outside spokesperson, Patrick Dorton, declined to comment on how many employees were affected by the layoffs but claimed they only affected corporate employees, and not any of the customer support staff, known internally as Trusted Referees. According to seven current and former employees,&nbsp;the layoffs affected some&nbsp;customer service managers, senior members of the support team, and quality assurance auditors.\"With economic headwinds beginning to be felt across many industries, as good stewards of our company we must position ID.me for long-term success,\" Dorton said. \"ID.me is committed to investing its resources wisely to ensure its customers continue to be properly served.\" ID.me has grown rapidly since 2020, hiring nearly 1,500 employees and winning dozens of lucrative contracts with state unemployment agencies, the Social Security Administration, and the IRS in less than two years, Insider previously reported. In that time, it expanded its real-estate footprint and opened a new office in Tampa, Florida, in addition to its headquarters in McLean, Virginia.The company closed its most recent venture funding round, a $100 million Series C led by Viking Global Investors, in March 2021, valuing the company at $1.47 billion. It took on an additional $100 million in debt financing from Fortress Investment Group in September, according to PitchBook.ID.me's most profitable products, according to one person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss company financials, are its discount programs for veterans, nurses, doctors, and first responders. These workers qualify for a discount at major retailers and restaurants after verifying their identity and work status on ID.me. As reported in an Insider investigation, customer service workers hired during ID.me's rapid expansion described long helpline queues, user-data security lapses, and insufficient training to do their jobs or protect their mental health.People who had difficulty getting verified on ID.me could get locked out of their unemployment benefits or IRS child tax credit money. Hundreds of veterans lodged complaints to VA helplines that they had been barred access to healthcare, housing, and education benefits because of issues with ID.me, Insider previously reported.Employees who lost their jobs on Tuesday were told they would receive a severance package of up to four months of pay followed by two months of paid COBRA health coverage, according to two people. One of these people said that ID.me's leadership had asked employees earlier this year to tabulate the work their teams were doing, including estimates of time spent and the fiscal impact of individual employees' work. The company's chief financial officer, Stephen Benedict, and VP of engineering, Alexei Czeskis, assured employees that this assignment was not an indication of coming layoffs, this person said..&nbsp;\"It seems that last part was not true,\" they said.

Tech startups have faced a wave of layoffs as valuations drop and VC cash dries up. Sendoso, the SoftBank-backed marketing platform that lets companies send gifts to business connections, is the latest startup to succumb to layoffs amid a broader job cull in the tech industry. The startup on Monday laid off about 100 people from its 700-employee workforce, a Sendoso spokesperson confirmed to Insider. Layoffs affected employees in the US and Ireland across the company's business units, the spokesperson said.In a statement to Insider, Sendoso chief people officer Alexis Kavazanjian said that in the last month, market volatility and global crises have impacted the technology market. \"Because of this, Sendoso has come to the tough decision to adjust our operations, which requires a reduction in roles for some of our employees,\" Kavazanjian said, adding that the company will offer support for laid-off employees while \"ensuring that the company moves forward in a way that is best for our partners, customers, and future of the business.\"Sendoso announced in April that it was moving its headquarters from San Francisco to a new, $40 million office in Phoenix, Arizona.The startup&nbsp;is the latest in a long line of startups and tech firms that have laid off employees in recent weeks, affecting more than 20,000 workers so far in 2022. Superhuman, Main Street, Cameo, On Deck, and Robinhood recently cut staff, while countless other tech firms and startups are freezing or slowing hiring. The layoffs are coming as share prices for public tech companies have plummeted while VC funding has dried up, with investors instructing their startups to cut costs and extend their runways to avoid a \"death spiral.\"More than 21,000 tech workers have been laid off so far this year, with 16,800 people dismissed in May alone, according to the online layoffs-tracker Layoffs.fyi.Sendoso most recently completed a $100 million Series C funding round in September led by SoftBank Vision Fund. The Japanese investor, which has bet big on winners such as DoorDash and ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has sunk money into former startup darlings that have imploded, like WeWork, Better, and Greensill Capital.

The Tiger-backed startup has raised $126 million in funding and was last valued at $825 million. The wave of tech layoffs has reached even the pandemic darlings of the productivity sector. Email startup Superhuman has laid off 23 employees, representing about 22% of its workforce, CEO Rahul Vohra announced on Twitter on Friday. \"We are doing all we can to support them, including generous severance, mental health support, health insurance throughout the year, and job search assistance,\" Vohra added in a follow-up tweet. Vohra also offered to help those laid off to find a new job.Superhuman amassed a cult-like following among tech founders and investors for pledging to make email faster. The app uses keyboard shortcuts and pre-written messages to help users churn through their inbox in less time. Backed by Tiger Global, the startup has raised $126 million in funding, most recently at a $825 million valuation. It had its share of critics, to be sure. A Superhuman subscription costs $30 a month, which led some people to mock the app as luxury software for the tech elite. And until recently, people needed an invite from an existing user to join.For years, Superhuman elicited gripes from tech-savvy professionals that the app wasn't compatible with Microsoft Outlook, one of the world's largest email services with nearly 345 million paid users. People needed a Gmail email address to use the app. Superhuman finally arrived on Outlook in May, a major milestone for the five-year-old startup that had the potential to unleash hundreds of millions of paid subscribers.&nbsp;The integration came about a year after Superhuman fired up enterprise sales, where businesses pay for licenses directly or through reimbursement.The layoffs raise questions about the success of the launch, which had the potential to turbocharge business. The layoffs are part of cutbacks sweeping the tech industry as venture capitalists slow down their pace of investing and startups slash their burn.

The wave of tech layoffs has reached the supply-chain sector. Flexible-warehousing startup Stord laid off 59 employees — about 8% of its 700-strong workforce — Thursday, the company confirmed to Insider. The layoffs came from multiple business units within the company, a spokesperson said via email.&nbsp; Founded in 2015, Stord is a cloud-based platform that connects hundreds of independent warehouses to a network so shippers can keep inventory close to consumers without leasing space. It began offering trucking and e-commerce-fulfillment services during the pandemic.&nbsp;\"While this was a challenging day for everyone, the company remains in an incredibly strong position as brands continue to invest in the technology and logistics solutions they need to meet customer expectations and fuel growth,\" a spokesperson told Insider via email. \"Stord has achieved record revenue growth, is on pace for greater growth in Q2, and has an extremely strong balance sheet with the additional capital raised in May.\"&nbsp; Stord announced an additional $120 million in Series D funding less than a month ago, which brought its Series D total to $210 million. Franklin Templeton Investments led the round and was top of mind for some of the laid-off employees.&nbsp;\"Our CEO specifically came out and said this is our war chest — this is going to hold us through any tough times,\" a laid-off Stord employee, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their future job prospects, told Insider Thursday.Stord notified affected employees Wednesday night of a meeting the next morning and some started to expect layoffs when the calendar invite for the meeting said it was only scheduled for 15 minutes.&nbsp; During the meeting — conducted on Zoom with no visible participants — Stord cofounders Sean Henry and Jacob Boudreau said they'd hired too quickly, according to two affected workers. Ahead of the new funding announcement on May 10, the founders told multiple media outlets they would reach 1,000 employees by the end of the year.&nbsp;\"We all got off the phone very confused because they had just raised all that money a few weeks ago and had a $1.3 billion valuation,\" said another laid-off employee speaking on the condition of anonymity.&nbsp;Stord's spokesperson said the company \"has a stronger balance sheet and more capital than ever,\" and that \"running a responsible business requires regular reviews of our entire business to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible. Stord is in a position of strength and set up for long term success.\" Stord will continue to pay laid-off employees until June 15, when the firm will give them severance packages with amounts based on the time they worked with the company, Stord confirmed. The company will also provide \"career assistance, résumé writing, and networking on an ongoing basis,\" according to the spokesperson.During the pandemic, customers and funders took a new interest in supply-chain tech, specifically warehousing startups like Stord. The company entered the pandemic with less than $20 million in funding and reached 2022 with a fundraising total above $300 million.&nbsp;Santosh Sankar, an early Stord investor and managing partner at Dynamo Ventures — which led the company's seed round — told Insider the business still has \"impressive fundamentals.\"&nbsp; \"Parting ways with colleagues is hard,\" Sankar told Insider via email. \"But Stord is in a strong position and continues to make the right investments for sustainable success.\"&nbsp;Have you been laid off by a supply-chain tech startup?

Geolocation tech firm TomTom is laying off 500 employees in its maps unit after engineering investments improved its automated mapmaking platform, the company said. It announced the decision in a company press release published on Wednesday.&nbsp;The number of maps unit employees affected is equivalent to around 10% of the company's total global headcount.&nbsp; \"Higher levels of automation and the integration of a variety of digital sources will result in fresher and richer maps, with wider coverage,\" said TomTom CEO Harold Goddijn in the statement.&nbsp;A TomTom spokesperson told Insider: \"The intended reorganization is spread over more than 20 countries globally.

Tech companies have been battered by stock sell-offs as yearly revenue projections have been downgraded and investors have gotten jitters.Once best-known for its satellite car navigation, Amsterdam-based TomTom revamped its strategy in 2019, including to cater to self-driving car mapping technology. It has signed a string of partnerships with major car brands to provide HD maps to their systems, amounting to a roughly 60% market share in HD maps when measured by total car volume, according to a corporate pitch deck. It also has ongoing partnerships with Uber, Microsoft, and Apple Maps, according to Venture Beat.&nbsp;TomTom joins a rapidly growing list of tech companies slashing their workforces, including European tech darling Klarna, a \"buy now, pay later\" fintech that laid off around 700 of its employees this month.

In a statement to Insider, Eaze said the cuts were related to a merger that closed in January. Cannabis tech startup Eaze quietly laid off as many as 25 employees, Insider has learned. The layoffs took place on Wednesday, and the cuts included members of Eaze's engineering team and live operations team, which handles its delivery service. Three former employees described the job cuts to Insider. They asked not to be identified to preserve relationships and protect future job opportunities in the industry.\"While it is always a difficult decision to part with dedicated employees, we must make changes in order to be successful in the maturing cannabis market,\" Eaze CEO Ro Choy said in a statement to Insider on Friday. \"These changes position Eaze for long-term growth as we continue to focus on providing a high quality delivery and shopping experience for Eaze customers and partners in California, Colorado, Michigan and Florida.\" Eaze began as a cannabis delivery service in the Bay Area and has weathered a few tumultuous years of executive churn, layoffs, and business pivots.The latest layoffs come after quietly cutting jobs in October and again in February, Insider has learned. The February layoffs affected roughly 20 employees, including Eaze's government affairs and communications team, its legal team, and other divisions, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company laid off 36 employees in 2019.Eaze has also seen a parade of long-tenured senior executives depart in the past few months, the people said.&nbsp; In August of last year, the startup — once a darling of the young cannabis industry — acquired Green Dragon, a chain of cannabis dispensaries with storefronts in Colorado and Florida, in an all-stock deal. The acquisition was an effort to pivot into selling cannabis itself rather than just delivering it, as Insider has reported.&nbsp;In its statement to Insider, Eaze said that the cuts were related to the Green Dragon acquisition, which closed in January.\"As a result of the merger with Green Dragon, Eaze has eliminated a number of positions from various departments to increase efficiencies within the merged company operations,\" the statement read. In 2020, Eaze shifted to running its own dispensaries, rather than partnering with other companies, Insider&nbsp;previously reported. The company was forced to pare back expectations that it would sell over $1 billion worth of cannabis that year as well.Eaze's struggles aren't unusual in the broader tech industry. During the earlier part of the pandemic, the US technology industry boomed. Firms like Amazon and Apple reached record-breaking market caps, while private companies received large funding injections from venture capital firms loaded with cash. But now, an ugly downturn has hit the industry with layoffs brewing.Eaze CEO Rogelio Choy told Insider in August that the company was looking to raise a $75 million Series E funding round at a $700 million pre-money valuation, with 80% of the capital already committed as of last August. In its statement to Insider, Eaze said that it closed its Series E round in January with $65 million in funding.&nbsp; Read Eaze's full statement below:As part of a strategic shift integrating retail with delivery, Eaze Technologies, a leading cannabis delivery company based in California, finalized the acquisition of Colorado-based Green Dragon early this year. With 16 dispensary locations in Colorado and an MMTC license in Florida, Eaze Technologies will focus on the build out of its Florida footprint including over 25 stores in 2022, and a 400,000 square foot cultivation and manufacturing facility.As a result of the merger with Green Dragon, Eaze has eliminated a number of positions from various departments to increase efficiencies within the merged company operations. \"While it is always a difficult decision to part with dedicated employees, we must make changes in order to be successful in the maturing cannabis market\", said Ro Choy, CEO of Eaze. \"These changes position Eaze for long-term growth as we continue to focus on providing a high quality delivery and shopping experience for Eaze customers and partners in California, Colorado, Michigan and Florida.\"By the end of 2022, the company plans to continue to expand its retail footprint after acquiring two retail locations in Southern California, which operate under the name Eaze Dispensary. In January of 2022, the company completed its acquisition of Green Dragon and closed on $65 million in its Series E fundraise.Are you an Eaze employee with insight to share? Got a tip?

        "Extracted Article": "The purchase-mortgage firm Tomo is cutting almost a third of its staff and halting expansion plans. The news comes amid a wave of layoffs in the mortgage industry as interest rates have soared. Venture-capital markets have also cooled, with some VCs advising startups to lower costs. Tomo, a startup focused on providing mortgages to people buying homes, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 44 people, or almost a third of its roughly 150 employees. The news comes amid a wave of layoffs at traditional lenders like Wells Fargo and more tech-enabled venture-backed startups like Better as interest rates have risen and volumes have slowed. Last week the drumbeat of job cuts continued at the lending arm of the brokerage Keller Williams, a company that also counts mostly on its purchase-mortgage business.Tomo burst onto the scene last year with a pitch that it would work only with the more stable but more work-intensive purchase-mortgage market instead of the cyclical refinance market, following a $70 million seed infusion that was likely the largest-ever fundraise for a proptech. The company announced a $40 million Series A this year, with investors buying into the view that home purchases would remain strong, CEO Greg Schwartz, a former chief revenue and chief business officer at Zillow, told Insider. Market conditions have since deteriorated — largely because of a 2-percentage-point increase in the average 30-year mortgage rate this year — making it clear that even companies tying their success to a firm housing market will face challenges.Tomo on Tuesday said it was making significant staff cuts and rethinking plans to expand into additional real-estate markets.\"The recent shift in the mortgage and venture capital markets due to the rapid increase in interest rates has impacted Tomo's business plans, and led us to make changes to our near-term strategy,\" Schwartz wrote in a statement provided to Insider. \"As part of these measures, we have reduced the size of Tomo's workforce by almost a third. This was a last resort, but ultimately something we felt was necessary to maintain a strong foundation.\" The Mortgage Bankers Association predicted this month that purchase-mortgage originations would increase in 2022 from last year. But those projections have been pared back from the start of this year, suggesting that the shift has surprised even the most seasoned mortgage professionals. Refinancing originations are projected to plunge to well less than half of their 2021 volume.Meanwhile, one of the most voracious buyers of homes has cooled its activity. Redfin's iBuying unit has turned cautious on the US residential market because of growing \"macro uncertainty,\" its chief financial officer, Chris Nielsen, said during the Jefferies Virtual Internet Summit on Tuesday, according to Seeking Alpha.While there is room for purchase mortgages to grow, the softening housing market is being met by a historic pullback in the venture-capital market after a jubilant boom during the pandemic. There are increasing signs that the venture-capital industry is slowing down, leading some investors advising startups to cut back on their commitments.",

The company grew quickly after raising a significant Series A, but revenue failed to keep pace. In January 2022, B2B financial-services startup MainStreet flew the entire company out for a week-long working vacation in Maui.&nbsp; About 150 employees stayed at the luxurious Grand Wailea Hotel, attended meetings, and enjoyed free buffets at the beachfront Hawaiian resort. Workers who questioned the expense were told the startup was aiming to land a significant Series B funding round that would ensure significant runway.But the funding that ultimately materialized was smaller than originally planned, Insider has learned, and on Tuesday the company cut around 50 employees — roughly a third of its workforce. The layoffs highlight the risks of unchecked startup spending as financial markets become increasingly turbulent, and come hot on the heels of similar rounds of employee reductions at Robinhood and Cameo.In an email to staff, MainStreet CEO Doug Ludlow cited difficult market conditions and a push toward profitability. \"We took this action because we believe that there is a very strong chance that today's incredibly rough market is only going to get worse, and potentially remain so for months, if not years,\" he wrote.\"We need to ensure that as a company we are in control of our own destiny, not subject to the whims and waves of the market. This reorg is one of the steps that puts us on a near-term path to profitability and self-sustainability.\" MainStreet was founded in 2019, and grew rapidly on the back of a product that helped startups and other businesses claim tax credits. In March 2021, it raised $60 million in a Series A funding round from investors including SignalFire, Tusk Venture Partners, and Sound Ventures.&nbsp;Headcount and costs quickly ballooned, one source said, but revenue growth failed to keep pace. The company set its sights on securing a similarly lofty Series B — an effort known internally as \"Baker Street\" — but Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rising uncertainty in the markets proved troublesome.&nbsp;The company's chief marketing officer Stacey Politi shared a copy of Ludlow's email to staff with Insider, and did not respond to further questions about the business. The VP of engineering, VP of people, VP of sales, and VP of design have all left the company, one source said, with some taking voluntary severance. Rank-and-file layoffs came from across much of the company, including engineering, sales, and marketing.&nbsp;Let-go employees were given two months' salary, healthcare support, and were allowed to keep their laptops.Here's the full email CEO Doug Ludlow sent employees:This week, we took the difficult step of reorganizing and restructuring the company, and in doing so have eliminated ~30% of the roles at @MainStreet. &nbsp;I know from firsthand experience just how painful it is to lose a job due to a reorg - it can be confusing, disorienting, and scary - so I understand just how difficult this week is for our affected team members.We did not take this decision lightly, and we are doing everything within our power to provide as much transition assistance (severance, health care, recruiter and job placement assistance) as is possible.A big part of leadership is looking reality square in the eye, and then making the right call, no matter how difficult it may seem.&nbsp; We took this action because we believe that there is a very strong chance that today's incredibly rough market is only going to get worse, and potentially remain so for months, if not years.&nbsp;We need to ensure that as a company we are in control of our own destiny, not subject to the whims and waves of the market. This reorg is one of the steps that puts us on a near-term path to profitability and self-sustainability.&nbsp;We believe deeply in our mission of helping support founders and small business owners, and we are committed to doing whatever needs to be done to achieve that mission. How can you help? Please DM me, and let me know if you're hiring. I will connect you with our internal recruiting team who is working to help place former MainStreet Team Members with new roles.Thanks,&nbsp;Doug",

        "Extracted Article": "Food52, a crowdsourced recipe and home goods bizarre, was founded in 2009. It laid off around 20 staffers Wednesday in an apparent shift towards e-commerce. Employees Insider spoke with said they were shocked because they had just been given raises. On Wednesday morning, about 20 of the roughly 200 employees at Food52, the popular venture-backed recipe and home-goods bazaar, received an unusual calendar invitation to have an individual \"check-in\" over Google Meet with a company executive. Those employees, who were part of Food52's content team, were told by SVP of content Stacey Rivera that they were being laid off, effective immediately. Within minutes, their Slack and email accounts were suddenly shut off, according to two employees who requested anonymity to speak about the layoffs.&nbsp;\"Everyone on the team and my immediate boss were gut-punched,\" one of these employees told Insider. \"We all had gotten raises and bonuses just a month prior.\" \"We just had new funding, we just acquired another company, and leadership only said everything was going very well,\" another employee added, referring to the $80 million investment the company secured from TCG in December and its recent $48 million acquisition of decor and furnishings company Schoolhouse.TCG, which is the investment arm of The Chernin Group, previously bought&nbsp;an $83 million majority stake in the company in 2019. The latest funding round valued the company at $300 million, according to Pitchbook. Food52 has more than 200 employees, according to LinkedIn.For the previous decade, Food52 had operated independently as a website offering easy-to-make recipes for everything from egg sandwiches to acorn squash soup, along with selling home goods like ice cube trays and bakeware. Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, two veteran food journalists who worked for The New York Times, cofounded Food52 in 2009. &nbsp; Rivera, as well as Kelsey Burrow, a spokeswoman for Food52, declined to comment but referred to the company's in a Digiday story confirming 20 staffers had been laid off where she said the reductions are a move to \"better support our commerce business and to better integrate the two companies we acquired last year.\"&nbsp;Mike Kerns, a partner at TCG who led the Food52 investment, did not respond to a request for comment.The layoffs signal a shift towards Food52's more lucrative home goods marketplace and away from costlier original content like recipes and cooking tips. At least two of the terminated employees were told by executives the company was \"pivoting to commerce.\" One was told \"content is getting too expensive.\"&nbsp; \"I guess that they're limiting resources for quality content and instead focusing on selling stuff,\" one employee said, adding that the editing and social media teams were particularly hard hit.—Margaret Eby (@margareteby) April 7, 2022 &nbsp;In 2020, Food52 doubled its revenue from the previous year and achieved profitability for the first time, according to Fast Company, which reported the company is now planning to open pop-up shops and brick-and-mortar stores.\"Food52 capitalized on the understanding that if you create a body of communal knowledge that you share, readers are more likely to buy other products from you,\" food historian KC Hysmith told the magazine. The company has already increased its e-commerce focus. In addition to its $48 million deal for Schoolhouse in December, Food52 acquired the cookware brand Dansk last year for an undisclosed amount.Got a tip?

The company&nbsp;has also paused several plans to open more warehouses in the US, two of the people said. Gopuff may be controlling costs ahead of a possible IPO later this year. Gopuff has cut about 100 jobs across the company's operations and warehouse teams, three people familiar with the matter said. The company has also paused several plans to open more warehouses across the US, two of the people said. The moves may help the ultrafast-delivery startup control costs and prepare for a possible IPO later this year.Gopuff mostly eliminated the district-manager position across the company. Many of these managers were let go with little notice, told by their superiors to leave work that day, and await details about severance, the people said. Other managers were offered different roles within the company, they added, while asking to not be identified while discussing sensitive topics.&nbsp; District managers at Gopuff oversee multiple warehouses and serve as a layer between the managers who run individual warehouses and regional managers who oversee larger swaths of territory, such as the South or parts of New England.&nbsp;Other parts of the company's warehouse operations also cut jobs, including teams that trained managers and warehouse workers, teams that set up new warehouse operations, and human-resources groups.&nbsp;Gopuff says it currently employs about 10,000 people and is continuing to hire. The company added that it continually reevalutes its warehouse locations to maximize for demand. Gopuff added more warehouse square footage in 2021 than the previous 36 months combined, according to the company. The moves reorient the company's warehouse operations away from a management-heavy retail model toward one that's perhaps closer to a tech-driven Amazon approach. Gopuff has hired heavily from Amazon in the past year. Tim Collins, its VP of operations, spent more than 15 years at the tech giant. The company's founders have long admired Amazon and internally discussed their ambitions to build a company at that scale.Gopuff had been aggressively expanding over the past few years, opening hundreds of distribution and delivery warehouses across the country. It also acquired traditional retailers, such as BevMo and Liquor Barn.Warehouses managers previously described the operations as chaotic, with an oversupply of goods piling up outside facilities and not enough staff. It's unclear whether the recent changes will improve the situation at the warehouses or make them worse. Warehouse managers frequently complained that they weren't getting enough support from Gopuff's facilities teams or upper management.&nbsp; Still, cutting costs may be higher on the agenda for the company, which was valued at $15 billion last year. One of the questions lingering over Gopuff's possible IPO this year is how receptive the markets will be to a money-losing company. Last year, Gopuff lost around $500 million, before interest, taxes, and other costs, Axios reported.Are you an insider with insight to share? Got a tip?

Israeli startup Electriq Global has accumulated liabilities of approximately NIS 105 million ($29.4M), including debts to shareholders. On Thursday, the Haifa District Court, at the company's request and that of its employees, issued an order to freeze proceedings. The court also appointed Attorney Alona Baumgarten as the company's trustee to oversee its rehabilitation. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2025 Founded in 2013, Electriq Global operates in the hydrogen sector and is developing a circular platform for the storage and release of hydrogen gas. This effort aligns with global initiatives to develop technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate the transition to green energy. According to the company's application, its first planned product line is backup generators powered by solid hydrogen. While Electriq Global previously employed about 30 workers, its workforce has now been reduced to six. The company also operated a development center in Tirat Carmel and laboratories spanning approximately 1,200 square meters. Since its founding, Electriq Global has raised approximately $25 million in funding. In its court filing, the company cited financial difficulties stemming from stalled negotiations with a Dutch investor, who froze an investment of €25 million due to the security situation in Israel and the ongoing war. The request for court protection and rehabilitation was supported by an affidavit from director Baruch Halpert. The request for an order to initiate rehabilitation proceedings was submitted after 13 current and former employees, represented by Attorney Ofir Ronen, petitioned for a trustee to be appointed with the company's consent. They claimed that Electriq Global failed to pay salaries for January 2025 and could not fully cover February wages for both current and laid-off employees. Electriq Global said in a statement: “Following the employees' request to appoint a trustee and initiate proceedings, the company is working to formulate the best possible arrangement for both employees and suppliers. There is significant interest in the company’s technology, and we hope shareholders will support its continued operation to maximize its potential. The company will work to establish a debt settlement plan and will submit an application to the court in the coming days.”",

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity startup NanoLock collapses, seeks court-appointed trustee . The Israeli firm, once backed by $27 million in funding, cites war-related financial strain and cash flow crisis as it halts operations. The Israeli cybersecurity company NanoLock Security filed a request on Wednesday with the Central District Court for the appointment of a temporary trustee due to its insolvency. The request aims to preserve the company’s assets and retain some of its employees while urgently seeking to maximize the realization of its assets through a sale of its operations. According to the filing, the company has debts of approximately 7 million shekels ($1.97 million) and an additional $2.5 million in debt to shareholders. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2025 NanoLock is a startup specializing in the protection and management of industrial controllers used across various industries, including food, energy, ports, hospitals, and manufacturing. The company employs 26 people, but in recent days, it has notified employees of the cessation of operations and the termination of their employment. NanoLock was founded in 2017 by CEO Eran Fine. The filing states that many controllers produced by various suppliers lack basic cybersecurity protections. NanoLock’s technology is designed not only to protect these controllers from unauthorized changes but also to provide management, monitoring, and enforcement capabilities for operational and policy changes. The company is owned by a parent company registered in Delaware, USA. According to the request, NanoLock’s customers in Israel include Israel Chemicals and Tosaf. The company was also in advanced discussions, though without finalized installations, with Sheba Tel Hashomer Hospital and Ashdod Port. Additionally, NanoLock had ongoing engagements at various stages with other companies in Israel. Since its founding, the American parent company has raised approximately $27 million in multiple investment rounds and received $2.5 million in shareholder loans. Of these funds, approximately $28 million was invested in NanoLock. The company also secured a $2 million loan from Discount Bank, of which about $1 million has been repaid. Additionally, it received grants totaling approximately $3 million from the Israel Innovation Authority. The filing claims that despite investors pouring tens of millions of shekels into the company, changing market conditions—including the war and its impact on customers—along with difficulties in developing specific product features and the long sales cycles required to engage customers, have led to severe cash flow problems. As a result, the company now faces financial distress. The request further asserts that, given the company’s lack of funds to continue operations and product development, along with its outstanding debts, it has no choice but to cease operations. The company argues that appointing a trustee is the only viable option to maximize its remaining value, potentially through the sale of its operations, intellectual property, or technology, which requires significant effort and investment to develop. Attorneys Yonat Meir and Shai Piade, representing the company, stated: \\\"Over the past year, and in the shadow of the war, NanoLock Security has faced significant financial and operational challenges that have affected its business. Given these circumstances and the difficulties involved, the company has turned to the court to initiate appropriate proceedings. NanoLock thanks all its employees, customers, and partners for their support and trust over the years.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Outbrain and Teads complete merger, cutting 200 jobs globally. The $625 million deal aims to save up to $75 million annually by 2026 through role reductions.  With the completion of the merger between Israeli digital advertising company Outbrain and French company Teads, the merged entity will part ways with about 200 employees, most of them outside Israel. This move is part of what is known in the business world as the realization of synergies, meaning the elimination of duplicate roles. The companies expect annual cost savings following the merger to reach $65 to $75 million by 2026. The deal consists of a cash payment of $625 million, $25 million in future payments, 35 million Outbrain shares valued at approximately $169 million at the time of signing, and $105 million in convertible shares above a price of $10. This is a unique transaction structure for the high-tech industry, more reminiscent of a leveraged buyout, which will also give a significant stake in the merged company to the owners of Teads. Following the deal, the European telecom corporation Altice, the current owner of Teads, will appoint two directors to the company, who will join the eight current directors of Outbrain. To finance the deal, Outbrain secured significant credit from Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and other banks. The merged company will have 2,000 employees, 20,000 advertisers on its platform, and is expected to reach 2 billion consumers per month. Although Outbrain is technically the acquiring party, the merged company will be called Teads, maintaining the stronger and more recognizable brand. David Kostman, CEO of Outbrain, will serve as CEO of the new company while also holding the position of chairman at Israeli software company NICE. Outbrain reported that in the fourth quarter, its last before the merger, it generated revenues of $68.3 million, with projected revenues of $236.1 million for 2024. Teads ended the quarter with revenues of $119.9 million and closed the year with $386.6 million. The French company's adjusted EBITDA is also higher—$122.7 million projected for 2024 compared to $37.3 million for Outbrain. Together, the two companies generate revenues of $623 million and an adjusted operating profit of $230 million. Outbrain is moving closer to the traditional advertising market with this merger, acquiring a company considered a pioneer in video-based advertising. Outbrain had previously courted Teads, but the talks did not materialize into a deal. Teads was sold in 2017 to Patrick Drahi's Altice Media Corporation for $307 million, but Drahi recently sought to divest non-core assets, creating an opportunity for Outbrain. Drahi exited the deal with a significant profit, securing $625 million in cash, a 40% stake, two board seats in the merged company, and additional future payments contingent on meeting certain performance goals. About a year ago, Yaron Galai, founder and co-CEO of Outbrain, stepped down, leaving Kostman as the sole CEO. Galai resigned after Outbrain struggled to achieve significant growth following its 2021 IPO on the Nasdaq, where it was valued at $1.2 billion, subsequently losing nearly 80% of its market value.",

Unicorn AppsFlyer is laying off 100 of its employees, about 7% of its workforce. The company currently employs 1,200 people, two-thirds of whom are based in Israel. The layoffs will affect employees both in Israel and in the company’s other global offices. AppsFlyer was founded in 2011 by Oren Kaniel and Reshef Mann. According to estimates, the company's revenue is currently around $400 million, and the layoffs may be part of preparations for a planned IPO in the coming year. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2025 AppsFlyer was founded in 2011 by Oren Kaniel and Reshef Mann. The company has developed technology that allows app owners to identify where their most profitable users originated from, such as a Google search, an ad on Facebook or X, direct email, an SMS message, a television campaign, and more. The company has made several acquisitions in recent years that expanded its product portfolio. In the last significant fundraising carried out by the company in 2020, it was valued at $2 billion. Among the investors in the Israeli company are General Atlantic, the Salesforce investment fund, the Goldman Sachs growth fund, Qumra Capital, DTCP, Pitango Growth, and Magma. In a letter to employees, Oren Kaniel, the company’s CEO and co-founder, wrote: “I am writing to inform you of a difficult decision we have made to ensure we remain agile, innovative, and positioned for long-term success. As part of this step, we will be parting ways with approximately 100 team members – representing 7% of our workforce – colleagues and friends who have been integral to our success and the impact we’ve made together. “As a people-centric organization, we carefully considered every aspect before making this decision, ensuring that it was made with deep thought and concern for everyone affected.” Kaniel outlined in the letter a strategic shift aimed at driving long-term growth and maintaining competitiveness in a rapidly evolving industry. He emphasized the importance of becoming leaner to improve agility, make faster decisions, and focus resources on the most impactful projects. Kaniel underscored the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), announcing significant investments in AI tools, models, and team training. “Even as we achieve record financial performance – profitable in 2024 for the first time, cash flow positive for over two years, and exceeding revenue, ARR, and EBITDA goals – we believe now is the right time to take this step,” Kaniel added. “While it may seem unexpected to make such changes during a period of success, it is precisely this strength, combined with our strategic leadership, that enables us to act decisively, invest in growth, and ensure AppsFlyer remains at the forefront of innovation. “The most successful companies make bold, forward-thinking decisions from a position of strength—not in reaction to challenges. By taking this step now, we are realigning resources to drive the greatest long-term impact, ensuring AppsFlyer remains agile, competitive, and positioned for sustained leadership in an ever-evolving industry.”",

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon-backed robotics startup BionicHIVE shuts down with $18M debt. The Sderot-based company blames war and lost investor confidence for its financial collapse.  The Israeli robotics manufacturer BionicHIVE has accumulated debts of approximately NIS 66 million (approximately $18 million) and has filed a request with the Be'er Sheva District Court for liquidation, alongside a stay of proceedings and the appointment of a temporary trustee. The company gained international recognition in January 2021 after billionaire Elon Musk praised its technology on Twitter, writing that \\\"The robot future is coming\\\". Judge Yaakov Persky approved the company's request and issued an order halting all proceedings. This means that no legal actions can be initiated against the company, nor can its debts be collected. The judge also ruled that a temporary trustee would be appointed, with their identity to be determined in a hearing scheduled for Monday. According to BionicHIVE, its financial collapse was directly caused by the effects of the “Swords of Iron” war on the Israeli economy, particularly on the high-tech sector, which relies heavily on investment capital. The company stated that, despite significant efforts, it struggled to recover due to its primary funding pipeline—investment from foreign investors—being cut off. This was attributed to investors' reluctance to invest in Israeli companies during the conflict. Additionally, the company cited other war-related circumstances that resulted in a severe cash flow shortage, preventing it from continuing operations or meeting financial obligations. BionicHIVE, a privately held company based in the city of Sderot, was founded in 2014 by Liran Raizer, Itamar Levy, Tomer Amit, and Olivier Haddad. At its peak, the company employed 30 workers. Among its significant investors is the global e-commerce giant Amazon. “Amazon has recognized BionicHIVE for its differentiated solution capable of optimizing safety around repeated tasks, at any height, in the supply chain workplace, and this is the kind of technology that’s pulling innovation forward,” said Katherine Chen, Head of the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, at the time. Since its establishment, the company has focused on developing robotic systems for warehouses and logistics operations. Its flagship product, SqUID, is an advanced robotic system designed to automate the collection, organization, and distribution of goods in logistics warehouses. According to the company, the system is unique in its ability to convert a manual warehouse into an automated one with minimal investment while maintaining seamless collaboration between human personnel and robots. The robots operate autonomously on the warehouse floor and, when required to reach elevated locations, attach to rails installed on the shelves. This allows them to replace human workers in picking, organizing, and storing tasks at any height or location. The company, represented by attorneys Mazal Maru and Guy Azulay from the Agmon & Tulchinsky law firm, stated that it has raised approximately $15 million from investors since its founding, along with an additional $3 million from the Israel Innovation Authority. As of now, the company has developed around 30 robots, which it claims have significant business potential. BionicHIVE also revealed that, prior to the outbreak of the war, it was in advanced negotiations to secure additional investments and finalize agreements with existing customers for the commercial distribution of its next-generation robot systems. However, operations were abruptly halted when the company's offices in Sderot were closed due to the area being declared a military zone. Many employees, including two of the founders, were evacuated from their homes, and some were called up for military service. As part of its court filing, the company disclosed liabilities totaling approximately NIS 66.6 million, with the majority (around NIS 65 million) owed to various investors and NIS 700,000 owed to employees.",

Mobileye is shutting down its lidar sensor development division, which employs 100 people. While Mobileye, which is focused on developing autonomous vehicles, will try to find internal positions for some employees, it is estimated that most will be laid off. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 This move represents significant cost savings for Mobileye, as the division's development expenses were projected to reach $60 million, with no expected revenue. Lidar is an advanced sensor, one of the key components of autonomous vehicles, but Mobileye has yet to complete internal development and currently uses sensors from the Israeli company Innoviz. Innoviz is currently valued at only $88 million, so acquiring it could be more cost-effective for Mobileye than continuing to fund internal lidar development, which has already consumed over $100 million. The lidar industry was once considered one of the most promising fields in the sector, but recently the prices of these sensors have dropped significantly. Meanwhile, advancements in AI raise questions about their necessity. About five years ago, Elon Musk famously declared that lidar is not essential for autonomous vehicles and serves mainly as a redundancy measure. Lidar is a type of advanced radar that can operate effectively in low-visibility conditions, such as darkness or stormy weather. Mobileye issued a statement: \\\"As part of our regular review of the long-term technology roadmap, we now believe that the availability of next-generation FMCW lidar is less essential to our roadmap for eyes-off systems. This decision was based on a variety of factors, including substantial progress on our EyeQ6-based computer vision perception, increased clarity on the performance of our internally developed imaging radar, and continued better-than-expected cost reductions in third-party time-of-flight lidar units.” Mobileye will continue its internal development of imaging radar, which is expected to reach production next year and is considered a strategic priority. This is another major shift in Mobileye’s operations this year, part of the company’s broader efforts to reduce expenses. Earlier this year, the company shut down its original driver-assistance systems, which warned drivers about lane departures or imminent collisions. As part of that restructuring, 130 employees were let go, 90 of whom were based in Israel. Following the current round of cuts, Mobileye’s workforce will shrink to around 3,500 employees, though many open positions remain listed on the company’s website. Mobileye has been facing a slowdown since late 2023, and its market value recently dropped below $10 billion for the first time. This decline is compounded by speculation that Intel, which still owns 88% of Mobileye's shares, may sell them to address its own liquidity challenges. Amid falling revenues, which have led to several downward revisions of its annual sales forecast (currently expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, $1 billion less than originally projected), Mobileye has posted a significant operating loss, nearing $100 million in the last quarter. Mobileye's shares have plunged by 73% since the beginning of the year, bringing the company’s value to $9.3 billion.",

Once one of the most promising medical startups in Israel, DayTwo raised $85 million in total, but failed to navigate market challenges.  DayTwo, once one of the most promising medical startups in Israel, is closing its doors for good. The company's management informed the remaining few dozen employees on Monday that it will be shutting down, Calcalist has learned. DayTwo declined to comment on the news. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 As sad as the closure is, it is not entirely surprising. About a year ago, DayTwo laid off most of its employees, leaving only a small core team focused on supporting existing customers and exploring new development directions. At its peak, DayTwo employed hundreds of workers. DayTwo was founded based on the research and development of two professors from the Weizmann Institute, Eran Segal and Eran Elinav, and was established with the assistance and funding of Marius Nacht, the founder of Check Point, who in recent years has focused primarily on investments in medical startups. The company was founded in 2015 and raised a substantial $85 million over its lifetime from investors including the aMoon fund, the Israeli 10D fund specializing in early-stage companies, the Samsung Next fund, Cathay Innovation Ventures, Poalim Capital Markets, La’maison Fund, and Micron Ventures. In 2018, DAYTWO also received a small investment from basketball player Omri Casspi, who used the company’s kit and even served as its spokesperson in the Israeli market. DayTwo’s goal was to develop and market kits that tailored proper nutrition for diabetics based on their stool samples. The unique aspect of the company’s nutrition recommendations was that they didn’t necessarily advocate traditional diet foods instead, they sometimes recommended that it was healthier for individuals to eat foods like pizza, hamburgers with fries, or bread with butter. The analysis of the stool samples allowed for personalized recommendations, based on genetics and blood sugar tests, with tracking available through an app. While DayTwo showed promising results in improving blood sugar levels, the results in terms of weight loss were inconclusive. Additionally, there was criticism that some of the foods highly rated by DayTwo’s system were not healthy, even if they helped lower blood sugar levels. Despite initial enthusiasm and distribution through Maccabi and Clalit health services, which offered the kits for a one-time fee, DayTwo’s business model ultimately failed to be profitable. Four years ago, the company’s CEO and co-founder, Lihi Segal, left the company. More recently, the company was managed by Gal Gonen, who also served as CFO. The plan was to enter the American market with a subscription model aimed at organizations and insurance companies, some of which had signed agreements with the Israeli company. However, it seems that the popularity of Ozempic-type diabetes injections, which help both maintain appropriate blood sugar levels and support weight loss, undermined DayTwo’s target market of diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. At the beginning of 2023, DayTwo’s cooperation with Maccabi and Clalit ended, and since then, new kits have not been available for purchase, although support for existing customers continued. Additionally, in 2023, the company sold its laboratory and transitioned to working exclusively with distributors in the U.S. At the end of 2022, DayTwo announced significant cutbacks, including the dismissal of dozens of employees in Israel and the U.S. At that time, the company employed 150 people, split equally between Israel and the U.S.",

After raising over $60 million, and a month after unveiling the Spacetop G1, the Israeli startup is parting ways with 20 of around 60 employees, announcing that it is shifting its focus from hardware distribution to software distribution Israeli startup Sightful, which develops a laptop using spatial computing to offer users an AR ‘monitor’ through the use of glasses, is laying off 20 employees, comprising a third of its workforce. The layoffs are part of a strategic decision to focus solely on software development and discontinue building and marketing a complete laptop. As a result, the company's hardware department has been disbanded. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Sightful, established in 2020 and revealed only a year ago with over $60 million in fundraising from Aleph, Symbol, and Corner Ventures, was considered one of Israel's most intriguing companies. Founded by Tamir Berliner and Tomer Kahan, who previously worked at Magic Leap and PrimeSense, the company developed a laptop that replaces the physical screen with AR glasses, allowing users to open dozens of virtual screens. This innovation enables comfortable work in public places without compromising privacy. Sightful started selling the computer, called \\\"Spacetop,\\\" about a year ago for $2,000 and recently relaunched it under the name Spacetop G1. Shortly after the relaunch and amid Apple's release of its AR glasses, Sightful decided to abandon the hardware component and focus on marketing the operating system and software for AR computers. The company says this shift is driven by rapid technological advancements in the computing market, highlighted by global tech giants' announcements of AI-based computers. According to Sightful, this change accelerates its business model, allowing the deployment of its operating system on various computers without being \\\"locked\\\" to its own device. “This is not the path the company intended, following so quickly on the heels of the announcement of Spacetop G1 - a product designed with the necessary hardware and compute to enable spatial computing in a laptop form factor. However, this rapid advancement in the broader market is very much aligned with the company’s long-term strategic vision, which has always been focused on software, bringing AR productivity to as many people as possible,” the company wrote in a press release. “Essentially, these market changes enabled an acceleration in Sigthful’s path. That acceleration has positive aspects including a significant increase in our total addressable market and faster speed to market, but also has negative aspects including the termination of valued employees.” Berliner, CEO and co-founder of Sightful, stated: \\\"The timing for implementing this strategy is earlier than we had planned, but as a dynamic startup, we must adjust and respond to changing market conditions, especially when they accelerate our plans. We continue to advocate for changing the 'mobile work world,' strongly believe in the power of augmented reality, and remain committed to our mission to free the laptop industry from the limitations of screens. This necessary shift in business focus means parting with a group of highly talented and groundbreaking individuals who were true partners in establishing our vision. We thank those who believed in us from the start and are doing everything we can to help them find new opportunities.\\\"",

At this stage, it is difficult to determine whether this is a trend, but it is possible that the move in both cases is related to the war in Israel. The current cut comes shortly after Pagaya published good financial reports for the first quarter of 2024, revealing revenues of $245.2 million, a 30% increase compared to the corresponding quarter. The increase in revenues contributed to an improvement in profitability, but the company still recorded a loss of $21.2 million in the quarter. Additionally, the company's stock, which trades in New York at a value of $790 million, was added to the Russell 2000 index. Those close to the company believe that the current cuts are intended to accelerate the transition to profitability and achieve positive cash flow. In recent months, Pagaya's management has been focusing on becoming a product company. Pagaya was founded in 2016 by Gal Krubiner, who serves as CEO, Avital Pardo, who serves as CTO, and Yahav Yulzari, the company's CRO. The three founders spend most of their time at the headquarters in the U.S., and the rest of the management is also American. The current move is led by Sanjiv Das, the president of Pagaya, who joined the company last October. The company went public through a merger with a SPAC at a valuation of $8 billion in 2022.",
        "Article Summary": "Pagaya currently employs 540 people, of which 400 are in Israel .<n>This is the second round of layoffs by Pagaya in a year and a half .<n>At the beginning of 2023, it fired 140 employees out of the 650 it employed ."

        "Extracted Article": "Cultivated meat startup Aleph Farms lays off 30% of staff. The difficulty in securing significant investment over the past year, coupled with a marked decrease in investor interest in alternative protein and cultivated meat, led to the layoffs The Israeli cultivated meat company Aleph Farms is laying off about 30 out of around 100 employees, amounting to 30% of the company's workforce. This comes despite the company's recent initial approval from the Ministry of Health for the marketing of its products (pre-marketing approval) and its emergence in recent years as one of the world's leading companies in the cultivated meat industry. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The difficulty in securing significant investment over the past year, coupled with a marked decrease in investor interest in alternative protein and cultivated meat, is now leading to cuts in the company. Aleph Farms had hoped for a different year, according to its strategic plan and promises made to investors. However, a source in the market noted, \\\"They expected a very significant expansion this year, but the situation in Israel is difficult for the entire market. All companies are re-examining their expenses.\\\" This is against the backdrop of a global decrease in investments in the alternative protein sector, with a much more significant drop in Israel due to the flight of investors amid political and security instability. In 2023, investment in alternative protein companies in Israel dropped by about 80%, compared to a 45% decrease globally. Aleph Farms was founded in 2017 by Didier Toubia, Dr. Neta Lavon, Professor Shulamit Levenberg from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at the Technion, and the Kitchen FoodTech Hub (a partnership of the Strauss Group and the Israel Innovation Authority). To date, it has raised approximately $140 million, one of the highest amounts in the field of alternative protein in Israel. The company introduced the world's first cultured beef steak in 2018, the world's first cultured entrecote steak in 2021, and cultured collagen in 2022. Aleph Farms has announced that it will launch its first commercial product, a cultured petite steak consisting mainly of plant materials alongside about 20% cultured meat cells, grown from cells of a Black Angus cow that have not undergone any genetic modification. The field of cultured meat, which is still largely in the research and development stages, is experiencing significant difficulties worldwide. Many of the largest and most promising companies in the field are retracting past promises and failing to establish factories and release products to the market, even after receiving various regulatory approvals. For example, two companies that sold products with low percentages of cultured meat in two restaurants in the USA have stopped marketing their products. One of them sold cultured chicken nuggets at a restaurant in Singapore one day a week but has since ceased. Now, the product has started to be marketed in one supermarket in limited quantities, containing only 1% cultured chicken, with the remaining ingredients being plant-based. Aleph Farms stated: \\\"As part of the process of developing the organization and expanding our focus from research and development in Israel to global production on a large scale in various markets, we are adjusting our team structure to match the current stage of the company. Unfortunately, this means saying goodbye to about 30% of our local employees. We are taking care of all the employees affected by this decision and will support them in their job search process.\\\"",

Amnon Shashua’s startup is laying off 100 employees, primarily in marketing and sales, four months after cutting 50 jobs  Only three months after firing 50 employees, Amnon Shashua's OrCam is cutting its workforce again. This time, the company will lay off 100 employees, primarily marketing personnel for its reading glasses for the blind in Israel and the USA. This represents about half of the remaining employees after the February layoffs. The company will now focus mainly on sales through distributors and continued development of hearing systems. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The reason for the cuts, according to estimates, is a sharp decrease in sales to Arab countries, some of which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. A significant portion of the expected revenue for the company, founded and managed by Amnon Shashua of Mobileye fame, comes from these countries. The company concluded that these effects will not subside until the end of 2024, complicating the planned IPO. OrCam stated: \\\"Due to the ongoing process of splitting the hearing and vision divisions, combined with a challenging business climate, the company is required to enhance efficiency processes. Reducing operating costs will help the company focus its activities, accelerate the transition to profitability, and prepare for raising capital when market conditions allow.\\\" While sources close to OrCam said the war also played a role in the drop in sales, the development of generative artificial intelligence technologies that perform functions similar to OrCam's reading device for the blind using smartphones has also contributed to this decision. As a result, the company, now managed by Elad Serfaty, has decided to concentrate on developing hearing aids. OrCam, founded by Shashua and Ziv Aviram, planned to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic after it approached a revenue rate of $100 million and profitability. In March 2021, it raised $50 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, aiming for a valuation above $2.5 billion in the IPO. However, these plans have stalled due to the war and the freeze on purchases from Arab countries, which were a significant growth engine for the Israeli company. At its peak, the company employed about 400 workers. It conducted the first round of layoffs at the end of 2022, laying off several dozen workers. In February 2024, it laid off 50 more workers, leaving 220 employees before the current round of layoffs.",

The Israeli startup raised $38 million since its founding in October 2017, but struggled to generate income and turned to the court due to its inability to pay its debts Israeli insurtech company Sproutt has declared insolvency less than three years after raising funding at a $200 million valuation. Last week, Sproutt submitted a request to the District Court in Tel Aviv to initiate proceedings due to its insolvency and its inability to pay a $2.2 million debt to Bank Leumi. Sproutt, established in October 2017, raised $38 million over the years and received investments from prominent insurance companies. Harel Insurance owns 4.5% of the company's shares, while Menorah Mitvtachim owns 3.5%. The deterioration of Sproutt, a digital insurance company specializing in marketing life insurance policies in the U.S., over the past three years is attributed, according to the company, to wrong strategic decisions resulting in heavy expenses and estimated losses of NIS 125 million (approximately $33 million). In addition to the debt to Leumi, the company's cash crunch also stems from debts to suppliers amounting to $740,000 and unpaid salaries for employees. Sproutt was founded by Yoav Shaham and Itai Brickner, each owning 4.2% of the company. In 2018, Sproutt founded a subsidiary called Aktibo, which centralized the company's activities in the U.S. Most of Sproutt's commercial engagements were conducted through Aktibo, allowing customers to define their lifestyle and reduce future payments based on their healthy lifestyle. However, the system did not generate enough revenue to cover marketing expenses due to several reasons, including minimal economic savings for consumers, a preference for purchasing policies through familiar insurance agents, and the high cost of marketing procedures. The commercial failure of Aktibo led to a strategic change in 2022, shifting from direct marketing to cooperation with agents and insurance agencies in the U.S. However, the cooperation with insurance agencies proved costly, jeopardizing the company's agreement with Reder Agency. Failure to make payments to Reder Agency may result in the loss of commission rights for Sproutt, as agents could utilize alternative contracts with insurance companies. The boom in investment in technology companies in 2020 and 2021 affected insurtech companies like Sproutt, but rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023 weighed heavily on insurance stocks and drew investment funds away from companies like Sproutt. Decreased investments, coupled with unsuccessful marketing ventures, led to the insolvency of the insurtech company.",

After being on the verge of an IPO in 2021, Cybereason has since seen its CEO resign, hundreds of employees get laid off, all while experiencing a 90% drop in value from $3 billion to $300 million Cybereason is set to cut dozens of jobs in what would be the third round of layoffs at the cybersecurity company. In previous waves of layoffs, the company terminated the employment of hundreds of employees. These layoffs are part of a significant reorganization that the company is undergoing, including a new strategic plan. As a result, Zohar Alon, who was appointed as President of Product and R&D less than a year ago, will also be leaving the company. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 After being on the verge of an IPO in 2021, Cybereason has since seen its CEO resign, hundreds of employees get laid off, as well as effectively get taken over by its main investor SoftBank, all while experiencing a 90% drop in value. Established in 2012 by Lior Div, Yonatan Striem-Amit, and Yossi Naar, Cybereason competes with companies such as Crowdstrike and SentinelOne, offering a variety of services including ransomware protection and prevention of malware attacks. Throughout its 11 years of operation, the company has raised $850 million, with the main investor being SoftBank. A significant achievement for the company was the company's funding round in 2021, in which it raised $325 million, led by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s investment fund Liberty Strategic Capital. Neuberger Berman, Irving and SoftBank also participated in the round. The company was ultimately valued at approximately $3.1 billion and even filed a prospectus for an IPO that year, expecting a valuation of $5 billion. However, the economic turmoil of 2022 caught the company by surprise and changed its trajectory. Amidst a global economic downturn, Cybereason, which at its peak employed about 1,500 workers, was forced to concede that it had over-hired employees. What's more, SoftBank, which was hit hard by its massive investment in WeWork, made it clear to all companies in which they invested that they would need to make immediate and massive cuts. Cybereason has since carried out two large rounds of layoffs, parting ways with a total of more than 300 employees, in addition to further significant cuts. In April of last year, it raised $100 million from SoftBank and Lior Div announced that he was resigning as CEO, and would be replaced by Eric Gan, a SoftBank executive with deep knowledge of the company. Div said that the company had enjoyed an excellent final quarter and that he was resigning because he wanted to focus on a new venture. However, according to a Delaware stock authorization form first noticed by Nasdaq Private Market and reported by Axios, the new Series G shares were sold at a price more than a 90% lower than the round in 2021, meaning the company was being valued at between $300-400 million.",

The Israeli company is a subsidiary of KLA Corporation after being acquired for $3.4 billion five years ago American company KLA informed more than 100 Orbotech employees in Yavne that they are being laid off following the closure of the FPD (flat panel display) division, Calcalist has learned. This was one of the two main divisions of Israeli company Orbotech, acquired by KLA in 2019 for $3.4 billion. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Orbotech specializes in developing systems for testing machines used in the production of printed circuits and flat screens, primarily selling to customers in the Far East. In recent years, KLA has experienced a slowdown across all its business sectors, prompting previous rounds of personnel cuts. Orbotech's traditional activities have exhibited notable weakness in recent quarters. The entire division dedicated to test systems for printed circuits and flat panel displays accounted for only about 3% of KLA's revenues, totaling $283 million in 2023, representing a 48% decrease. When combined with revenues from other services provided by Orbotech, annual turnover reached half a billion dollars, but even this figure reflects a sharp decline of 34%. The weakness in this sector mainly reflects a slowdown in investments and demand in the consumer electronics market. KLA stated in response: \\\"KLA announced today a strategic decision to close the equipment division for flat panel display manufacturers due to a continuous decline in this market and the cancellation of a project with a major customer. We are committed to providing continued support to existing customers, as we have already informed them. We maintain our full commitment to our business activities in other divisions and to the demands of the electronics, advanced packaging, and components market, preparing for renewed growth across all areas of the company's activities, in accordance with forecasts.\\\"",

The vast majority of the people being laid off are based in Israel, with the company summoning about 40 employees from the Israeli branch to a hearing on Monday. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Melio said that the employees who will be laid off will receive increased compensation packages, professional guidance in the job search process, as well as improved conditions for purchasing options.

Melio employed around 650 people prior to the layoffs, including 400 in Israel.

The development department alone grew from about 50 employees to around 300 over that period. Matan Bar, CEO of Melio, said: \\\"This is a difficult day for us. Accelerated growth as we have experienced in recent years is welcome, but it is the management's responsibility to examine all the time whether the organizational structure that has worked so far will serve us well for our goals in the future as well. In our case, we are forced to make a difficult but necessary decision, and unfortunately, as a result of the structural change, we also have to say goodbye to employees. At the same time, there is no change in our goals for 2024, and we are convinced that this year, as every year, we will meet our ambitious goals.\\\" Bar added, \\\"We have plans for accelerated growth in the coming years - even faster than the growth we've experienced to date - but we won't be able to realize them if we don't take responsibility for our efficiency and organizational focus. Again and again, we are included in the lists of promising companies in the global fintech market - our responsibility is to realize this promise.\\\"",

Amnon Shashua’s startup is laying off 100 employees, primarily in marketing and sales, four months after cutting 50 jobs  Only three months after firing 50 employees, Amnon Shashua's OrCam is cutting its workforce again. This time, the company will lay off 100 employees, primarily marketing personnel for its reading glasses for the blind in Israel and the USA. This represents about half of the remaining employees after the February layoffs. The company will now focus mainly on sales through distributors and continued development of hearing systems. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The reason for the cuts, according to estimates, is a sharp decrease in sales to Arab countries, some of which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. A significant portion of the expected revenue for the company, founded and managed by Amnon Shashua of Mobileye fame, comes from these countries. The company concluded that these effects will not subside until the end of 2024, complicating the planned IPO. OrCam stated: \\\"Due to the ongoing process of splitting the hearing and vision divisions, combined with a challenging business climate, the company is required to enhance efficiency processes. Reducing operating costs will help the company focus its activities, accelerate the transition to profitability, and prepare for raising capital when market conditions allow.\\\" While sources close to OrCam said the war also played a role in the drop in sales, the development of generative artificial intelligence technologies that perform functions similar to OrCam's reading device for the blind using smartphones has also contributed to this decision. As a result, the company, now managed by Elad Serfaty, has decided to concentrate on developing hearing aids. OrCam, founded by Shashua and Ziv Aviram, planned to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic after it approached a revenue rate of $100 million and profitability. In March 2021, it raised $50 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, aiming for a valuation above $2.5 billion in the IPO. However, these plans have stalled due to the war and the freeze on purchases from Arab countries, which were a significant growth engine for the Israeli company. At its peak, the company employed about 400 workers. It conducted the first round of layoffs at the end of 2022, laying off several dozen workers. In February 2024, it laid off 50 more workers, leaving 220 employees before the current round of layoffs.",

The LiDAR technology developer is laying off around 60 people with the aim of reducing cash outlays by $22-24 million on an annualized basis LiDAR technology developer Innoviz announced on Wednesday that it is laying off 13% of its workforce. Around 60 employees are set to leave the company, which employs a total of 468 people, mostly in its headquarters in Rosh Ha’ayin in Israel, as well as in Europe and the U.S. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Innoviz said the “realignment actions” to be implemented during the first quarter of 2024 are expected to reduce cash outlays by $22-24 million on an annualized basis. Savings are expected to be derived primarily from the transition of the InnovizOne program to series production and concentration of future investments on the InnovizTwo sensor and perception software suite. \\\"Innoviz is at an important point in its growth trajectory,\\\" said Omer Keilaf, Innoviz Co-Founder and CEO. \\\"The Company is in a market capture window that has the potential to determine the market share of the LiDAR industry for the next decade or more. Today's actions are the result of a thoughtful process to optimize the company's cost structure, increase our competitive positioning, and extend our cash runway through the expected remainder of the market capture window. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals and become a market leader in automotive LiDAR.\\\" Innoviz, which has a market cap of under $300 million after losing over 55% of its value over the last six months, is still deep in the red. The company registered revenues of just $3.5 million in Q3 of 2023, which was up 138% compared to revenues of $1.5 million in Q2 2023 and up 297% compared to revenues of $0.9 million in Q3 2022. Operating expenses in Q3 2023 were $27.8 million. Since 2021, Innoviz has simultaneously funded the development of two production path programs – the InnovizOne and InnovizTwo LiDAR sensor and perception software suites. With the InnovizOne program now transitioned from the development phase into full series production, the company decided to eliminate duplicative cost structures and significantly reduce its spending on InnovizOne development, while reinvesting a portion of the savings into the InnovizTwo sensor. The company also said that it is reducing its investments in initiatives that have meaningful upfront cash outlays and lengthy time horizons before achieving commercialization and securing sizeable series production volumes. These initiatives include the Minimum Risk Maneuver (MRM) software solution and the InnovizCore AI compute module, along with other previously unannounced initiatives.",

As part of a plan, the company anticipates that approximately 800 employees will be laid off, which is approximately 90% of the total workforce.

Vroom was established in 2013 by a pair of American entrepreneurs, but a year later Israelis Elie Wurtman and Allon Bloch took it over and turned the company from a used car trading business to an online platform dealing with the purchase, repair, and sale of vehicles.

        "Extracted Article": "SolarEdge to embark on massive layoffs, cutting 900 jobs amid sharp drop in revenue. The renewable energy company, which has seen its valuation fall by 80%, is expecting its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 to be 55% lower than the third quarter, which were themselves 27% less than the second quarter SolarEdge is embarking on an extensive cutback program that includes laying off 900 employees, 550 of which are based in Israel. The company employs about 5,500 people, meaning it will be cutting around 16% of its total workforce. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 This decision comes amid a sharp decline in SolarEdge's revenues. The renewable energy company previously said that it expects its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 to amount to approximately $325 million— 55% lower than the revenues in the third quarter. The announcement surprised analysts, who were predicting a drop in revenue, but not to such an extent. The revenues presented in the third quarter, $725 million, were also 27% lower than the revenues of the second quarter, which were $991 million. SolarEdge’s fall from grace has been especially painful, with the company being part of the S&P 500 up until two months ago. The company, which produces systems for managing solar installations, attributes the decrease in revenue to the postponement of orders and cancellations from customers and distributors in Europe, along with an increase in inventory. Additionally, SolarEdge faces a difficult macro environment which is challenging for renewable energy companies in general. The high interest rate made financing projects very expensive, and the renewable energy industry is highly sensitive to such an increase in price. This must be added to the increase in the prices of goods and raw materials. All of these factors led to a decrease in demand for installing systems, especially in the private market. A change in tax incentives in the U.S. and Europe also contributed to the damage to demand. The decline in revenues resulted in a sharp drop in the value of SolarEdge. Last Friday, despite the positive trend in the U.S. markets, the energy company's stock fell and reached a four-and-a-half-year low since September 2019. The company's market value is currently estimated at $3.9 billion, a far cry from the record value of $20 billion which it reached in mid-2022, becoming the largest Israeli company on Wall Street. Additionally, last week, the investment bank Barclays lowered the target price of SolarEdge shares to $50, a price 29% lower than the share price at the closing of trading on Friday ($69.1). Nevertheless, investment behemoth BlackRock has decided to increase its stake in SolarEdge over recent months, with a report to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing that it held a 15.8% stake in SolarEdge at the end of 2023, up from 9% in its previous report in April 2023. Zvi Lando, Chief Executive Officer of SolarEdge, said, “We have made a very difficult, but necessary decision to implement a workforce reduction and other cost-cutting measures in order to align our cost structure with the rapidly changing market dynamics. We are making every effort to treat our departing colleagues with respect and gratitude for their contributions and support them in their transition. We remain confident in the long-term growth of the solar energy market and our leading position in the smart energy space. These changes do not impact our strategic direction and priorities and we remain committed to continue to drive the renewable energy transformation, while providing best in class technology and support to our customers.”",

Sisense has seen its team shrink by half since 2022, with 60 jobs now set to be cut after 100 employees were let go last July  Six months after laying off 100 employees, business intelligence unicorn Sisense has embarked on another round of layoffs. Sisense is parting ways with around 60 employees, accounting for approximately 13% of its remaining workforce. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Sisense employed as many as 800 people in 2022, but following the latest round of cutbacks will remain with a team of around just 400 employees. The current layoffs are another shock in a long series of developments at Sisense that began with the departure of senior executives in 2022, followed by relatively small-scale layoffs and a halt in recruitment. In 2022, Sisense reduced its workforce from 800 employees to 600 employees, and many of the company's early employees left. Alongside the downsizing, Sisense changed its business focus several times, shifting from developing analytics tools for businesses to focusing solely on large enterprises, and then deciding to concentrate on integrating analytics tools into other corporate software. At the end of April of last year, the company announced the appointment of Ariel Katz as CEO in place of Amir Orad, who shifted to the role of Chairman. Katz had joined a year earlier as Chief Products and Technology Officer and General Manager of Israel. Sisense, which reported reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $150 million last year, is an established company that was founded back in 2004. It reached a valuation of a billion dollars in 2019 with a $100 million funding round led by Insight Partners. Aside from Insight, the main investors in Sisense are renowned venture capital funds such as Bessemer Ventures Partners, Battery Ventures, and Access. Sisense said in response: “This reduction in staff was undertaken after careful deliberations to enable the company’s continued long-term growth and stability. We are focused on investing in our go-forward strategy of broadening our offerings for technical buyers, enabling our customers to build custom analytics faster than ever before. We truly appreciate the contribution of our employees and the company is providing transitional benefits packages and support as they search for their next opportunities. While we realize that we are in a fortunate position as a company, having reached positive cash flow however, considering the current economic realities, these adjustments are necessary.”",

Orca, which has raised $640 million to date and was last valued at $1.8 billion, is parting ways with around 60 employees  Israeli cyber unicorn Orca Security is laying off around 60 employees, accounting for approximately 15% of its total workforce, Calcalist has learned. Half of those laid off will be from Israel, and the remainder from locations around the world, including London, Portland, Bangkok, and other offices in the U.S. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Orca, which employs around 430 people, said it plans to offer some of the affected employees to remain in the company in alternative positions. Since its establishment, Orca Security has raised $640 million and, in its latest fundraising round in 2021, achieved a valuation of $1.8 billion. Among its investors are the Singaporean Temasek fund, YL Ventures, Alphabet's independent growth fund CapitalG, Redpoint Ventures, GGV, ICONIQ Capital, Lone Pine Capital, Stripes, Adams Street Partners, Willoughby Capital, and Harmony Partners. Last July, Orca, founded by Check Point veterans, filed a lawsuit against Assaf Rappaport's Wiz, which he founded with other Adallom veterans. In the lawsuit filed in the District Court of Delaware in the U.S., Orca argued that it has evidence demonstrating that Wiz built its business through willful infringement of Orca's intellectual property. Orca asserts that it developed and began marketing the product before Wiz, and that Wiz copied its patents. Orca Security was founded in 2019 by Avi Shua, Gil Geron, Matan Ben Gur, Liran Antebi, Hadas Amitay, Wagde Zabit, Shay Filosof, and Eti Spiegel-Khobra, all of whom are former employees of Check Point. Orca stated, \\\"Orca has achieved an all-time high in terms of the number of customers, revenue growth of hundreds of percent since the last capital raising, and high customer satisfaction according to surveys. Alongside these accomplishments, including our designation as a global AWS security partner, we, like other companies, are compelled to enhance efficiency during this period. We are currently undergoing a reorganization process, bidding farewell to exceptional individuals who have played a pivotal role in Orca's success. Depending on the reorganization, some employees may find positions within the company in different capacities. Additionally, Orca continues its expansion and recruitment efforts for growing departments within the company.\\\"",

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Dealtale was purchased last May, just two years after it was founded, for a sum of a little over $20 million in cash. The company, which had previously raised just $1.7 million, developed a platform to analyze and optimize customer journeys to enhance the capabilities of sales, marketing, and product professionals. Dealtale was founded by CEO Ariel Geifman, VP R&D Aviran Moshe, CTO Adi Mizrahi, and CFO and COO Nir Goldberg. At the time of the acquisition, Vianai said it intends to expand its local R&D center and hire dozens of additional employees. Vianai, which has raised $190 million to date, was founded by Vishal Sikka, the former CEO of Infosys and CTO of SAP. The company shifted its business focus over recent months, putting its chips on generative AI. In April, it launched hila, an AI-powered chat assistant for institutional and retail investors, investment banking analysts, and other investment professionals. This also meant that the products Dealtale was working on became more expendable for the company, so much so that Vianai ceased its operations completely.",

The Israeli startup is parting ways with around 150 employees. “The only way to give the company a fighting chance of survival and getting back to a path of sustainable growth is to keep on a small core of people that represent bare operational necessity,” wrote CEO Yaniv Bertele Under fire Vesttoo is laying off around 150 employees, accounting for 75% of the company’s workforce. Most of the company’s employees are headquartered in Israel. Check out all Vesttoo related articles Calcalist uncovered last month that the allegedly fake letters of credit (LOCs) provided by investors to insurers for reinsurance transactions on the Vesttoo platform are believed to total a sum of around $4 billion. The fraud came to light when one of the LOCs was found to be fake, leading to a comprehensive review of all letters of credit issued by the company. The Israeli startup released a statement last week admitting that “at a minimum, it appears that Vesttoo’s procedures were circumvented.” “I am writing to you today with great sorrow, to inform you that we have reached the incredibly difficult decision to part ways with many of our people, across all teams and geographies at Vesttoo, and I would like to share the considerations that led to this very painful choice,” CEO Yaniv Bertele wrote in an email to employees. “Over the last two weeks we have looked at many different options with a primary purpose in mind: ensuring that Vesttoo weathers this storm in a way that makes rebuilding possible. In spite of this serious crisis, we have never lost faith in the sound foundations of our approach to revolutionizing the reinsurance industry by better connecting the insurance and capital markets by combining AI-powered technology and expertise in data science, insurance risk transfer and finance. “As we considered our options, we had to recognize two important facts: 1. We do not know how long this process will take, and 2. The amount of runway we have. These two factors led to the unavoidable conclusion that the only way to give the company a fighting chance of survival and getting back to a path of sustainable growth is to keep on a small core of people that represent bare operational necessity. These changes are meant to preserve, and focus on Vesttoo’s core services, our data-driven solution and marketplace, and providing solutions for our affected clients. “With regards to the investigation, the company is doing all it can to determine how and where the fraudulent LOCs originated. At a minimum, it appears that Vesttoo’s procedures were circumvented by external parties but we are committed to understanding the full picture of what happened. This is why we have engaged an experienced investigations team and external attorneys to advise us throughout this process.” Clear Blue Insurance Group was among the companies which released statements last week aimed at reassuring their clients in the wake of the Vesttoo scandal. Clear Blue and Vesttoo announced a partnership in August 2022 through which the Israeli startup was set to deploy as much as $1 billion from the capital markets through Clear Blue’s property and casualty programs. Clear Blue confirmed that it is aware of the allegations and that the “letters of credit issued by the China Construction Bank for reinsurance collateral, on behalf of Vesttoo, are fraudulent.” It said it has been using Vesttoo for reinsurance since early 2022.",

        "Extracted Article": "Declining results, a crashing stock, and a CEO under duress - what is going on at AudioCodes?. The Covid-19 pandemic propelled AudioCodes, which specializes in communication solutions for digital work environments, to a record valuation of over $1.3 billion in 2020. The founder had plans for an exit, but that led to a conflict with an old friend, and as the epidemic waned, demand weakened, and the company's stock plummeted The troubles at Audiocodes are taking a toll on its shareholders. In May, the company, which provides communication solutions for digital work environments, lowered its revenue forecast for the current year. During an analyst call held after the publication of the first-quarter 2023 results, the CEO and largest shareholder, Shabtai Adlersberg (14.1%), stated that Audiocodes' revenues for 2023 would range between $240 million and $250 million. This represents a 16% decrease compared to the previous forecast and a 12% decrease compared to the 2022 revenues. The downward revision in forecast followed the company's announcement in April that it expected a decrease in net profit in the first quarter of the year. The quarterly report also presented lukewarm results for Audiocodes. Revenues amounted to $59.2 million, a 10.8% decrease compared to the $66.4 million generated in the first quarter of 2022. This decline in revenues resulted in a transition from a net profit of $8.6 million to a loss of $200,000. Against the backdrop of deteriorating results, the company's stock, traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, has recorded a 40% decrease since the beginning of the year and a 65% decrease since the start of 2020, making it the second-worst performing stock on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange during this period. Presently, Audiocodes trades at a market value of NIS 1.2 billion ($330 million), which is 75% lower than its record value of NIS 4.8 billion ($1.3 billion) in July 2020. Audiocodes was founded in 1993 by Adlersberg and Leon Bialik after the two left DSP. The company develops and markets voice function solutions that facilitate collaboration between different applications such as Zoom and Teams. Microsoft is a prominent partner of Audiocodes. In recent years, the company has also ventured into developing artificial intelligence products for voice recognition in internet chats, as well as products for recording, transcribing, and analyzing meetings within and outside organizations. Due to its focus on remote work solutions, Audiocodes experienced a surge in its stock value during the pandemic. The widespread belief that remote work would become a fundamental aspect of work, in general, led to a significant increase in demand for the company's products. However, recent months have seen Audiocodes grappling with a decline in product demand. This decrease can be attributed to several factors, including the gradual return of employees to physical offices, reduced reliance on remote work, and increased competition, particularly from cloud-based solutions that reduce companies' dependence on Audiocodes' products. The management of Audiocodes attributes the decrease in product demand in Europe and the U.S. to economic uncertainty caused by rising interest rates aimed at combating high inflation levels worldwide. In light of these circumstances, the company announced plans to lay off 8-10% of its employees this year, resulting in 80 immediate job terminations, equivalent to 6% of its workforce. Additionally, Audiocodes is relocating its management headquarters from Airport City to Or Yehuda to reduce rental costs. In 2020, during a period when Audiocodes traded at its peak value, several attempts were made to find a buyer for the company, with potential acquirers aiming to gain controlling ownership and potentially delist the company from public trading. Audiocodes lacks a controlling nucleus, despite Adlersberg being the largest shareholder. Various local and international parties approached investment funds to present acquisition offers and acquire a controlling interest in Audiocodes. Adlersberg himself also sought assistance from an international investment bank to explore options for bringing in a large entity as the controlling owner of Audiocodes. However, none of these attempts materialized into a deal. These efforts led to a conflict between Adlersberg and Avi Alkalay, owner of the Hadas Institute. Alkalay attempted to interest one of the world's largest investment funds, Permira, which previously acquired Israeli company Netafim, in acquiring controlling ownership of Audiocodes. Alkalay reached out to the director of Permira's operations in Israel, Ran Maidan, former CEO of Netafim. Although the appeal did not result in a deal, Alkalay demanded a fee of half a million dollars from Audiocodes and Adlersberg. According to Alkalay's letter, he made multiple unsuccessful attempts to find a buyer for the company due to a lack of cooperation from the CEO and his old friend, Adlersberg. Consequently, Alkalay demanded compensation of half a million dollars for his efforts. Audiocodes considers Alkalay's demand an extortion attempt, as he allegedly threatened to reveal personal details about Adlersberg's life and his relationship with a top executive at the company. Alkalay claimed that the executive's salary significantly increased over the years due to her relationship with Adlersberg and threatened to expose this information, among other things. An insider close to Adlersberg stated: \\\"He heard personal details about Adlersberg's life while spending time together with their families, and he is trying to exploit that. He is under financial pressure and trying to extract whatever he can from Adlersberg.\\\" Alkalay denies facing any financial difficulties and added that Adlersberg himself approached him twice to find a buyer for controlling ownership of the company but avoided entering into negotiations when potential buyers were found. The current decline in Audiocodes' stock prompted the company to approve an undisclosed share buyback plan this year to support the stock price. The repurchases are expected to amount to tens of millions of dollars. This is a reverse strategy from June 2020, when the stock was at its peak, and Audiocodes conducted a secondary offering on the Nasdaq, selling shares at $35 per share. Presently, the stock price stands at only $8, allowing Audiocodes to repurchase shares at a lower price than they were initially issued. While this move may provide some consolation for investors selling their shares, it comes after a three-year period during which the company lost 75% of its value compared to its peak and erased billions of shekels from its market capitalization.",

The current layoffs are another shock in a long series of negative developments at Sisense, beginning with the departure of senior executives last year and followed by relatively small-scale layoffs and a halt in recruitment Less than three months after announcing the retirement of Amir Orad from the position of CEO, software company Sisense is embarking on an extensive round of layoffs. Calcalist has learned that Sisense is set to part ways with 100 employees, which make up about 15% of the workforce. The move will affect all departments, including the Israeli headquarters, which employs 150 people and where hearings began last week. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 The current layoffs are another shock in a long series of developments at Sisense that began with the departure of senior executives last year, followed by relatively small-scale layoffs and a halt in recruitment. In 2022, Sisense reduced its workforce from 800 employees to 600 employees, and many of the company's early employees left. Alongside the downsizing, Sisense changed its business focus several times, shifting from developing analytics tools for businesses to focusing solely on large enterprises, and then deciding to concentrate on integrating analytics tools into other corporate software. At the end of April, the company announced the appointment of Ariel Katz as CEO. Katz had joined a year earlier as Chief Products and Technology Officer and General Manager of Israel. Sisense is an established company that was founded back in 2004. Eight years ago, Orad, who was not part of the founding team, joined to manage the company, and in 2019, he helped make the company one of the first to reach a valuation of a billion dollars with a $100 million funding round led by Insight Partners. The main investors in Sisense, apart from Insight, are renowned venture capital funds such as Bessemer Ventures Partners, Battery Ventures, and Access. Shortly after the recruitment, Sisense began preparing for an IPO on Wall Street, but this plan never came to fruition due to the company's inability to stabilize revenues. Since the 2019 round, Sisense has not completed any additional capital raises and has instead financed itself through credit. Sisense reported reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $150 million earlier this year and positive EBITDA over the previous two quarters. The company even achieved positive cash flow, which allows it to refrain from raising money at this stage. However, despite the seemingly high revenue rate, Sisense didn’t register the same rate of growth compared to the previous year, which is one of the reasons for the current layoffs. The new CEO is planning another change in the company's business direction that will involve marketing to developers who will integrate its business intelligence tools at the code stage as an integral part of the software. \\\"Like any responsible company during this period, and in order to maintain the growth and level of profitability that we have sustained for a significant period of time, we realized that efficiency measures are necessary within the company. We are committed to helping the employees who are leaving find their next workplace, and providing them with all the support they need during this challenging period,\\\" Katz said in response to Calcalist's inquiry. \\\"As a leading company in the world of embedded analytics, we continue to work on new growth engines and leverage products to strengthen our leadership for years to come, and build an organization that aligns with our goals, which include both growth and profitability.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Healthtech startup DayTwo facing uncertain future after dramatic restructuring. The Israeli startup, which raised $85 million mainly from co-founder Marius Nacht, has reduced its staff by over 75% over the past year and is hoping to sell its technology to another company After much buzz and hype, Israeli nutrition company DayTwo is nearing the end of its journey. The company, co-founded and primarily funded by Marius Nacht, is reducing most of its operations and retaining only a small core team for development and customer service in Israel and the U.S., according to Calcalist's sources. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 The aim is to provide support to existing customers and potentially sell its technology to an external party. The company employed 150 staff in 2022, but currently only has 35 employees remaining, with 20 in Israel and 15 in the U.S. DayTwo raised $85 million to develop and market kits that personalized proper nutrition for diabetic patients based on their stool samples. The company's unique approach meant it would sometimes recommend foods like pizza, hamburgers with fries, or bread with butter, which it believed could be healthier for certain individuals. Through genetic analysis and sugar tests, the system provided personalized adjustments to food choices. While DayTwo demonstrated positive results in improving sugar levels, weight loss outcomes were inconclusive. Criticism also arose over the recommendation of foods that, despite their sugar-lowering benefits, were deemed unhealthy. Despite initial enthusiasm and marketing through Israeli HMOs Maccabi and Clalit, who charged a one-time payment for the kits, the company's business model failed to generate profitability. Two years ago, CEO Lihi Segal, one of the founders, departed, and Dave Henderson, an American CEO, took over. The plan was to enter the U.S. market and adopt a subscription model with organizations and insurance companies, some of which signed agreements with the company. However, the emergence of diabetes injections like Ozempic, which offer both sugar level management and weight loss benefits, undermined DayTwo's target population. Starting in 2023, cooperation between DayTwo and Maccabi and Clalit came to an end and it is no longer possible to order new kits. Only support for existing customers is provided. Calcalist also discovered that the company recently sold its laboratory and shifted operations to the U.S. through distributors. At the end of 2022, a significant downsizing took place, resulting in the dismissal of dozens of employees in both Israel and the U.S. DayTwo conducted further layoffs in recent weeks, including senior personnel. Established in 2015, DayTwo was among the first and most prominent investments of Marius Nacht, one of Check Point's three founders, upon his transition into the medical field. The founding team also included CEO Lihi Segal (until 2021) and Yuval Ofek, who served as chairman. The current chairman is Yair Briman. Notable investors in the company include Nacht and Yair Schindel's aMoon fund, 10D, Cathay Innovation Ventures, Poalim Capital Markets, La’maison Fund, and Micron Ventures. In 2018, basketball player Omri Casspi also made an undisclosed investment after using DayTwo's kit and becoming its presenter in the Israeli market. The company stated: \\\"Like any startup, we constantly adjust our business model and personnel structure accordingly. For instance, our main solution in the U.S. is transitioning to a digital-based approach without dietitians, and we have introduced a new sales channel through distributors. R&D remains in Israel and continues to lead product development and research.\\\"",

The Israeli-founded company went public in October through a SPAC merger at a valuation of $1.2 billion, but currently has a market cap of around just $120 million Hospitality company Selina is facing significant challenges regarding its future. Just eight months after its IPO, Selina finds itself in a position of laying off employees, halting expansion plans, and urgently seeking additional funding. As of the end of March, the company's cash balance was a mere $23 million. Today, Selina announced substantial cost-cutting measures, including the termination of approximately 350 employees, the closure of several properties, and a near-complete suspension of new hotel openings. These actions are aimed at mitigating the cash drain, which led to a substantial loss of $200 million despite generating $183 million in revenue in 2022. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Selina, founded in 2015 by Rafael Museri and Daniel Rudasevski, went public in October through a SPAC merger at a valuation of $1.2 billion, raising $54 million. However, the company's market cap currently hovers around just $120 million. CEO Rafael Museri spoke with Calcalist and acknowledged the need for a change in Selina's organizational culture, stating, \\\"The market has shifted its focus from valuing growth to prioritizing profitability. Consequently, Selina's approach needs to adapt.\\\" Museri further explained that instead of pursuing frequent deals and opening numerous hotels, Selina will no longer open new properties and will even close unprofitable ones. After the current round of layoffs, Selina will retain approximately 2,000 employees, consolidating its headquarters from eight different offices into one, with some employees working remotely. This cost-cutting plan is projected to result in $5.8 million in savings starting from the second quarter of 2023, alongside a one-time expenditure of $1 million for severance payments. In the first quarter of 2023, Selina reported revenues of $54.2 million, representing a 32% increase compared to the same quarter last year and a slight increase compared to the previous quarter. Excluding the new hotels, revenues increased by 18%. The occupancy rate rose to 57% compared to 45% in the corresponding period last year. However, the company still incurred a total loss of $30.3 million, although it improved from $38.3 million in the previous year's quarter. The company's free cash flow before debt service was $12.6 million, down from $14.3 million in Q1 of 2022. During the first quarter, Selina did not open any new hotels and concluded the period with 118 properties and 29,600 beds. The company has begun the process of exiting from underperforming properties and has already closed five sites in Mexico, the USA, Greece, Austria, and Costa Rica. Selina intends to release an updated forecast for 2023 with a lower growth rate than the previously projected 30-40%. Simultaneously, Selina announced a funding agreement with Global University Systems (GUS), a remote learning platform operator, to raise a total of $50 million. In the initial stage, Selina will receive $10 million from GUS, which will become a strategic investor in Selina and be granted two seats on the board of directors. It remains unclear which of the existing eight directors will step down to accommodate the new members. If Selina successfully secures an additional $20 million from other investors, GUS will provide an additional $20 million. The fundraising will involve privately issued shares at a 10% discount on the market price and convertible bonds. Selina is currently in negotiations with other investors, including existing ones, to raise $20 million. Furthermore, Selina drew $10 million from a credit line of $50 million in late May and restructured the repayment of a loan it acquired for expansion in South America when it was still a private company. As part of the restructuring, the debt was converted into Selina shares.",

The fintech company, which is traded on Nasdaq with a market cap of around $1.7 billion, is mainly laying off employees from the marketing and service departments Four months after appointing a new CEO, Israeli fintech company Payoneer is embarking on a significant round of layoffs. The company, which is traded on Nasdaq with a market cap of around $1.7 billion, will part ways with 200 employees, which make up about 10% of its workforce. At this stage, the final number of those laid off in Israel is not known. About half of Payoneer’s approximately 2,000 employees are based in Israel, where most of its R&D takes place. The cutbacks are set to get underway this week. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Payoneer, established in 2005, was over the years one of the most promising unicorns in Israel. The company operates in the payments and clearing market for small and medium-sized businesses, estimated by the company at $5 trillion. Payoneer's business model is based on collecting a commission from the payments made on its platform, which operates in 190 countries. Recently, it also launched a dedicated solution in partnership with the credit card giant Mastercard. Payoneer went public through a merger with a SPAC on Nasdaq at a value of $3.3 billion in June 2021. The company raised over a billion dollars in the process, some of which went to the company's coffers and some to the founders and longtime shareholders, including former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who invested in the company early on. The layoffs at Payoneer come both against the backdrop of the macroeconomic situation and due to the management's desire to move towards profitable growth. For example, in the first quarter of 2023, the volume of payments between businesses made on Payoneer's platform was lower than expected. Most of the layoffs are expected to focus on the marketing and service departments, while the impact on the development sector will be low, which also means that the number of employees laid off in Israel is expected to be relatively small. Payoneer announced in March that after nine months as co-CEO alongside veteran CEO Scott Galit, John Caplan will become the company’s full-time CEO. Galit, who served in senior positions at Payoneer for 12 years and led its IPO, remained on the board of directors. At the same time, a new CFO (Bea Ordonez) was also appointed. The new management announced a new strategy which would focus on large and profitable customers and building a new generation of its payments platform. Upon taking office, the new CEO noted that a quarter of Payoneer's customers generate the most revenues and activity, so from now on, marketing and services will be focused on these half a million customers. The company then revealed in its financial reports for the first quarter that it stopped hiring as of May 1, which should save it $5 million by the end of 2023. Ordonez also added that the company is actively examining its cost structure to reduce unnecessary positions in the organization without harming development. Payoneer is expected to finish 2023 with a growth rate of about 30%, bringing it to revenues of $810-820 million. After recording a bottom line loss in 2022, Payoneer started the first quarter on the right foot with a net profit of $8 million, part of which was due to interest income on a cash fund of half a billion dollars. Payoneer stated in response: \\\"Like any responsible company, Payoneer examines measures to make the organization more accurate. In addition, we are recruiting dozens of developers and product managers in Israel to build our financial cloud.\\\" Source close to Payoneer also added that the plan to recruit 150 employees for the development center in Israel, which the company announced in March, is still in effect.",

According to a statement from the Joonko board, CEO Ilit Raz “was found to have engaged in egregious, unethical and fraudulent conduct, which caused harm to the company and its shareholders.” Joonko raised a $25 million Series B last September led by Insight Partners, with support from Target Global Israeli startup Joonko, which has developed an automated sourcing platform focused solely on underrepresented candidates, is on the verge of a shock closure. An investigation conducted by the company's board of directors and investors revealed that the number of its real customers differed significantly from the number reported by its managers to the investors. In those reports, the company stated that it has 150 customers, when in practice the number was significantly smaller. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 The company's CEO Ilit Raz and a number of senior executives have already left the company in recent weeks and most of the company's employees have been called in for a hearing ahead of their dismissal. According to a statement from the Joonko board, “The CEO was found to have engaged in egregious, unethical and fraudulent conduct, which caused harm to the company and its shareholders.” Joonko raised a $25 million Series B last September led by Insight Partners, with support from Target Global and existing investors, including Kapor Capital. The company, which has raised a total of $38 million to date, employed around 50 people at its peak and it remains unclear how many will remain following the extensive layoffs. “Insight does not tolerate, and our investors expect us to take seriously, any findings of misconduct, deceit or unlawful activity at our firm or any of our portfolio companies,” Insight Partners said in a statement. Ilit Raz and the company did not respond to requests for comment. Joonko’s recruitment solution assists companies in achieving their diversity, equity and inclusion goals through its ecosystem that identifies and suggests pre-qualified candidates from across a range of underrepresented sectors, saving recruiters time on sourcing, attracting, and validating relevant candidates. Joonko connects with the applicant tracking systems of partner companies to spot pre-qualified candidates and resurface them as recommended talent anywhere in the Joonko ecosystem. According to previous announcements by Joonko, employers like Adidas, Accenture, American Express, Crocs, PayPal, Northwestern Mutual, and Intuit rely on its automated sourcing platform. “The company was recently made aware of misstatements in the financial reporting of the company. Specifically, the board and other executive officers of the company lost confidence in the CEO’s ability to deliver on repeated requests to develop and support an internal finance function as part of the maturation of the company and its business,” Joonko’s board said in a statement. “As a result, the board and other executive officers of the company carried out an extensive review of the CEO’s performance. The CEO was found to have engaged in egregious, unethical and fraudulent conduct, which caused harm to the company and its shareholders. The CEO was confronted with the findings of the investigation, and she voluntarily resigned in response. The extent of the situation remains under investigation and next steps are under consideration.” Insight Partners said in a statement: “Insight takes pride in being a supportive partner for entrepreneurs and leadership teams on their growth journey and has an unwavering commitment to upholding the highest standards of ethics, accountability, and responsible leadership. “Insight does not tolerate, and our investors expect us to take seriously, any findings of misconduct, deceit or unlawful activity at our firm or any of our portfolio companies. “The company's board of directors stated that the CEO was found to have engaged in blatant, unethical and fraudulent conduct that caused damage to the company and its shareholders.

The internet recommendation platform is laying off around 90 employees after firing 38 people last summer Israeli-founded company Outbrain, which has developed a recommendation platform for the open web, is laying off around 90 employees, accounting for 10% of its total workforce. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Outbrain raised $160 million at a $1.12 billion valuation in its IPO two years ago, but currently has a market cap of just $236 million. The company laid off 38 employees last July after raising $200 million in funding from Boston-based investment manager The Baupost Group. Outbrain registered revenue of $231.8 million in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $22.4 million, or 9%, compared to $254.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower revenue of approximately $51.6 million due to net revenue retention of 80% on existing media partners. The company explained that lower yields were mainly the result of weaker demand on the platform, primarily as a result of the current macroeconomic conditions and the impact on advertising spend, as well as due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. In all, the company recorded a net loss of $5.6 million, compared to net loss of $1.9 million in the prior year period. \\\"Today we shared some difficult news with the company's employees, when we decided to say goodbye to about 10% of Outbrain's global workforce,” Outbrain said in a statement. “The past year has brought with it rapid changes in the industry and sector, including reductions in personnel. In light of this, we have taken several steps to streamline the company's operations, which will give us the tools to continue to lead the industry and invest in our targeted growth engines. \\\"Reducing the workforce is not a decision we took lightly. But alongside other actions taken, we believe this is the right decision in order to drive the company into the future and best support our customers and partners around the world.\\\"",

Momentis, formerly Memic, which develops robotic-assisted surgery solutions, is laying off 70 of 120 employees  Israeli surgical robotics company Momentis, formerly Memic, is laying off 60% of its employees. Following the layoffs, only 50 employees will remain at the company, which until recently had 120 employees. Around 40 of the remaining employees are based in Israel, with the rest headquartered in the U.S. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Momentis, which develops robotic-assisted surgery solutions, announced in August 2021 that it reached an agreement to merge with MedTech Acquisition Corporation, a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) focused on medical technology. The combined company was set to have an estimated pro-forma equity value of more than $1 billion. However, the SPAC was ultimately canceled in March of last year due to market conditions and a few months later the Israeli company rebranded as Momentis. Momentis, which has raised $116 million to date, was founded in 2012 by Dvir Cohen and Peregrine Ventures, and initially operated in the Peregrine-run Incentive Incubator. Momentis has an R&D center in Or Yehuda and an engineering center in Acre where the robots are manufactured. Memic has set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in Fort Lauderdale, Florida which is in charge of global customer services, professional education, sales, marketing, and clinical research. The company’s first FDA approval was for use in single-site, natural orifice laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal benign surgical procedures including benign hysterectomies. \\\"The company made progress in launching its gynecological product in accordance with the plans and proved its clinical and economic value, which can be seen in the fact that leading hospitals in the U.S. are repeat customers of the company,” said Cohen. “The system has been getting better and better thanks to feedback from the field following close work with the customers and leading doctors. As a result, the performance specifications of the system, planned for reaching the market in 2025, have already been achieved, thus creating an opportunity for us to reach the main market of general surgery about two years before the planned time. Therefore, the company decided to focus on bringing to market a platform that serves a wide patient audience, both in gynecology and general surgery, and in order to promote market entry, we are currently focusing on regulatory efforts to obtain FDA approval for a product for general surgery in the coming year. “Due to the need to focus on the regulatory efforts, we have made the necessary business decision, with the broad support of the board of directors and all shareholders, to suspend production, marketing and sales efforts in the coming year. Therefore with great regret we say goodbye to approximately 70 out of the company's 120 employees, with the aim of slowing down the cash burn rate and to reach the market under optimal conditions at the beginning of 2024. This is a difficult day for me and it pains me to say goodbye to wonderful and dedicated employees who have come a long, long way with me.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Offensive cyber company QuaDream shutting down amidst spyware accusations. It was reported last week that the Israeli firm's hacking tools have been used against journalists, opposition figures and advocacy organizations across at least 10 countries Israeli offensive cyber company QuaDream is shutting down, Calcalist has learned. According to sources, all of the company’s employees were notified they are set to be laid off and called in for a hearing. The company is set to cease its operations in the coming days. The company could not be reached for comment. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Last week, it was reported that the Israeli firm's hacking tools have been used against journalists, opposition figures and advocacy organizations across at least 10 countries - including people in North America and Europe - according to new research published by Microsoft and the internet watchdog Citizen Lab. According to sources, the company has been in a difficult situation for several months, and the research was the last nail in its coffin. The company hasn't been fully active for a while and it is believed that there are only two employees left in its offices whose job it is to look after the computers and other equipment. At the same time, the board of directors is trying to sell the company's intellectual property. Citizen Lab said in its report that it had been able to identify a handful of civil society victims whose iPhones had been hacked using surveillance software developed by QuaDream - a lower-profile competitor to the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which has been blacklisted by the U.S. government over allegations of abuse. In its report published at the same time, Microsoft said it believed with \\\"high confidence\\\" that the spyware was \\\"strongly linked to QuaDream.\\\" In a statement, Microsoft Associate General Counsel Amy Hogan-Burney said that mercenary hacking groups like QuaDream \\\"thrive in the shadows\\\" and that publicly outing them was \\\"essential to stopping this activity.\\\" Israeli lawyer Vibeke Dank, whose email was listed on QuaDream's corporate registration form, did not return a message seeking comment. Repeated attempts by Reuters to reach QuaDream over the past year - including a visit to the company’s office outside Tel Aviv - have been unsuccessful. Reuters reported in 2022 that QuaDream had previously developed a no-interaction-needed hacking tool similar to the programs deployed by NSO. Such hacking tools, known as \\\"zero-click,\\\" are particularly prized by cybercriminals, spies, and law enforcement because they can remotely compromise devices without an owner needing to open a malicious link or download a tainted attachment. NSO did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Neither Citizen Lab nor Microsoft identified the targets of QuaDream's software, but the allegation could still be damaging for the firm. The reports come on the heels of an announced crackdown on the international spyware industry by U.S. President Joe Biden. Last month, the White House announced an executive order intended to curb the purchase of surveillance software by U.S. agencies if the programs are also being used by repressive governments abroad. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Unlike NSO, which regularly briefed journalists amid allegations of abuse, QuaDream has kept a lower profile. The company has no website touting its business and employees have been told to keep any reference to their employer off social media, Reuters has previously reported. Reuters contributed to this report",

The company laid off 15 employees three months ago, but ultimately decided it required far more significant cutbacks Conversation analytics company Gong is laying off 80 employees, accounting for 7% of its workforce. Only five of the employees leaving the company in this round of layoffs are based in Israel. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Amit Bendov, CEO of Gong, told Calcalist that he estimates that the company will not need to lay off any more employees this year. “The company is growing, but less than we forecast last year. The macroeconomic conditions are still difficult and we are adapting ourselves to our expected income,” said Bendov. “The employees being laid off are mainly part of our support and administration teams and aren’t part of the company’s core R&D. “I estimate that we will not lay off any more employees this year, even though there is currently a lack of clarity. We are looking ahead and we are experiencing a nice quarter with new clients joining, but the growth is still not as we predicted and will be slower than expected.” Gong raised a $250 million Series E funding round led by Franklin Templeton at a valuation of $7.25 billion in June 2021.

It’s the hardest decision I’ve had to make at Gong. The Gongsters we’re saying goodbye to are not just colleagues, they are friends. We are helping those impacted by providing comprehensive severance packages and resources to help them during the transition. “I’m sure your first question is why? The short answer is that while we expect to grow this year and we continue to see healthy new customer adds, our growth will be at a lower rate than we have planned for and have hired for in recent years. We need to adjust the size of our team to reflect our actual anticipated growth. This is a difficult decision and we did not rush into it. We took a “wait and see” approach for the possibility that we might not need to. It is hard to predict the market in the upcoming year, but our planning assumption is that the macro environment will continue to impact our customers, partners, and us. As a consequence, we need to reduce the size of our team in certain areas.”",

The company had raised a total of $5 million and employed around 20 people before being hit hard by the economic downturn “It is with a heavy heart that I must share the news that we had to close our doors due to a lack of funding,” wrote TenureX CEO and co-founder Izhar Arieli on LinkedIn, announcing the closure of his startup to the public. \\\"This was a difficult decision and one that weighed heavily on me for some time. We have struggled to bring new investment for the past seven months, laying off great people every month, not taking a salary, and trying to respond to the rapid changes in the macro environment and in the investor risk appetite. Although we found PMF and had a working product, a great team, and clients, we didn't make it through.\\\" Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 TenureX, founded in 2020, developed a platform that enabled and streamlined correspondent banking relationships, aiming to democratize correspondent banking. The company raised a total of $5 million, including from FINTOP Capital and VentureIsrael. Arieli told Calcalist that the company peaked at 20 employees, but he was forced to conduct layoffs as time passed by and funding dried up. “We embarked on a funding round in May with the aim of raising $15 million, but I very quickly understood that it wasn’t possible and tried again for a significantly lower sum. However, it became apparent that many of the investors with which I was in touch when I started off were no longer active.” In his LinkedIn post titled: “Sharing the Importance of Embracing Failure in Entrepreneurship”, Arieli wrote about the importance of encouraging other founders to be open about their struggles and failures and break down the stigma surrounding failure in the entrepreneurial world. “I have seen many peers who, like myself, have experienced the struggles of running a startup. However, they do not want to share their failures with others, fearing that they will reflect poorly on them or tarnish their reputation. This is a common mindset, but it is also one that is misguided. Failure is a part of the entrepreneurial journey, and it is something that we must embrace as we move forward. “Being an entrepreneur is one of the hardest and most consuming jobs in the world. It requires us to face the unknown every minute of our lives and to strive for success constantly. This pursuit of success, however, can often come at a cost, both emotionally and mentally. It's important for other founders to see that they're not alone in their struggles and that even the most promising startups can face challenges and also close operations. “To all of you who are struggling right now, remember that It is okay to fail the emotional burden that comes with it is something that we must all face at some point in our careers.

The fintech company laid off 20 of its 80 team members after parting with a similar number of employees last March Fintech startup Lightico, which provides companies and organizations mobile e-signature and e-document solutions, has embarked on a second round of layoffs, firing 20 employees, accounting for 25% of its workforce. The company parted with 20 employees in the first round of layoffs in March of last year. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 “We were the first to lay off employees in 2022 and this helped us reach the end of the year,” CEO Zviki Ben Ishay told Calcalist. “Now we see that the situation is not improving and we must reach a path to profitability. We must control our own destiny and when the market recovers we can once again raise funds and recruit employees. “We aren’t feeling any slowdown in business in our sector, but in order to grow I have to burn money because our marketing costs are very high,” added Ben Ishay. “I don't want to spend all of our cash and find ourselves in a cash crunch. This is a company that is built great and there were no unnecessary employees, but this is the market at the moment. We said goodbye to amazing people and we will help them all.” Lightico raised $14 million in a follow-on Series B funding round led by Capital One Ventures in July 2021, bringing the total round to $27 million. Joining the round were Hapoalim Bank, which also integrated Lightico’s services into its operations, and previous investors lool Ventures, Crescendo Venture Partners, and Mangrove Capital Partners. Lightico’s digital completion platform is used by major companies in the insurance, automotive, telecom, and financial industries. It allows companies to collect documents, verify identification and accept payments from customers’ smartphones. Lightico was founded in 2015 by CEO Zviki Ben-Ishay, COO Omri Braun and CTO Justin Josh.",

The company peaked at a valuation of around $20 billion, becoming Israel’s highest-valued company for a short time, only to suffer a painful fall back down to Earth.

The software company, which went public on Nasdaq at a $2.5 billion valuation in June 2021, said it is cutting jobs as part of its strategic focus on enterprises Software company WalkMe is laying off 3% of its workforce, accounting for 43 employees.

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 WalkMe went public on Nasdaq at a $2.5 billion valuation in June 2021, raising $286 million. The company currently has a market cap of around $830 million. It still has over $320 million in cash in its accounts but decided to cut its team in order to reduce its cash burn rate in the hope of becoming profitable in 2023. The cutback program is expected to save WalkMe around $6-7 million a year. WalkMe was founded in 2011 by Rafael Sweary and Dan Adika. The company also announced that Sweary will be taking a step back and no longer serve as president of the company and will only remain a board member and and advisor to Adika. In addition, Adika will continue to serve as CEO, but will no longer also hold the role of chairperson, a role which has now been given to Michele Bettencourt. WalkMe has developed a platform for adopting digital technologies without the need to write additional code. The concept behind WalkMe’s solution is to help organizations measure, promote and act in order to maximize the impact of digital transformation processes, thereby improving the efficiency of the software the organization uses. WalkMe's products are used by both the companies' employees and their clients. “Out of responsibility, due to the situation in the market and in order to maintain a positive cash flow situation, the company decided to strategically focus on its enterprise clients, who will receive the best value from the Digital Adoption Platform,” the company said in a statement. “As part of this move, alongside recruiting for roles that support the company’s business focus, 43 roles that aren’t such will be cut from the global workforce, including six in Israel. This is a difficult but necessary decision. The company is sadly parting ways with wonderful people and is thankful for their contributions to its development and growth.”",

However, this is something that must be done and it is better to do it from a position of strength when we have money in the bank and strong clients.” Potekhin said the company has been working on the process for several months and made sure to do it in a way that would include just one round of layoffs. CyCognito, founded in 2017 by former Israeli intelligence unit soldiers Rob Gurzeev and Potekhin, raised a $100 million Series C funding round at an $800 million valuation last December. The round was led by The Westly Group and included Thomvest Ventures, The Heritage Group, Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sorenson Ventures, and UpWest. That new financing round brought the company’s total amount raised to $153 million, all raised in just the three-and-a-half years since the company was founded. The CyCognito platform autonomously builds a graph data model that portrays an organization’s business structure—from the company’s name to the hundreds of departments, subsidiaries, acquisitions, and brands an organization owns. The platform then scans billions of servers and devices across the internet to contextualize and identify internet-exposed and unmanaged assets that could serve as entry points for attackers.",

The Israeli company, which raised $300 million at a $3.4 billion valuation one year ago, will be parting with 3.5% of its team Cybersecurity unicorn Armis Security is laying off 25 employees. Armis, which employs 670 people in total, is one of the most successful cyber companies in Israel, being acquired by New York-based venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners and Google’s investment fund Capital G for $1.1 billion in January 2020. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022 Armis raised $300 million at a $3.4 billion valuation in November 2021, taking its total funding to $600 million. The round was led by One Equity Partners, in conjunction with existing investors. “Armis is continuing to grow and experience strong demand for its products and will again double its revenue this year,” the company said in a statement. “Due to adjustments to its work plan and the shifting of budgets between departments, we have decided to make some changes in human resources that included the movement of employees between positions at the company and a streamlining process in which we made the difficult decision to part ways with 25 of our 670 employees - around 3.5% of the workforce at the company. We are doing this in order to prepare for a possibility of a future slowdown and in order to continue and build a leading global cybersecurity company for the long run.” Armis was founded in 2015 by CEO Yevgeny Dibrov and CTO Nadir Izrael, who remain at the helm of the company. Armis has developed an agentless, enterprise-class device security platform designed to address the threat landscape of unmanaged IoT devices. \\\"This is a difficult day for us,\\\" the company co-founders told Calcalist. \\\"When there is such a powerful anomaly in the market and a change in the way companies are measured, even a strong company like Armis is affected by this. What we are seeing in the market are signs of recession, so even though we are growing like crazy, we need to be a lot more responsible. We are still looking into making acquisitions and what we are doing now is a small correction on our way to going public. We want to be in control of our destiny and are acting according to the most pessimistic assumptions in the market, even though cyber budgets are increasing. We are focusing on very large organizations and are seeing very nice growth there. We are approaching 2023 in the most conservative way despite the strong demand.\\\"",

The company, which has developed a platform to manage media assets, has been bootstrapped since it was founded and announced a secondary investment of $110 million at a company valuation of $2 billion earlier this year Israeli unicorn Cloudinary, which has developed a platform to manage media assets, is laying off 8% of its workforce, amounting to a total of around 40 employees. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022 Earlier this year, the company, which has never raised any funds for the company coffers since it was founded in 2012, announced a secondary investment from funds managed by Blackstone Growth (BXG) reaching a sum of $110 million at a company valuation of $2 billion. Blackstone’s investment follows three previous secondary rounds, by Salesforce Ventures in 2020 and Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP) in 2018 and 2015. Just six months ago, Cloudinary announced plans to set up a new center in Israel and recruit dozens of new employees. “Due to our fast growth over recent years we have recently implemented a process to make our structure more precise, as well as the way we operate, which focuses on creating maximum value for the clients of each of our different products,” the company said. “As a result of this process, we have recently parted ways with 40 of our employees, which amounts to 8% of our workforce from across the world (U.S., UK, Poland, and Israel). “This process comes after growth of 30% in the Cloudinary workforce in the first half of 2022 and after fast growth in 2021 which also included the company acquiring another company for the first time, as well as the launching of new products and reaching $100 million in ARR. Cloudinary has been bootstrapped from day one until now, meaning it continues to maintain its financial independence by relying on the company’s income without any external funding. “Saying goodbye to people isn’t simple - first and foremost for those leaving. These are good and talented people. In order to help and make it a little bit easier on them, we have created a program which includes additional pay as well as our help in finding their next job and support with personal career advice.” Cloudinary was founded in 2012 by Itai Lahan (CEO), Nadav Soferman (CPO), and Tal Lev-Ami (CTO). The company says it has more than 50 billion assets under management and nearly 10,000 customers worldwide, including brands like Atlassian, Bleacher Report, Bombas, Grubhub, Hinge, NBC, Mediavine, Minted, Peloton, and Petco.",

Half of those being laid off are employed in the company’s R&D center in Israel. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022 Varonis employed 2,270 people prior to the layoffs, including 550 that were hired over the past two years. The company reported just last week that it expects revenue of $470 million for the year, and that as of the end of September 30, it had $790.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Nevertheless, it made the decision to cut its staff, with its share price plummeting by more than a third after its disappointing results for the third quarter were published last week, seeing its market cap fall to $1.76 billion. The layoffs in Varonis come on the back of cutbacks at fellow local cybersecurity powerhouses Snyk and Cybereason. However, Varonis is the only one of those companies that is publicly traded, with the likes of fellow publicly-traded companies Check Point, CyberArk, and Palo Alto Networks still recruiting employees. Varonis, which develops a security software platform for enterprises, said last week that it is expecting revenues of $139-142 million, or year-over-year growth of 10% to 12%, in the fourth quarter, well below the expectation for growth of 20%. Varonis is still not profitable, registering a GAAP operating loss of $25.6 million in the third quarter compared to a loss of $18.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. The company said it was adjusting its previous full-year outlook to reflect “near-term headwinds from macroeconomic uncertainty and continued foreign currency weakness.” It also noted that it was affected by its exit from the Russian market due to the war in Ukraine.",

However, it is a necessary step to strengthen our business fundamentals so that we can execute on our mission to help small business owners with their financial needs. “Here is some context around the decision. Fundbox serves small businesses through working capital and cash flow solutions, both directly and through our partners. As macroeconomic trends continue to impact the small business economy, we too face material business headwinds. It is clear that these economic challenges will last for longer than we initially expected,” Fuloria added. “Moreover, our business grew quickly over the last two years, and we scaled our team accordingly. We brought on colleagues who have contributed enormously to our progress. But the truth is that we grew our team too fast, and we need to course correct. While we are well capitalized with over $100M in liquidity, we also need to be careful stewards of investor capital. Bringing our workforce back to our pre-pandemic size will strengthen our financial footing as we work towards becoming a profitable business, which we are not today.”",

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022 Vee raised $12 million in a Seed round in February of this year led by State of Mind Ventures, with participation from noted Israeli VCs Oryzn Capital, Vertex, Viola Ventures, and well-known angel investors including Eynat Guez of Papaya Global, Amir Shevat of Innovation Endeavors, Gil Hirsch of StreamElements, and Guy Shamir of Mivtach Shamir. Founded in 2020 by 23-year-old entrepreneur May Piamenta (CEO), Gil Amsalem (CTO), and Avi Amor (COO), Vee has raised a total of $13.5 million to date. Its platform hosts a wide range of volunteering opportunities such as food aid, animal welfare, youth mentoring, and environmental initiatives, enabling HR teams to find, coordinate, and share charity events and in effect build a community for giving back inside the company. Piamenta confirmed the cutbacks to Calcalist, but insisted that the company has no plans of shutting down. “The company isn’t going anywhere. We serve thousands of non-profit initiatives and we will continue to focus on them and our existing clients.”",

        "Extracted Article": "Otonomo to lay off dozens of employees after losing over 90% of value. Just a year after it went public via a SPAC merger at a value of $1.26 billion, Israeli autotech company Otonomo has seen its market cap plummet to a mere $62 million Israeli autotech company Otonomo is expected to lay off dozens of employees, Calcalist has learned. The company, which built a marketplace for the trading of information coming from connected vehicles and went public a year ago on Nasdaq, employs close to 200 people - more than half of them at its R&D center in Herzliya. Otonomo, which was issued during the wave of IPOs of companies in the autonomous vehicle sector alongside REE and Innoviz, is on its way to the title of \\\"the worst Israeli IPO of 2021\\\", after its stock plunged from a value of $1.26 billion in the IPO to only $62 million last Friday. The company even announced on the same day that it received a non-compliance letter from Nasdaq regarding the possible delisting of its shares, after its stock traded below the price of a dollar for more than 30 days. Regarding the expected extensive cutbacks, Otonomo told Calcalist that the company does not respond to rumors. Although Otonomo's stock is not the only one that was almost completely erased this year and is under the threat of being delisted, in its case the business results are also noticeably negative. Otonomo is very far from the forecasts it gave at the time of the merger with the SPAC company, both regarding revenues and profitability. Moreover, with the publication of the financial reports for the second quarter about a week ago, it even informed investors that the forecast for 2022 given in the past is not valid, and also that it will not provide a forecast for the second half of the year at all. “As we look to the second half of the year, we realize we can be susceptible to macro-economic headwinds, which can affect our 2022 guidance. Based on the global uncertainties in the market, the forecast for 2022 should no longer be relied upon and we are not forecasting results for the second half of the year at this time,” Otonomo CEO Ben Volkow stated last week. “We believe these are near-term challenges and we will remain focused on scaling our business and growing our customer base,” Volkow concluded and provided another justification for the planned layoffs and the fact that his company is trading well below the value of the cash in its coffers. Otonomo was established in 2015 by Volkow and Avner Cohen, who is not active in the company. The company developed a trading arena for information collected from connected vehicles and serves car manufacturers, vehicle fleets and more than 100 service providers in various industries such as insurance and public transportation. According to the company's data, its platform securely processes more than 4 billion items of information every day, which are collected from more than 40 million connected vehicles (those with a SIM card) around the world. In its SPAC merger a year ago, the company raised $255 million, of which only $169 million still remain in its account. At the same time, Otonomo shareholders also sold $30 million worth of shares based on impressive excel sheets according to which the company was supposed to reach annual revenues of $24 million in 2022 and a gross profit of $4 million. Next year, Otonomo was already supposed to register revenues of $98 million and be operationally balanced, but even Volkow himself admitted in the conference call with analysts that \\\"we may have been a little too optimistic in our forecasts and expectations for growth based on a rapid increase in the volume of connected vehicles.\\\" In the meantime, it seems that the connection between Otonomo’s connected car and reality has been lost, and in the second quarter it recorded revenues of only $1.9 million. Although this is apparently a sharp jump compared to revenues of only $281,000 in the corresponding quarter, the growth came with two companies that Otonomo bought for generous sums since the IPO. The acquisitions also inflated the workforce, which amounted to 128 employees at the end of 2021. The first company acquired was the Israeli startup Neura, for which $50 million was paid in shares and cash, and the second was Floow, which was purchased for $69 million - half in an immediate payment of cash and shares and half subject to meeting targets. The two acquired companies together employed about 60 people. The purchase of Floow, which operates in the insurance sector, is the main contributor to Otonomo's revenues today, since last year it had revenues of approximately $7 million - that is, significantly more than Otonomo itself. Although in the first quarter they were consolidated only for part of the period and not a full quarter, it is easy to see that at least a million dollars should have come from Floow. Neura, whose solution is supposed to enable the extraction of insights from the information collected through Otonomo's platform, is a younger company, but at the time of the acquisition it was said that it too already had revenues of a few million dollars a year. Beyond the great distance between the performance and forecasts, another surprise awaited Otonomo investors in the form of a write-off of $45 million. This write-off was mainly due to the decrease in the value of Otonomo itself, but also included the write-off of in the value of the acquired companies which seem very expensive in light of Otonomo's current value. The write-off sent Otonomo to an operating loss of $65 million, which certainly will not please the company's largest shareholders - the Saudi investment fund MITACH, which recently reported that it had reached a 20% stake in Otonomo. It seems that at this stage it is better for both Otonomo’s management and its shareholders to return the company to private ownership, put it in order after the two acquisitions, and hold off on an IPO for a more reasonable time - without SPAC shortcuts and after it begins to show clearer signs of the realization of its vision.",

Reali raised a $100 million Series B led by Zeev Ventures with participation from Akkadian Ventures, Signia Ventures, and others, just one year ago. The real estate and fintech company also announced at that time that it is raising another $75 million in equity and $25 million in venture debt. That round took Reali's total funding to $140 million, with Oren Zeev's Zeev Ventures also leading previous rounds. Among the company's other investors are the likes of legendary NFL player Joe Montana, who invested in Reali through his Liquid2 fund, and Dovi Frances. Reali was founded in 2015 by Ami Avrahami and Amit Heller. Avrahami and Heller are also behind proptech company Veev. At its peak in 2020, Reali employed as many as 40 people in Israel.

The much-maligned offensive cyber company will be parting ways with around 15% of its workforce, while long-standing CEO Hulio will focus on the sale of the company, which has been under intense scrutiny since last year for the sale of its Pegasus hacking tool Offensive cyber company NSO is laying off 100 of its 700 employees, Calcalist has learned. In addition, co-founder and CEO Shalev Hulio will be stepping down from his role and will be replaced by current COO Yaron Shohat. Hulio will remain in the company and be in charge of mergers and acquisitions. As part of this new role, Hulio will be responsible for helping the company find a new owner. As the new CEO, Shohat is in charge of implementing the company’s reorganization process, including the layoffs. NSO has been under especially intense scrutiny since last year. Apple filed a lawsuit against NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for alleged surveillance and targeting of the U.S. in November of last year. Apple was the latest in a string of companies and governments to come after NSO, the maker of the Pegasus hacking tool that watchdog groups say targeted human rights workers and journalists. Earlier that month, U.S. officials placed the company on a trade blacklist. NSO has also faced either legal action or criticism from Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Cisco. NSO is allegedly involved in circumventing security for products made by these companies and selling that circumvention in the form of hacking tools to foreign governments. NSO told Calcalist: “The company will be implementing a cutback and reorganization program in order to adjust itself to the challenges ahead. As part of this, 100 employees will be laid off, and Shalev Hulio will step down from his role as CEO to continue and focus on mergers and the sale of the company. Yaron Shohat, who has filled several executive roles at the company over the past four years, will lead the company and its cutback and reorganization process.” Sources close to the company told Calcalist that the Ministry of Defense’s decision to reduce the number of licenses for the sale of offensive cyber tools has already led some companies to bankruptcy and that others will also go bust should this policy not change. Despite recent rumors that NSO is on the verge of bankruptcy, Calcalist has learned that it will end 2022 with revenue of around $150 million. Earlier this month, an inspection team headed by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari published a report verifying the core findings revealed by Calcalist earlier this year in regard to the police's use of spyware and offensive cyber tools developed by NSO and other companies against citizens.",

A total of 14 employees have left the company since it announced a $10 million Series A five months ago, with some leaving as their roles become redundant due to the company’s decision to reorganize its business activity. CEO and Co-founder of anywell, Gadi Royz, told Calcalist that the company assisted those who were laid off to find new jobs and provided them with generous support packages. Its Series A in March was led by Pitango and Viola Ventures with other participants including Emerge. Anywell, founded by Gadi Royz, Ori Naishtein, Erez Tadmor, and Tomer Sharon, helps companies transition to a hybrid work model by enabling employees to work from spaces in their local communities.

This will be the second significant cost cut by the company since it announced its intention to reduce expenses earlier this year, with Wix parting with several dozen employees when it closed its subsidiary Wix Answers in June Israeli-founded website building company Wix.com is laying off 100 employees, most of whom are based abroad. The company, which employs around 6,000 people, will publish its results for the second quarter of the year on Wednesday. Wix didn’t respond to the report. This will be the second significant cost cut by the company since it announced its intention to reduce expenses earlier this year. In June, the company laid off several dozen employees when it closed its subsidiary Wix Answers. Wix, which has built a platform for setting up websites and online stores, surprised investors when it first talked about focusing on the spending side and setting profitability targets when it announced its result for the first quarter of 2022. \\\"Volatility and uncertainty remain at high levels and this creates a difficult environment for revenue growth. We are focused on strict cost management that will lead to operational efficiency, and we are already beginning to see results in the field,\\\" Lior Shemesh, CFO of Wix, was quoted as saying in the company’s first-quarter financial reports. At that stage, the company was not ready to specify what exactly the plan will include, but Nir Zohar, President of Wix, insisted in a conversation with Calcalist that a round of layoffs was not planned, but rather more minor cuts and especially a reduction in investment in marketing. \\\"Since the beginning of the year, the world has experienced an economic crisis and we have seen U.S. GDP fall without growth,\\\" says Zohar. \\\"It affects our business because the internet is not growing and we can not remain indifferent to it in the short term, even if we are confident that the long-term trends will continue. If there is less traffic on the internet, Wix will spend less on marketing. At a time like this, we want to be more calculated. We will increase the number of employees in the coming year, but it will be in the tens or hundreds. Of course, we will not double the workforce as we have done in the last three years.” The Q1 results published by Wix revealed a not particularly encouraging picture of significant slowdown in growth, along with huge losses. These reports came after the fiasco of the annual reports for 2021, in which Wix did not provide an annual forecast for 2022 and attributed this to a high level of uncertainty. In the meantime, however, the macroeconomic environment has only become more complex, and although this time the company is making a forward forecast, it is talking about a growth rate that is significantly lower than what it has accustomed investors to. The company predicted annual growth of 10-13% in revenue, but warned that this is \\\"provided that no further deterioration is seen in the macro environment.” Alongside the growth rate that slowed dramatically after the pandemic period, the heavy losses that Wix is still recording are particularly noticeable. In the first quarter, it lost $227.3 million or $3.95 per share, with the loss including $116 million that stems largely from the fall in monday.com shares, which Wix holds. But even after deducting such losses, Wix posted a loss of $41.4 million in the first quarter and burned $33.6 million.",

Vee’s platform hosts a wide range of volunteering opportunities, enabling HR teams to find, coordinate, and share charity events Israeli startup Vee, which is developing a volunteering platform, is laying off 16 of its 50 employees, making up around 30% of its workforce. Vee raised $12 million in a Seed round less than six months ago led by State of Mind Ventures, with participation from noted Israeli VCs Oryzn Capital, Vertex, Viola Ventures, and well-known angel investors including Eynat Guez of Papaya Global, Amir Shevat of Innovation Endeavors, Gil Hirsch of StreamElements, and Guy Shamir of Mivtach Shamir. “As some of you already heard, we decided to let go of 30% of our employees,” CEO May Piamenta wrote in a LinkedIn post on Sunday. “We made this decision with an extremely heavy heart, knowing we are committed firstly to Vee, to our investors, and to all the people around the world who get help from our platform. “Before blaming the market or anyone else, I want to take full responsibility for this incredibly unfair, hard moment for our team. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you are hiring you will all benefit greatly from working with those talented, mission-driven individuals,” concluded Piamenta. Founded in 2020 by 23-year-old entrepreneur May Piamenta (CEO), Gil Amsalem (CTO), and Avi Amor (COO), Vee has raised a total of $13.5 million to date. Its platform hosts a wide range of volunteering opportunities such as food aid, animal welfare, youth mentoring, and environmental initiatives, enabling HR teams to easily find, coordinate, and share charity events and in effect build a community for giving back inside the company. “I set up my first business in eighth grade, purchasing swimwear and then selling it on. I sent out deliveries throughout the entire country, with the operation being run out of my home in Dimona,” Piamenta told Calcalist in February of this year. “I sold the company at the end of eighth grade and joined a robotics program. I realized that I connect with the entrepreneurial part of the group and that led me to raise funds for the program. During this program, I encountered many non-profit organizations that require help and many companies that want to help but don’t know how. Towards the end of my IDF service, I understood that I wanted my next business to tackle this challenge, but I didn’t have enough money to start. So instead I set up a company that helped build websites for people and companies within 24 hours. After six months we managed to raise funds for the new company so I brought in my cousin Gil Amsalem and we recruited our third partner Avi, as well as a development team that volunteered to work on the project.” Vee has over 500 companies and organizations on its platform, among them eBay, Booking.com, Salesforce, and Columbia University. The platform is active in 10 different countries and logs in hundreds of new activities per week.",

All 120 employees of Soluto were notified on Sunday of Asurion’s decision. The move was made as part of an internal reorganization at Asurion which includes downsizing its global workforce and changing its business focus and growth targets. Asurion will also be parting ways with hundreds of employees from its U.S. offices. Asurion said that it made the difficult decision to close its Israeli site as a result of the cuts being made across the company and after choosing to focus its current growth on the cellular market. “This decision doesn’t allow us to continue and employ the talented employees at Soluto and to continue and develop the innovative technologies at the Tel Aviv site,” the company said. The company added that Soluto’s 120 employees will receive extended benefits in order to provide them with a safety net for the coming months. All employees will receive guidance and support from a professional team set up by the company’s HR department in order to help them find a new job. Around 40 people will continue to be employed at the company until the end of the year. “The decision to close the offices in Tel Aviv and part ways with the team that contributed to our company’s success over many years is not easy,” said John Leonard, Senior Vice President, Global Product Management, at Asurion. “The team at Soluto had an important part in our growth and success since the company was acquired in 2013.” Soluto CEO Merav Oren, who was appointed to the role last June, said: “We are very sad to announce that today we had to notify all of our team members at Soluto of Asurion’s decision to shut down the Israeli development center. These are people who believe in the company and the product and gave their heart and capabilities every day in order to create the best possible product for our users. We brought in the best professionals in their fields to Soluto over the years, creating a leading force in Israeli tech and maintaining a unique culture. For me personally, this is a very difficult moment. We are committed to making every effort to support and help each and every one of the employees to find an excellent workplace that will benefit from their capabilities and skills.” Tomer Dvir, co-founder of Soluto and SVP at Asurion, said: “I was very saddened by the decision. We set up a professional team with a unique culture that over 14 years created, and influenced the local community, Asurion, and millions of customers across the world. Despite the pain, I know that the team members will take with them the unique talent, culture, and attitude to the lucky companies which they will join next.” Soluto was founded in 2008 by Dvir and Ishay Green to provide a digital protection and support service that integrates an app, web portal, and support technicians. It raised a total of $18 million before being acquired by Asurion in 2013 for $130 million, marking its entrance to the Israeli operations market.",

The Israeli startup, which provides community insights and an analytics platform for state and local governments, will be parting ways with around 30 employees Zencity, a community insights and analytics platform for state and local governments, has laid off 30 employees, making up around 20% of its total workforce. Around 20 of the employees were based in Israel, with the rest being located in the company’s offices in North America. Zencity has raised over $50 million to date, including $30 million last June from TLV Partners, Vertex Ventures Israel, Salesforce Ventures, M12 - Microsoft’s venture fund, and Canaan Partners Israel. The company has grown rapidly over the past year, including completing two acquisitions of companies in the U.S. and Canada. Founded in 2015 by CEO Eyal Feder-Levy and CTO Ido Ivry, Zencity provides municipalities and other local authorities data-based insights enabling them to make better decisions with a deeper understanding of their resident’s needs. The company makes use of artificial intelligence to analyze data aggregated from resident-generated data from sources including social media, mobile applications, and city hotlines and create actionable insights for mayors, municipal department heads, and other decision-makers. The company serves around 300 clients, including four of the five biggest cities in the U.S., as well as the Israeli municipalities of Tel Aviv, Beer Sheba, Ramat Gan, and Netanya. “We are conducting an organizational change and are parting ways with truly excellent people,” said Feder-Levy. “This is very painful on a human level, but it is the responsible thing to do for the betterment of our clients and mission. We have built something extraordinary at Zencity over the past five years. We are a company that is growing rapidly and have also scaled significantly, and are effecting on a daily basis hundreds of cities across the world while increasing the trust between local municipalities and the residents they serve. Over the recent period our workforce has grown considerably under certain market assumptions that we took. The situation in the markets has changed and that requires us to act accordingly and I take responsibility for that. However, we need to remain first and foremost committed to our clients and to the residents they serve. Despite parting ways, our commitment to the employees continues to be deep and we will do everything we can to help them move to their next role easily and safely. I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone for their great contribution to our success and to the local municipalities we support.” The company noted that the organizational change will affect every part of the company, including management, and that it will set the company up for continued growth and global expansion after recently adding clients in the UK, Australia, and additional countries.",

The Israeli company will be parting ways with 30 employees eight months after raising $205 million at a $1.5 billion valuation Israeli unicorn Lusha is laying off 30 employees, 10% of its total workforce, across all departments. Lusha raised $205 million at a $1.5 billion valuation eight months ago, with a significant part of the round going towards secondary deals. The Series B last November came on the back of a $40 million Series A in February which followed five years of being bootstrapped. Lusha was founded in 2016 by Assaf Eisenstein and Yoni Tserruya. In May of this year, Plus Ventures, headed by veteran entrepreneur Yossi Moldawsky, and private investor Oren Abekasis, filed a lawsuit with the Tel Aviv District Court claiming that they invested in the previous reincarnation of Lusha, when the company was named Neta Eisenstein Management (2008) and that the founders of Lusha stole the company from its investors. Lusha’s cloud-based platform facilitates salespeople sharing contact information and company insights, which validates Lusha’s data and ensures high accuracy. The company's community approach also ensures that salespeople from organizations of all sizes have access to the data they need to optimize their sales outreach. “Lusha has grown rapidly in revenue and manpower over the past year. Nevertheless, due to the situation in the markets and the economic slowdown, we have made a difficult decision to take responsible steps that will ensure the continued success of Lusha over time and provide control over cash flow,” the company said. “As part of the reorganization for the new situation, we will focus the company on the data sector and other strategic projects, while stopping over projects and becoming more efficient in our marketing and sales expenses in order to continue and grow. As a result, we are sadly forced to part ways with talented employees who we’ll provide with an expanded departure package and support in finding a new job in order to ensure a soft as possible landing.”",

The trading platform is currently in advanced negotiations for a private funding round for between $800 million and $1 billion, at a $5 billion valuation Trading platform eToro is laying off 100 employees, half of them in Israel. This number represents around 6% of the company’s total workforce. At the same time as announcing the cuts, eToro also officially announced that it mutually agreed with the Betsy Cohen-backed blank-check company FinTech Acquisition Corp to terminate their SPAC merger deal more than a year after it was announced. The companies announced back in March of 2021 that they had agreed to merge at a company valuation of $10.3 billion. However, the deal was bogged down by a protracted prospectus and regulatory process. FinTech Acquisition Corp V then announced in January that the fintech company’s valuation has been cut by over 15% to $8.8 billion. In addition, the size of the funding it was set to receive fell from $650 million to $443 million, meaning it became even clearer that eToro would be better off raising funds privately, even at the expense of shareholders being diluted, rather than going public. As a result, eToro is currently in advanced negotiations for a private funding round for between $800 million and $1 billion, at a $5 billion valuation. The failure to complete the merger wasn’t just due to the dramatic drop in the valuations of tech companies, but was also the result of regulatory changes in regard to SPACs and companies involved in cryptocurrencies, which accounted for a large portion of eToro’s growth over recent years. “Due to the current market conditions and after a period of accelerated growth we decided to take in the current period a more balanced approach between growth and profitability,” said eToro CEO and co-founder Yoni Assia. “As a result, we made a difficult decision to cut our workforce in order to ensure long-term sustainable growth.”",

Most of the total of around 80 layoffs will be of employees in the U.S., with 30 employees from Israel leaving the company Israeli unicorn Verbit, which has developed an AI-powered real-time transcription and captioning platform, is undergoing an organizational change that will see it reduce the company’s workforce by 10% in order to accelerate its path to profitability. Most of the total of around 80 layoffs will be of employees in the U.S., with 30 employees from Israel to also leave the company. Verbit closed a $250 million Series E at a $2 billion valuation in November of last year. “We need to act and prepare ourselves to be in the best position to continue to grow and prosper,” said Verbit CEO and founder Tom Livne. Verbit joins a growing list of unicorns to layoff employees over recent weeks, including eToro, Lightricks, Cybereason, OpenWeb, and Trax. Verbit also notified its employees that it will be restructuring the company into business divisions after reaching an ARR of $100 million. This structure will allow it to reduce redundant positions created due to the company’s acquisitions and put it in a position to continue its growth with additional acquisitions. Verbit, which also raised $157 million in a Series C last May, has developed an AI platform that offers advanced technologies and full integrations into video-focused platforms. “We have experienced a period of hypergrowth, increasing our workforce fivefold over a period of 18 months during which we acquired six companies,” Livne wrote in a letter to the company’s employees. “Our success, which includes the doubling of our client base, including strategic clients in the different industries we serve, was achieved in different market conditions, and now we need to navigate the company and ensure that we are in the best position to lead it to prosperity and continued success, while we balance between growth and profitability.” In order to help the company in its organizational change, Alon Klomek, the former Chief Business Officer at Cellebrite, has been brought in as a VP. “It is always sad to part ways with significant partners in our journey and I want to thank each and every one of the Verbit employees that took part in this journey and made the company a world leader in its sector. Myself and the rest of the Verbit management are personally committed to helping each and every one find the next destination in their career.” Verbit, which was founded in 2017 and has offices in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Israel, will employ a total of 520 employees following the cutback, 50 more than it had when it announced its latest funding round.",

The American-Israeli company is parting ways with around 150 employees as it continues to look for a way out of a crisis that saw it pause all withdrawals from its platform three weeks ago Cryptocurrency platform Celsius has laid off 150 employees, including in Israel, Calcalist has learned. The crypto lender announced on June 13 that it was pausing withdrawals citing \\\"extreme market conditions,\\\" raising concerns about its solvency. The American-Israeli company has since hired restructuring consultants and lawyers to make organizational changes to the company amid its financial issues. “We are focused and working as quickly as we can to stabilize liquidity and operations, in order to be positioned to share more information with the community,” Celsius wrote on its blog on Friday. “We are operating with the entire community and all clients in mind as we work through these challenging times.” The company added: “We continue to take important steps to preserve and protect assets and explore options available to us. These options include pursuing strategic transactions as well as a restructuring of our liabilities, among other avenues. These exhaustive explorations are complex and take time, but we want the community to know that our teams are working with experts from many different disciplines. Our relationship with the community and our clients has been a source of pride for all team members at Celsius, and we will continue to share information with our customers as and when it becomes appropriate.” Celsius was co-founded in 2017 by Israeli Daniel Leon, President and COO of Celsius, CEO Alex Mashinsky, and CTO Nuke Goldstein. The company, which raised $750 million in funding late last year, reaching a valuation of $3 billion, offered interest-bearing products to customers who deposit their cryptocurrencies with the company, and lends out cryptocurrencies to earn a return. As of May 17, the company had processed $8.2 billion worth of loans and had $11.8 billion in assets, according to its website. Celsius did not respond to Calcalist’s request for comment.",

The fintech company laid off 20 of its 80 team members after parting with a similar number of employees last March Fintech startup Lightico, which provides companies and organizations mobile e-signature and e-document solutions, has embarked on a second round of layoffs, firing 20 employees, accounting for 25% of its workforce. The company parted with 20 employees in the first round of layoffs in March of last year. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 “We were the first to lay off employees in 2022 and this helped us reach the end of the year,” CEO Zviki Ben Ishay told Calcalist. “Now we see that the situation is not improving and we must reach a path to profitability. We must control our own destiny and when the market recovers we can once again raise funds and recruit employees. “We aren’t feeling any slowdown in business in our sector, but in order to grow I have to burn money because our marketing costs are very high,” added Ben Ishay. “I don't want to spend all of our cash and find ourselves in a cash crunch. This is a company that is built great and there were no unnecessary employees, but this is the market at the moment. We said goodbye to amazing people and we will help them all.” Lightico raised $14 million in a follow-on Series B funding round led by Capital One Ventures in July 2021, bringing the total round to $27 million. Joining the round were Hapoalim Bank, which also integrated Lightico’s services into its operations, and previous investors lool Ventures, Crescendo Venture Partners, and Mangrove Capital Partners. Lightico’s digital completion platform is used by major companies in the insurance, automotive, telecom, and financial industries. It allows companies to collect documents, verify identification and accept payments from customers’ smartphones.

The job cuts follow a series of large headcount reductions across the tech industry. In January, Meta said it would let go of 5% of its workers, and earlier this month Workday , which sells human resources and finance software, announced an 8.5% decrease. Google this week also announced cuts to its human relations and cloud divisions, CNBC reported , and PC maker HP said in a Thursday regulatory filing that it would reduce its headcount by 1,000 or 2,000, representing under 4% of total headcount. \\\"Our GTM model has evolved significantly from the transition to subscription and multi-year contracts billed annually to self-service enablement, the adoption of direct billing, and more,\\\" Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost wrote in a memo to employees. \\\"These changes position us to better meet the evolving needs of our customers and channel partners. To fully benefit from these changes, we are beginning the transformation of our GTM organization to increase customer satisfaction and Autodesk's productivity.\\\" The company is also conducting the layoffs to stay competitive in the current economy and protect the company's leadership in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, Anagnost wrote. San Francisco-based Autodesk will make facility reductions as well. But it will not close any offices, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email. It expects $135 million to $150 million in restructuring costs before taxes. The company on Thursday also announced better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results . The company delivered $2.29 in adjusted earnings per share on $1.64 billion in revenue, which was up 12% year over year.

        "Extracted Article": "Google told staffers in its \\\"People Operations\\\" and cloud organizations this week that it plans to cut employees as part of internal reorganizations, CNBC has learned. The company will offer a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based, full-time employees in People Operations, Google's human relations division, starting in early March, according to a memo issued Tuesday by HR chief Fiona Cicconi that was viewed by CNBC. The latest cuts come after finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said one of her top priorities would be to drive more cost-cutting as Google expands its spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. After the company on Feb. 3 reported revenue that missed expectations for the fourth quarter , Ashkenazi said Google had strong demand for AI products and that it \\\"exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\\\" As part of the HR buyouts, employees who are level 4 and level 5 may receive a severance of 14 weeks of salary and one additional week for every full year of service, the memo says. Those are considered mid- to senior-level employees. Separately, the company also made cuts to several teams within its cloud unit, mostly affecting operations support staff, according to sources and separate internal memos. Some of those moves include moving roles to other countries. The company confirmed the changes to CNBC, saying reorganizations are part of the normal course of business. \\\"Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and ensure they are set up for long term success,\\\" Google spokesperson Brandon Asberry said in a statement. \\\"This work is ongoing as we continue to invest in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead.\\\" In January, Google executives said they would offer buyouts to U.S.-based employees in the company's \\\"Platforms and Devices\\\" unit ahead of expected cuts. That unit houses more than 25,000 full-time employees who work on Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit and Nest. The company said it is supporting all affected employees, in line with local requirements, including time to explore and apply to different roles at Google. Cloud cuts The Alphabet-owned company's cloud layoffs affected the unit's sales operations, customer experience, internal deal and go-to-market teams, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they are not permitted to speak publicly. Cloud is one of the company's high-growth business units and benefits from AI products. For the fourth quarter, the cloud unit's revenue increased 30% from the year prior. Alphabet has been drawing profit from the cloud business as it tries to keep up with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Some affected employees' roles are being relocated to India and Mexico City, according to people familiar with the matter and internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. The company confirmed that the changes include consolidating or opening roles in other parts of the U.S and overseas. The largest employee presence for the cloud unit is still in the U.S., and that's not changing, the company added. The number of layoffs is unclear, but the company said it is small in quantity and that the organization continues to hire for critical sales and engineering roles. Bloomberg first reported the cuts to Google's cloud division Wednesday. WATCH: Google reportedly to be hit with EU charges of infringing on Apple, Meta platforms",

        "Extracted Article": "LONDON — British digital remittances company Zepz is laying off dozens of IT workers and is in the process of closing down business units in Poland and Kenya. Roughly 200 staff members will be impacted by the redundancy measures, two employees who were made redundant told CNBC, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter. As of January, London-headquartered Zepz — formerly known as WorldRemit — had a global headcount of 1,000 people, meaning the redundancies affect around 20% of its total workforce. The layoffs affect several IT functions at the company, including database administration, development operations and software engineering, the former employees said. Zepz confirmed to CNBC that it was reducing headcount in order to \\\"sustainably support the next phase of long-term strategic goals and continued growth.\\\" The company declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by the layoffs, with a spokesperson explaining that the redundancy process was ongoing. \\\"Following the successful completion of its replatforming efforts, bolstered by advanced automation and AI, Zepz has embarked on a strategic initiative to optimise operations across the organisation,\\\" a Zepz spokesperson told CNBC by email. \\\"This transformation has reinforced the technology foundation and reduced the need for certain operational and technical capacities, prompting a proposed reduction in roles as part of the overall plan,\\\" the spokesperson added. Zepz has been touted as one of Britain's fintech darlings. The company was founded by Ismail Ahmed, a Somalia-born British entrepreneur who fled the country during the Somali Civil War. Ahmed today serves as the company's non-executive chairman. The group was renamed Zepz following the acquisition of money transfer platform Sendwave in 2020, with the brand and WorldRemit coming under one parent company. 'Difficult choice' CNBC obtained a company memo announcing the cost-cutting measures shared by Zepz CEO Mark Lenhard internally in January. \\\"Today we are announcing a very difficult decision — proposed reductions in our team across all HQ functions, and most regions. And specifically we are proposing the closure of our Kenya and Poland employing entities,\\\" Lenhard said in the memo. Zepz touts itself as a \\\"remote-first employer,\\\" with regional offices in Kenya and Poland. \\\"This is a difficult choice, which impacts the lives of our colleagues and friends. This is also a choice which is critical to the success of our mission to serve immigrants everywhere. Both facts are true, at the same time,\\\" Lenhard said. \\\"To be clear, this is not a change of strategy. We're doubling down on our mission in an effort to expand our impact faster,\\\" he added. \\\"In some places, this will mean we'll need to continue to ruthlessly prioritize. In others, we're going to get more efficient. In many cases it will involve rethinking how we do things today.\\\" Zepz's spokesperson insisted that the IT worker layoffs \\\"will not impact customers in any region or market,\\\" and added that the firm \\\"remains committed to its mission of serving migrants worldwide, driving innovation, and delivering meaningful financial solutions to millions globally.\\\" This isn't the first time Zepz has cut a spate of roles to save on costs. In 2023, Zepz laid off 420 employees , which accounted for about 26% of its global headcount at the time. Later that year, Zepz slashed a further 30 roles across its people and marketing functions. Zepz has long been touted as a potential IPO candidate, but a timeline for this is unclear. Counting the likes of Accel, TCV and Leapfrog as investors, the startup was valued at $5 billion in 2021. The company announced a $267 million funding round last year. Zepz faces competition from several notable digital payments players including PayPal , Wise , Revolut and Remitly.

        "Extracted Article": "Workday said on Wednesday it will cut around 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its current workforce, as the human capital management firm invests heavily in artificial intelligence to counter a softer macroeconomic environment. Shares of the California-based company jumped over 4% in premarket trading. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs are necessary to prioritize investments such as artificial intelligence, while also freeing up resources to expand the company's presence in different countries. The layoffs come at a time when the human capital management industry has grappled with slower spending by enterprise clients as high interest rates have pressured tech budgets. Workday expects to incur around $230 million to $270 million in charges connected to the cost reduction plan, of which, around $60 million to $70 million is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter. As of Jan. 31 last year, the company had around 18,800 employees. Workday faces stiff competition from other players in a crowded industry as firms consolidate their position through acquisitions to take market share. Last month, Paychex said it will acquire Paycor for $4.1 billion in cash, while Automatic Data Processing acquired management services provider WorkForce Software for around $1.2 billion in cash in October. Workday also said it expects its fiscal fourth quarter and full-year financial results to be in line with or above its prior forecast. The company forecast annual subscription revenue of $7.70 billion in November while it expects fourth-quarter subscription revenue to be $2.03 billion - in line with analysts expectations, as per data compiled by LSEG. Workday also said it expects to close certain office spaces that it owns and the actions associated with the cost reduction plans should be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2026.",

        "Extracted Article": "Wayfair is exiting the German market and plans to cut as many as 730 jobs, or about 3% of its global workforce, as it looks to focus on new growth drivers such as physical retail, the company said Friday. About half of the affected employees will have the option to stay on with Wayfair if they agree to relocate to London, Boston or other locations where the company has a presence, finance chief Kate Gulliver told CNBC in an interview. The affected positions include corporate roles as well as roles on Wayfair's customer service and warehouse teams, she said. In a memo to employees shared with CNBC, founder and CEO Niraj Shah said it would take too much time and money for Wayfair to expand its business in Germany and the company's dollars would be better used for other growth initiatives. \\\"Scaling our market share and improving our unit economics in the German market has proven challenging due to factors such as the weak macroeconomic conditions for our category in Germany, the lower maturity of our offering, our current brand awareness, and our limited scale,\\\" wrote Shah. \\\"In our recent assessment, we concluded that achieving market-leading growth in Germany remained a long and costly endeavor, and one that is increasingly lagging the potential return we see in other areas. To ensure we align our resources with initiatives that can deliver the greatest impact, we made the difficult but necessary decision to reallocate efforts to areas with strong long-term potential where our current efforts are showing great progress,\\\" he wrote. Shares fell about 3% in early trading Friday. Germany, where Wayfair has been operating for 15 years, makes up a \\\"low single digit percentage\\\" of Wayfair's revenue, customers and orders, Gulliver said. The restructuring is expected to cost between $102 million and $111 million, which includes $40 million to $44 million in employee-related costs like severance, benefits, relocation and transition costs and around $62 million to $67 million in non-cash charges related to facility closures and other wind-down activities, Wayfair said in a securities filing. The company expects to make those payments over the next 12 months, but they are expected to be incurred across the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 — a six-month period set to conclude at the end of March. Wayfair expects to reinvest any savings from restructuring mostly across other core initiatives, such as its physical retail plans and its remaining international markets, it said in a securities filing. The company's guidance isn't changing, said Gulliver. Friday's layoffs are the fourth that Wayfair has implemented since summer 2022, but this move is less about cost savings and more about reallocating resources to initiatives that are actually making the company money, said Gulliver. \\\"We're not doing this because we're saying that we need some, you know, cost efficiency play, and so therefore we had to look for more costs and we identified Germany,\\\" said Gulliver. \\\"We see better ROI initiatives that we are already further along on that we can continue to invest in. So it's an investment prioritization, and [we're] going after areas like the U.K., Canada, etc. where we see a really exciting opportunity.\\\" Those initiatives include Wayfair's foray into physical retail , which began in earnest in May when it opened its first namesake store outside Chicago. Since the location opened, the company has enjoyed what Gulliver described as a \\\"halo effect,\\\" where online sales to customers who live near the store have increased. It plans to open another store or two in the U.S. \\\"in short order\\\" and also hopes to expand those doors to international markets such as Canada and the U.K., said Gulliver. \\\"Obviously, we want to nail it in the U.S. first,\\\" said Gulliver. \\\"But we are excited about the potential over time.\\\" Still, physical retail can be a massive capital expenditure. And Wayfair hasn't turned an annual net profit since 2020. Wayfair's decision comes as the company looks to boost topline growth in a sluggish housing market that has dampened demand for all things home. In the three months ended Sept. 30, sales fell 2% to $2.9 billion. \\\"It's always difficult to make a decision that impacts humans,\\\" she said. \\\"We care very deeply about the team there, and we're so appreciative of their work, but we do believe that this is the right next step for the business to allow us to focus on these higher ROI priorities.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Grabango, a venture-backed startup that was vying to take on Amazon in cashierless checkout technology, is shutting down after it was unable to raise enough money to stay afloat. \\\"Although the company established itself as a leader in checkout-free technology, it was not able to secure the funding it needed to continue providing service to its clients,\\\" a spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC on Wednesday. \\\"The company would like to thank its employees, investors, and clients for all their hard work and dedication.\\\" Food tech publication The Spoon reported earlier on Grabango's closure. Launched in 2016, Grabango was developing checkout-free technology that uses computer vision and machine learning to track and tally up items as shoppers grab them from store shelves. Will Glaser, Grabango's founder and CEO, is a longtime Bay Area technologist who cofounded music streaming service Pandora. The company employed roughly 100 employees, according to LinkedIn and Pitchbook. Grabango raised just over $73 million, Pitchbook data shows, with its most sizable financing round coming in 2021, before the market turned. In June of that year, Grabango raised $39 million in a round led by Commerce Ventures, with participation from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund as well as the venture arms of Unilever and Honeywell . In February of this year, Glaser told Axios the company had plans to go public \\\"in a couple of years at a $10 billion to $15 billion market cap.\\\" The IPO market has dried up since early 2022, with just three notable venture-backed companies debuting in the U.S. this year. The lack of liquidity has hammered the venture industry, making it harder for firms to launch new funds and for startups, outside of a select few AI companies, to raise capital. Based in Berkeley, California, Grabango was seen as one of the primary rivals to Amazon's cashierless checkout offering, called Just Walk Out. Other startups in the space include AiFi and Trigo. Grabango had inked deals with grocers including Aldi and Giant Eagle, along with convenience store chains 7-Eleven and Circle K. Amazon has targeted its Just Walk Out service to convenience stores and retailers in airports, stadiums and hospitals, among other venues. Amazon in April pulled its cashierless checkout technology from its U.S. Fresh stores and Whole Foods supermarkets. In a blog post following that decision, Glaser said Amazon's reliance on shelf sensor technology in its JWO system had \\\"proven to be its Achilles' heel.\\\" Glaser said Grabango eschewed shelf sensors in favor of computer vision which put it on a path for \\\"widespread adoption.\\\" \\\"This is a classic Tortoise and Hare parable, but with the players taking on surprising roles,\\\" Glaser wrote. \\\"The much larger Amazon lept to an early lead, but was unable to turn it into a sustained success. The more nimble Grabango, ironically, took the more difficult technical path, and is now reaping the benefits of its patience with a fundamentally more capable system.\\\" -- CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.

In an update published via its website, Northvolt said that following initial steps taken as part of a strategic review, the company had revised its scope of operations in Sweden \\\"to ensure that its resources are focused on accelerating production in large-scale cell manufacturing at Northvolt Ett.\\\" The strategic action requires Northvolt to reduce its global workforce by around 20% and a 25% reduction in Sweden, the firm said. It added that these measures were expected to result in the redundancy of roughly 1,600 employees, including 1,000 positions at its factory in Skellefteå in the north of the country. The company said all redundancies would be subject to ongoing union negotiations. Northvolt, which currently delivers batteries from its first gigafactory Northvolt Ett in Skellefteå, said in March that it had over 6,000 employees. It had warned on Sept. 9 of the need to take \\\"some difficult decisions on the size of our workforce to match the needs of a reduced scale of operations.\\\" At the time, Northvolt declined to say how many jobs were likely to be affected. Alongside plans to lay off staff, the cash-strapped company said it would suspend plans for a sizable expansion of Northvolt Ett, noting the project had been intended to provide an additional 30 gigawatt hours of annual cell manufacturing capacity. The announced measures come as part of a broader strategic review and in response to what Northvolt described as \\\"a challenging macroeconomic climate.\\\" Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Northvolt is one of Europe's most valuable privately-held tech firms that builds lithium-ion batteries for the electric vehicle industry. It has partnerships with a number of major European automakers, including Volkswagen and Volvo . Peter Carlsson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Northvolt, said in a statement that the company needed to focus all energy and investments into its core business. \\\"While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate,\\\" Carlsson said. \\\"Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we're taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt's future,\\\" he added. — CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",

The company does not operate its own bikes and scooters in many U.S. cities and has partnered with Bird and Spin, allowing riders to access them through the Lyft app. Lyft said it would incur about $34 million to $46 million in charges, largely related to asset disposal costs, and lay off about 1% of its nearly 3,000 employees at the end of last year. Cost savings from the restructuring, improved operations, and better sales strategies will help boost adjusted operating income by about $20 million on an annual basis by the end of next year, the company said. Lyft last month forecast a weak September quarter, raising concerns about the company's ability to cope with intense competition from Uber Technologies.

Most of the layoffs will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company said. That quarter ends next April. UiPath shares dropped about 7% on Tuesday to close at $11.93 and have now lost more than half their value this year. The Nasdaq is up 23% over that stretch. UiPath has faced a dramatic slowing of revenue growth following its IPO in 2021, which was one of the largest U.S. software offerings on record. While UiPath reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, the company lowered its revenue guidance for the full year, and said it now expects between $1.4 billion and $1.41 billion compared with previous guidance of $1.55 billion to $1.56 billion. Its current forecast would equal annual growth of about 7.5%, down from 24% the prior year. UiPath makes software that automates repetitive tasks. The company announced in May that CEO Rob Enslin was resigning effective June 1, and would be succeeded by co-founder Daniel Dines, who had stepped down as co-CEO in January. That move drove the stock down 30% . UiPath said Tuesday that it expects to incur $15 million to $20 million in costs related to the layoffs, and total restructuring costs between $17 million and $25 million.

        "Extracted Article": "Peloton announced Thursday that CEO Barry McCarthy will be stepping down and the company will lay off 15% of its staff because it \\\"simply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue.\\\" McCarthy, a former Spotify and Netflix executive, will become a strategic advisor to Peloton through the end of the year while Karen Boone, the company's chairperson, and director Chris Bruzzo will serve as interim co-CEOs. Boone most recently served as the CFO of Restoration Hardware while Bruzzo was a longtime executive at Electronic Arts . Peloton is seeking a permanent CEO. The company also announced a broad restructuring plan that will see its global headcount cut by 15%, or about 400 employees. It plans to continue to close retail showrooms and make changes to its international sales plan. The moves are designed to realign Peloton's cost structure with the current size of its business, it said in a news release. It's expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of fiscal 2025. About half of those savings are going to come from payroll reductions, while the rest will come from lower marketing spending, a reduced retail store footprint, and reduced IT and software spending, said finance chief Liz Coddington. The departments hit the hardest from the restructuring will be Peloton's research and development, marketing and international teams, Coddington said. \\\"This restructuring will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business,\\\" the company said. Peloton's shares surged more than 12% in premarket trading but opened lower after the company's conference call with Wall Street analysts concluded. Shares closed about 3% lower. Peloton board ready for its next CEO McCarthy took the helm of Peloton in February 2022 from founder John Foley and has spent the last two years restructuring the business and working to get it back to growth. As soon as he took over, he implemented mass layoffs to right size Peloton's cost structure, closed some of the company's splashy showrooms and enacted new strategies designed to grow membership. He overhauled Peloton's executive team, oversaw its rebrand and created new revenue drivers like the company's rental program. The last round of cuts, affecting 500 employees, was announced in October 2022. McCarthy later said the company's restructuring was \\\"complete\\\" and it was instead pivoting to \\\"growth.\\\" \\\"We are done now,\\\" McCarthy had said in November 2022 of the layoffs. \\\"There are no more heads to be taken out of the business.\\\" Contrary to Peloton's founder, McCarthy redirected Peloton's attention to its app as a means to capture members who may not be able to afford the company's pricey bikes or treadmills but could be interested in taking its digital classes. In a letter to staff, McCarthy said the company now needed to implement layoffs again because it wouldn't be able to generate sustainable free cash flow with its current cost structure. Peloton hasn't turned a profit since December 2020 and it can only burn cash for so long when it has more than $1 billion in debt on its balance sheet. \\\"Achieving positive [free cash flow] makes Peloton a more attractive borrower, which is important as the company turns its attention to the necessary task of successfully refinancing its debt,\\\" McCarthy said in the memo. In a letter to shareholders, the company said it is \\\"mindful\\\" of the timing of its debt maturities, which include convertible notes and a term loan. It said it is working closely with its lenders at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs on a \\\"refinancing strategy.\\\" \\\"Overall, our refinancing goals are to deleverage and extend maturities at a reasonable blended cost of capital,\\\" the company said. \\\"We are encouraged by the support and inbound interest from our existing lenders and investors and we look forward to sharing more about this topic.\\\" In a news release, Boone thanked McCarthy for his contributions. \\\"Barry joined Peloton during an incredibly challenging time for the business. During his tenure, he laid the foundation for scalable growth by steadily rearchitecting the cost structure of the business to create stability and to reach the important milestone of achieving positive free cash flow,\\\" Boone said. \\\"With a strong leadership team in place and the Company now on solid footing, the Board has decided that now is an appropriate time to search for the next CEO of Peloton.\\\" During a conference call with analysts, Boone said Peloton's board is looking for a leader who can \\\"architect and lead the next phase of growth for the company.\\\" Disappointing earnings, lowered outlook Also on Thursday, Peloton announced its fiscal third-quarter results and fell short of Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line. Here's how the connected fitness company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Loss per share: 45 cents vs. a loss of 37 cents expected Revenue: $718 million vs. $723 million expected The company's reported net loss for the three-month period that ended March 31 was $167.3 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with a loss of $275.9 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales dropped to $718 million, down about 4% from $748.9 million a year earlier. Peloton has tried a little bit of everything to get the company back to sales growth. It removed the free membership option from its fitness app, expanded its corporate wellness offerings and partnered with mega-brands like Lululemon to grow membership, but none of the initiatives have been enough to grow sales. For the ninth quarter in a row, Peloton's revenue fell during its fiscal third quarter, when compared with the year-ago period. It hasn't seen sales grow compared with the year ago quarter since December 2021, when the company's stationary bikes were still in high demand and many hadn't yet returned to gyms amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The business is continuing to bleed money and hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020. For its current fiscal year, Peloton lowered its outlook for paid connected fitness subscriptions, app subscriptions and revenue. It reduced its connected fitness subscription outlook by 30,000 members, or 1%, to 2.97 million as it looks toward its current quarter, which is typically its toughest because people tend to work out less in the spring and summer months. \\\"Our Paid Connected Fitness Subscription guidance reflects an updated outlook for hardware sales based on current demand trends and expectations for seasonally lower demand,\\\" the company said. Peloton now expects app subscriptions to drop by 150,000, or 19%, to 605,000. \\\"We are maintaining our disciplined approach to App media spend as we evaluate our App tiers, pricing, and refine the Paid App subscription acquisition funnel,\\\" the company said. As a result of expected downturns in its subscription sales, Peloton now projects full-year revenue to come in at $2.69 billion, a reduction of about $25 million, or 1%. That's below expectations of $2.71 billion, according to LSEG. However, the company raised its full-year outlook for gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. It now expects total gross margin to grow by 50 basis points, to 44.5%, and adjusted EBITDA to grow by $37 million, to negative $13 million. \\\"This increase is largely driven by outperformance from Q3, combined with lower media spend and cost reductions from today's announced restructuring plan,\\\" the company said. The quest to reach positive free cash flow Last February, McCarthy set a goal of returning Peloton to revenue growth within a year. When it failed to reach that milestone, McCarthy pushed it back and said he now expects the company to be back to growth in June, at the end of the current fiscal year. McCarthy had also expected Peloton to reach positive free cash flow by June — a goal the company said it reached early during its third quarter. It's the first time Peloton has hit that mark in 13 quarters. In a letter to shareholders, Peloton said it generated $8.6 million in free cash flow but it's unclear how sustainable that number is. Last month, CNBC reported that Peloton hadn't been paying its vendors on time , which could temporarily pad its balance sheet. Data from business intelligence firm Creditsafe showed that Peloton's late payments to vendors spiked in December and again in February after improving in January. The company didn't provide specific guidance on what investors can expect with free cash flow in the quarters ahead but said it does expect to \\\"deliver modest positive free cash flow\\\" in its current quarter and in fiscal 2025. \\\"While we firmly intend to return the business to growth, with today's announced cost reductions, we're lowering our cost base and we see a path to positive free cash flow without requiring a significant improvement in growth to get there,\\\" Coddington said on the conference call. \\\"I also want to clarify that we have carefully reviewed these cost measures to make sure that we do still have the capability to invest in innovation so that the business can grow profitably.\\\" Part of the reason why Peloton had failed to reach positive free cash flow is because it's simply not selling enough of its hardware, which is costly to make and has become less popular since the Covid-19 pandemic ended and people returned to gyms. \\\"Looking at the numbers in more detail, the biggest problem lies in the part of the business where Peloton first made its name: exercise equipment. Revenue for connected fitness products plummeted by 13.6% over last year in a sign that consumers are still cooling on equipment that, while aesthetically and technically pleasing, is very expensive,\\\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a note. \\\"A lot of people who want Peloton equipment already have it and are not likely to upgrade anytime soon; the balance of the market is either not interested or needs a lot of persuasion to buy into Peloton.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Just ahead of its blowout first-quarter earnings report on April 25, Google laid off at least 200 employees from its \\\"Core\\\" teams, in a reorganization that will include moving some roles to India and Mexico, CNBC has learned. The Core unit is responsible for building the technical foundation behind the company's flagship products and for protecting users' online safety, according to Google's website . Core teams include key technical units from information technology, its Python developer team, technical infrastructure, security foundation, app platforms, core developers, and various engineering roles. At least 50 of the positions eliminated were in engineering at the company's offices in Sunnyvale, California, filings show. Many Core teams will hire corresponding roles in Mexico and India, according to internal documents viewed by CNBC. Asim Husain, vice president of Google Developer Ecosystem, announced news of the layoffs to his team in an email last week. He also spoke at a town hall and told employees that this was the biggest planned reduction for his team this year, an internal document shows. \\\"We intend to maintain our current global footprint while also expanding in high-growth global workforce locations so that we can operate closer to our partners and developer communities,\\\" Husain wrote in the email. Alphabet has been slashing headcount since early last year, when the company announced plans to eliminate about 12,000 jobs , or 6% of its workforce, following a downturn in the online ad market. Even with digital advertising rebounding recently, Alphabet has continued downsizing, with layoffs across multiple organizations this year. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat announced in mid-April that the company's finance department would undergo restructuring, entailing layoffs and moving positions to Bangalore and Mexico City. The company's search boss, Prabhakar Raghavan, told employees at an all-hands meeting in March that Google plans to build teams closer to users in key markets, including India and Brazil, where labor is cheaper than in the U.S. The latest cuts come as the company enjoys its fastest growth rate since early 2022, alongside improving profit margins. Last week, Alphabet reported a 15% jump in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier and announced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion buyback. \\\"Announcements of this sort may leave many of you feeling uncertain or frustrated,\\\" Husain wrote in the email to developers. He added that his message to developers is that the changes \\\"are in service of our broader goals\\\" as a company. The teams involved in the reorganization have been key to the company's developer tools, an area Google is streamlining as it incorporates more artificial intelligence into the products. In February, Google announced a major rebrand of its chatbot from Bard to Gemini, the same name as the suit of AI models that power it. Alphabet is gearing up for its annual developer conference, Google I\\u002FO, on May 14, where the company traditionally reveals new developer products and tools underway during the prior year. Husain said in a memo explaining the developer changes that generative AI is at an \\\"inflection point.\\\" \\\"Recent advances in Generative AI across the industry, including Google's Gemini, are changing the very nature of software development as we know it,\\\" Husain wrote. In a separate email, Pankaj Rohatgi, Google's security engineering vice president, told his team, \\\"In order to optimize for our business goals, we are expanding work to other locations, which will result in some role eliminations and proposed role eliminations.\\\" The Core layoffs also include the governance and protected data group, which will be at the center of regulatory challenges facing the company, particularly as lawmakers across the globe focus more on developments in AI. The European Union's Digital Markets Act, which went into effect in March , aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices in tech. Evan Kotsovinos, Google's vice president of governance and protected data, addressed the upcoming changes last week. Kotsovinos in an email said the team's success means responding to \\\"escalating regulatory focus\\\" and is contingent on \\\"moving faster.\\\" Raghavan, Google's senior vice president overseeing search, recently referenced heightened competition, a more challenging regulatory environment, and slower organic growth as the company's \\\"new operating reality.\\\" When reached for comment, Google confirmed the Core reorganization and layoffs, and a spokesperson told CNBC that employees will be able to apply for open roles within Google and to access outplacement services. \\\"As we've said, we're responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,\\\" the spokesperson said in an email. \\\"A number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities.\\\" WATCH: Google alumni-led startups turn up pressure on top AI companies",

        "Extracted Article": "Beleaguered artificial intelligence startup Stability is laying off employees after the exit of its controversial former CEO Emad Mostaque. Stability, which is behind the popular Stable Diffusion text-to-image model, made more than 20 of its employees redundant to \\\"right-size\\\" the business after a period of unsustainable growth, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. The company's newly appointed co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte told employees in an email Wednesday night that the firm needed to \\\"restructure parts of the business, which will sadly mean saying goodbye to some colleagues.\\\" \\\"Those who are affected by this have been notified individually and we will be supporting them throughout this period,\\\" Wong and Laforte, who were previously chief operating officer and chief technology officer at the company, respectively, said in the internal memo. Stability AI's layoffs amount to about 10% of its global headcount, according to publicly available data online which shows the firm employs around 200 people in total. The employees affected by the measures are mostly on the operational side of the business and have been notified of their redundancies, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC under condition of anonymity as they were not able to speak publicly on the matter. Last month, Stability announced its former CEO, Mostaque, was leaving the company to \\\"pursue decentralized AI,\\\" and would be replaced by Wong and Laforte. Mostaque's departure follows media reports throwing doubt on his credentials. A June 2023 Forbes report said that Mostaque misled people including his own investors about receiving a master's degree from Oxford University, as well as the nature of a partnership with Amazon which Stability characterized as a strategic deal but was nothing more than a standard cloud computing leasing contract. Mostaque's response at the time was that several of Forbes' allegations were \\\"false accusations and misrepresentations.\\\" He said he didn't receive his Oxford University degree because he didn't attend his graduation ceremony but had arranged to receive his degrees by post. He also doubled down on the deal with Amazon and it's cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services by describing it as a \\\"strategic business alliance\\\" that saw AWS build an \\\"incredibly rare dedicated compute cluster\\\" completed to the requirements of Stability. Stability AI is still searching for a permanent CEO to fill the top leadership role. The company said it continues to operate as normal and is still releasing new products, having only recently announced developer APIs, or application programming interfaces, for its Stable Diffusion 3 AI model. You can read the full memo from co-CEOs Wong and Christian Laforte below: Dear team, As you know, over the past couple of weeks the Leadership team have been working hard on a strategic plan to reduce our cost-base, strengthen support with our investors and partners, and enable our teams to continue developing and releasing innovative products. Following a review of the global team, we have determined the need to restructure parts of the business, which will sadly mean saying goodbye to some colleagues. Those who are affected by this have been notified individually and we will be supporting them throughout this period. These decisions have not been taken lightly and they are intended to right-size parts of the business and focus our operations, which is critical to setting us on a more sustainable path - and to put us in the best possible position to continue developing cutting-edge models and products. Products like the Stable Diffusion 3 API strengthen our deep-tech leadership and demonstrate our unique, systemic importance to the AI ecosystem. We will meet as planned on Thursday for our regular town hall and we encourage you to ask any questions you might have of our Leadership team in the form that will be sent out shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to discuss any concerns with your manager. We would like to thank everyone for their dedication and contributions. We recognize the challenges we face, but we have a plan in place. Through the hard work and commitment of this team, we are making progress every day, moving us steadily in the right direction. Best wishes, Shan Shan & Christian",

        "Extracted Article": "IBM on Tuesday told employees in its marketing and communications division that it's slashing the size of its staff, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Jonathan Adashek, IBM's chief communications officer, made the announcement in a roughly seven-minute meeting with staffers in the unit, said the person, who asked not to be named because the news hasn't been made public. In December, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told CNBC that the company was \\\"massively upskilling all of our employees on AI,\\\" after it announced a plan in August to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM said on its earnings call in January of last year that it was cutting 3,900 positions. \\\"In 4Q earnings earlier this year, IBM disclosed a workforce rebalancing charge that would represent a very low single digit percentage of IBM's global workforce, and we expect to exit 2024 at roughly the same level of employment as we entered with,\\\" IBM told CNBC in a statement. The latest cuts come alongside another round of downsizing in the tech industry. So far this year, some 204 tech companies have cut almost 50,000 jobs, according to the website Layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for layoffs since March, as Alphabet, Amazon and Unity all announced job cuts. IBM has returned to growth in the past couple years, but expansion remains muted. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 4% from a year earlier even as earnings topped estimates. CFO James Kavanaugh spoke of workforce rebalancing on the earnings call. The company has been trying to fit into the emerging AI narrative, which has been the big story across tech since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. In May, IBM announced WatsonX, billed as a development studio for companies to \\\"train, tune and deploy\\\" machine-learning models. The book of business for generative AI and Watsonx products doubled in size from the third quarter of 2023, when it was in the low hundreds of millions, according to IBM's earnings call in January. IBM faces steep competition in the enterprise AI realm. Microsoft , Google , Amazon and others have similar offerings, and IBM has long been viewed as falling behind in the AI race, particularly when it comes to making money from its products. \\\"I think that's a fair criticism, that we were slow to monetize and slow to make really consumable the learnings from Watson winning Jeopardy,\\\" Krishna told CNBC in December . \\\"The mistake we made was that I think we went after very big, monolithic answers, which the world was not ready to absorb.\\\" Nearly two years ago, IBM sold its Watson Health unit for an undisclosed amount to private equity firm Francisco Partners.

EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.

On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent's Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce .

The company expects its restructuring plan will be \\\"substantially complete\\\" by the end of December. \\\"We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,\\\" Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. \\\"We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.\\\" Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its \\\"biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.\\\" During the company's third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims. — CNBC's Steve Kovach contributed to this report.

        "Extracted Article": "Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares of Cisco were down as much as 9% in extended trading. It's the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay, Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi. In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here's how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected Cisco's revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement . Net income fell to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. The company has yet to close its $28 billion acquisition of monitoring and security software maker Splunk . Cisco now expects to complete the deal late in the first calendar quarter or early in the second quarter, CEO Chuck Robbins said on a conference call with analysts. Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. With respect to guidance for the fiscal third quarter, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue. For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue. The guidance excludes an impact from Splunk. Robbins flagged challenges weighing on the guidance during the call. \\\"In terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty,\\\" Robbins said. \\\"As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations.\\\" Demand remains sluggish among telecommunications and cable service provider clients, Robbins said. Cisco said it was increasing its dividend by a penny to 40 cents per share. — CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.

The news came as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell roughly in line with analysts' revenue estimates. Shares of the company fell 5% in extended trading. The layoffs are focused in part on middle management and creating a flatter organizational structure, according to Instacart, as well as focusing teams on larger projects, such as advertising efforts on Roku, Google Ads and more. Three top executives are also departing the company for personal reasons, according to Instacart: Chief Operating Officer Asha Sharma, Chief Technology Officer Varouj Chitilian and chief architect JJ Zhuang. Instacart will only backfill the CTO role. The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $803 million, roughly in line with the $804 million that Wall Street expected, according to analyst estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. In September, Instacart went public in one of the first significant venture-backed tech IPOs since December 2021. In its prospectus, the company said it would focus on incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning features into the platform, and that it expected to rely on those features to \\\"drive future growth in our business.\\\" Instacart shoppers and drivers deliver goods in more than 5,500 cities from more than 85,000 grocers and other stores, according to its website.

        "Extracted Article": "Social media company Snap said Monday that it will lay off 10% of its global workforce , or around 500 employees, in part to \\\"promote in-person collaboration.\\\" The Snapchat maker's shares fell as much 3% in morning trading before paring back losses to close down 1.8%. The company has executed multiple rounds of layoffs since 2022, most recently in November , when it trimmed a small number of product employees. Snap expects it will incur charges ranging from $55 million to $75 million, according to a regulatory filing. The company's last major round of cuts was in August 2022, when it laid off 20% of staff and restructured its business lines. \\\"We are reorganizing our team to reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration. We are focused on supporting our departing team members,\\\" a Snap spokesperson told CNBC. The social media platform is the latest tech company to continue cutting in 2024. Nearly 24,000 tech workers lost their jobs in January alone. Already this month, cybersecurity and identity company Okta and Zoom have laid off staff. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, one of several social media executives to face scrutiny over the damage their platforms caused young people. Investors generally support tech companies' efforts to trim back headcount. Meta , for example, implemented a \\\"year of efficiency\\\" that saw brutal cuts to its workforce. The Facebook owner's stock reached an all-time high after it reported strong earnings and announced its first-ever dividend. Amazon and Alphabet have also pursued similar headcount reductions. Like Google and Facebook, Snapchat's revenue is highly dependent on digital advertising spend . The company has stuttered in some quarters, but managed to snap a streak of revenue declines in its most recent quarter. The company has also initiated a $500 million share buyback program. Snap stock remains below its debut price and well off its 2021 high of around $83.

Okta also reaffirmed its fourth-quarter and full-year guidance in a securities filing. CEO Todd McKinnon said in his message that the \\\"reality is that costs are still too high.\\\" Okta shares rose around 3.6% in premarket trading on the news. Okta is only the latest tech company to trim headcount in the opening weeks of 2024. Nearly 24,000 tech workers lost their jobs in January alone, even as many tech companies saw their stock prices continue to grow. McKinnon said the firm needed to be more \\\"thoughtful\\\" about where it was investing to achieve \\\"long-term success.\\\" The firm underwent its last round of layoffs in February 2023. It was a smaller round of cuts, affecting about 300 employees, and at the time, McKinnon said prior overhiring had led to unsustainable staffing levels. Read McKinnon's full message below. Hi Everyone, After a thoughtful FY25 business planning process, the leadership team and I have made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction impacting about 7% of our company, or approximately 400 people. If you work in the U.S., you will receive an email in the next 15 minutes notifying you if your role is impacted or not. If your role is impacted, your leadership will schedule a meeting today to discuss next steps. For employees outside the U.S. who have been identified as impacted or at risk, the notification process may be different based on local laws and practices. I know this is difficult news, and I'd like to provide some context on how we reached this decision. In order to grow profitably, we need to run the business with greater efficiency. While we've taken steps in the right direction, the reality is that costs are still too high. We need to be mindful of our overall spend so we can continue to invest in the areas, products, and routes to market with the most opportunity. To capture our massive potential and build an iconic company, we must be thoughtful about where we place our bets. This action is a proactive measure to help set the company up for long-term success. To the impacted employees, I am deeply sorry and we thank you for your many contributions. We are committed to supporting you during this transition and providing all possible resources to help you through this time. Impacted employees in the U.S. will receive transition support that includes additional time on payroll, the March RSU vest (if eligible), cash severance, extended healthcare coverage, job placement resources, and support for anyone on a company-sponsored visa. Outside of the U.S., our processes and severance will align with local laws and practices, including consultations with potentially affected employees, where appropriate, before any decisions are confirmed. Our priority today is managing this transition as respectfully as possible. As we navigate these changes, remember that Okta is critical infrastructure for 18,800 organizations around the world. We're looking forward to the work ahead with Okta in the right position to extend our leadership position and execute our vision to free everyone to safely use any technology.

January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google said it's eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions. In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it's laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce. Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family.

Shares of iRobot fell 10% in morning trading on the news. The fate of the deal was plunged into uncertainty after The Wall Street Journal reported that the European Union would not offer regulatory approval. The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, launched a probe in July, saying that the proposed deal could result in Amazon hindering iRobot rivals from competing on Amazon's online marketplace. The commission argued that Amazon could delist or reduce rival products' prominence in search results or elsewhere. \\\"Our in-depth investigation preliminarily showed that the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot's rivals by restricting or degrading access to the Amazon Stores,\\\" Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice president, said in a statement. She added that Amazon's control over the marketplace \\\"could have restricted competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners, leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for consumers.\\\" \\\"We're disappointed that Amazon's acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,\\\" David Zapolsky, senior vice president and general counsel at Amazon, said in a release. iRobot said it would focus on margin improvements, reduce spending on research and development, and pause all work on \\\"non-floorcare\\\" products, including its air purifiers and robotic lawn mowers. \\\"The termination of the agreement with Amazon is disappointing, but iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better,\\\" iRobot's Angle said in a release. Amazon will pay iRobot a previously agreed upon $94 million breakup fee. The terminated deal, first announced in 2022, would have originally valued iRobot at roughly $1.7 billion. The robotic vacuum maker has a market capitalization of under $400 million, following Monday's news and prior reports that the EU would move to block the deal. In July, iRobot entered into a $200 million financing facility from the Carlyle Group, in order to fund the company's operations as a stopgap until the Amazon deal closed. Amazon declined to provide a comment beyond the release. Regulators around the world have moved to scrutinize large technology companies, citing potential anti-competitive effects. Amazon is also one of the subjects of a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into the investments and partnerships between Big Tech and artificial intelligence developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI. In Europe, both Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the EU's European Commission have delayed or halted several deals. Those include Meta 's acquisition of Giphy, Adobe 's terminated acquisition of Figma and Microsoft's investment in OpenAI , as well as Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard . — CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed reporting.

SAP said it now expects 10 billion euros ($10.85 billion) in 2025 adjusted operating profit. That's down 2 billion euros from its previous outlook because of share-based compensation, but up by 500 million euros due to planned efficiencies from the restructuring.

The company plans to lay off around 1,650 employees, including 19% of its corporate team, with a focus on people in management and leadership positions, Wayfair said. The restructuring – the third Wayfair has implemented since summer 2022 – is expected to save the company about $280 million, it said. Shares of Wayfair surged 10% on Friday after the news was announced. \\\"The changes announced today reflect a return to our core principles on resource allocation,\\\" Wayfair's co-founder and CEO, Niraj Shah, said in a statement. \\\"Although persistent category weakness makes revenue growth challenging, we remain encouraged by the share gains we continue to see.\\\" The layoffs come after Hasbro , Etsy and Macy's all announced cuts to their workforces as retailers contend with slowing demand and an uncertain economy. At the height of the holiday shopping season in mid-December, Hasbro and Etsy announced staff reductions of 1,100 and 225 workers, respectively, and on Thursday, Macy's said it plans to cut more than 2,300 employees , or 3.5% of its workforce. The department store retailer also has plans to close five stores. Wayfair said the cuts were not related to fourth-quarter performance but were rather a proactive move to get the company back to its core structure. During the pandemic, Wayfair saw its business explode as stuck-at-home consumers used stimulus dollars and savings to splurge on home goods like furniture and decor. It saw annualized sales go from $9 billion to $18 billion \\\"almost overnight\\\" and needed to boost its headcount to meet the demand, Shah said in a memo to employees Friday. However, as the virus' impact began to wane, the home goods sector overall started to see a pullback in demand. As a result, Wayfair has needed to make cuts to ensure its staffing levels are proportionate to how much business it's doing. \\\"By mid 2022 it was clear we were in a bust period. It was also clear that we had gone overboard with corporate hiring during Covid,\\\" Shah said. \\\"As everyone here knows, we've had two significant corporate restructurings since 2022 to try to right-size this. Each time we used our best judgment, identified the cost target we needed to hit, and believed we were resizing to the right point. \\\"After each reduction we have gotten more of our goals done faster. I believe we need to stay focused as a company on what committed small teams can accomplish. In many ways, having too many great people is worse than having too few,\\\" he said. \\\"With too few, you get a lot done quickly, but you may not get everything done that you want. But having too many causes inefficiency, coordination costs, and investments in lower return activities. That is what we have been experiencing and what we need to end.\\\" In the latest reductions, the company sought to eliminate senior people in certain areas who had \\\"too much time\\\" and spent that time meeting with other senior leaders instead of actually executing, it said. Wayfair also wants to rightsize the ratio of engineers to engineer partners, such as those in business, product, design, research and analytics roles, because an excess of those positions doesn't \\\"create better technology outcomes and rather will do the opposite,\\\" Shah said. \\\"We are gaining forward momentum due to everyone's dedicated efforts. Our toughest stretch is now behind us. And I think our best year is right in front of us,\\\" Shah said. The company does plan to rebuild portions of its headcount throughout the year but will focus on lower-ranking jobs and positions that execute on actions, rather than leadership roles that oversee those actions, the company said. If revenue remains flat this year for Wayfair, the company expects it will bring in $600 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2024, up from a previous expectation of $450 million.

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon is laying off about 30 employees in its Buy with Prime unit, CNBC has learned, as it continues to look for ways to trim costs. The cuts affect fewer than 5% of staff in the Buy with Prime division, Amazon said. Buy with Prime is a service that lets online stores offer the same two-day shipping benefits available to Prime subscribers. Amazon has expanded the program since its launch in April 2022, including tie-ups with Shopify and Salesforce . Amazon didn't say how many staffers are in its Buy with Prime segment. \\\"We regularly review the structure of our teams and make adjustments based on the needs of the business and, following a recent review, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles on our Buy with Prime team,\\\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said Buy with Prime remains \\\"a top priority for Amazon\\\" and the company plans to continue investing \\\"significant resources\\\" in the program. Some of the affected employees worked in Amazon's multichannel fulfillment unit, which sits alongside Buy with Prime under the \\\"Project Santos\\\" organization, overseen by Peter Larsen, a longtime vice president at the company, a person with knowledge of the cuts said. Multichannel fulfillment allows merchants to ship and store products using Amazon's services regardless of whether they're selling on the home site. Amazon has cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company as part of rolling layoffs that began in late 2022. Job reductions have continued this year, with Amazon letting go staffers in its Prime Video , MGM, Twitch, Audible and Amazon Pay units last week. Other tech companies including Google , Discord, Xerox and Unity have also announced layoffs since the start of the new year. Amazon said it's assisting Buy with Prime employees who were laid off in finding new roles elsewhere within the company. Employees will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.

        "Extracted Article": "Etsy is laying off 11% of its workforce at the height of the holiday season as the e-commerce giant looks to restructure its business and streamline costs against a \\\"very challenging\\\" macro and competitive environment, the company announced Wednesday. Approximately 225 employees will be cut from Etsy's workforce, which will bring the headcount for the core Etsy marketplace to about 1,770 people, similar to the company's headcount in early 2022 and above 2020 levels. Etsy CEO Josh Silverman noted in a letter to employees that Etsy's marketplace — known for selling handmade items and connecting buyers with local artisans across the globe — has more than doubled in size since 2019 but said today's realities call for sweeping changes. \\\"We are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and [gross merchandise sales] has remained essentially flat since 2021,\\\" the letter reads. \\\"This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them. At the same time, employee expenses have grown, even as we have introduced significant cost-cutting measures and adjusted or paused hiring plans. This is ultimately not a sustainable trajectory and we must change it.\\\" The news comes alongside updated fourth-quarter guidance for Etsy. The company now expects gross merchandise sales to decline between 1% and 2% during the period from the year-ago quarter and revenue to increase between 2% and 3%. It's expecting adjusted EBITDA margin of between 27% and 28%, up from previous guidance of 26% to 27%. Shares of Etsy closed 2% lower following the announcement, after falling as much as 7% earlier in the day. \\\"Etsy is intensely focused on reigniting growth, driving sales for our nearly 7 million sellers around the world, and delivering value to all of our stakeholders. Today, we announced that we are reorganizing our internal structure so that we can double down on these efforts, which unfortunately means saying goodbye to approximately 225 of our colleagues,\\\" Silverman said in a statement to CNBC. The layoffs come two days after toymaker Hasbro announced it was cutting 1,100 employees as it grapples with soft sales that have continued into the crucial holiday shopping season. Hasbro had about 6,300 employees as of earlier this year, according to a company fact sheet . Etsy's layoffs will cost between $25 million and $30 million, the bulk of which will be used for severance payments, employee benefits and other related costs, the company said in a securities filing . Over time, the restructuring is expected to \\\"deliver meaningful operational efficiencies and cost savings and\\u002For cost avoidance,\\\" especially when it comes to salary costs and benefits. The restructuring is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2024. As part of the restructuring, Etsy's chief marketing officer Ryan Scott will be leaving the company and his position will be consolidated under the chief operating officer role, which is currently held by Raina Moskowitz, a former American Express executive. Etsy's chief human resources officer Kimaria Seymour will also be leaving the company and will be replaced by Toni Thompson, the company's current vice president of global people and talent strategy. Considering the layoffs come in the middle of the holiday season when many employees are shopping for gifts for their loved ones, Etsy said it would pay affected staff through at least Jan. 2, even though the last working day for most staff will be Wednesday. They'll receive severance of 16 weeks of base pay, plus one week for each full year of service, along with other benefits such as extended COBRA health insurance benefits and the ability to keep their company laptop.

        "Extracted Article": "Spotify shares closed up more than 7% Monday after the music streaming service said it is laying off 17% of its workforce, in a dramatic move aimed at reducing its costs and adjusting for a slowdown in growth. In an email sent to staff, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said that Spotify was taking \\\"substantial action to rightsize our costs,\\\" adding that the company took on too many employees over the years 2020 and 2021, when capital was cheap and tech companies could invest significant sums into team expansion. The latest round of cuts equates to roughly 1,500 jobs, according to a CNBC source familiar with the matter who preferred to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. A Spotify spokesperson wouldn't comment on the exact number of roles affected by the measure. \\\"Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business – one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future,\\\" Ek said in an internal memo that was shared on Spotify's website. \\\"While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.\\\" It comes despite Spotify reporting a 65 million euro ($70.7 million) profit for the third quarter, citing lower spend on marketing and personnel. Spotify raised the prices of its subscription plans earlier this year and has been expanding into podcasts and audio books. The latest round of redundancies follows successive cuts at the company, which like other growth-oriented tech firms has been forced to cut back on costs in the last year or so due to higher interest rates and a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Wells Fargo analysts said Monday that the layoffs are likely a sign of Spotify's continued focus \\\"on achieving its profitability targets\\\" rather than a reaction to economic headwinds. They also noted that the headcount reductions could supply a nearly 2% reduction of operating expenses in 2024. Spotify cut 6% of its workforce , or about 600 employees, at the start of the year. The company then laid off 2% of staff, equivalent to roughly 200 roles, in June. Spotify shares have more than doubled this year. Here's the full memo Ek sent to staff earlier Monday: Team, Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business – one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future. While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities. This brings me to a decision that will mean a significant step change for our company. To align Spotify with our future goals and ensure we are right-sized for the challenges ahead, I have made the difficult decision to reduce our total headcount by approximately 17% across the company. I recognize this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us. For those leaving, we're a better company because of your dedication and hard work. Thank you for sharing your talents with us. I hope you know that your contributions have impacted more than half a billion people and millions of artists, creators, and authors around the world in profound ways. I realize that for many, a reduction of this size will feel surprisingly large given the recent positive earnings report and our performance. We debated making smaller reductions throughout 2024 and 2025. Yet, considering the gap between our financial goal state and our current operational costs, I decided that a substantial action to rightsize our costs was the best option to accomplish our objectives. While I am convinced this is the right action for our company, I also understand it will be incredibly painful for our team. To understand this decision, I think it is important to assess Spotify with a clear, objective lens. In 2020 and 2021, we took advantage of the opportunity presented by lower-cost capital and invested significantly in team expansion, content enhancement, marketing, and new verticals. These investments generally worked, contributing to Spotify's increased output and the platform's robust growth this past year. However, we now find ourselves in a very different environment. And despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big. When we look back on 2022 and 2023, it has truly been impressive what we have accomplished. But, at the same time, the reality is much of this output was linked to having more resources. By most metrics, we were more productive but less efficient. We need to be both. While we have done some work to mitigate this challenge and become more efficient in 2023, we still have a ways to go before we are both productive and efficient. Today, we still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing work around the work rather than contributing to opportunities with real impact. More people need to be focused on delivering for our key stakeholders – creators and consumers. In two words, we have to become relentlessly resourceful. I know you will all be anxious to hear the next steps about how this process will work. If you are an impacted employee, you will receive a calendar invite within the next two hours from HR for a one-on-one conversation. These meetings will take place before the end of the day on Tuesday, and while Katarina will provide more detail on all of the specifics, please know the following will apply to all of these bandmates: Severance pay: We will start with a baseline for all employees, with the average employee receiving approximately five months of severance. This will be calculated based on local notice period requirements and employee tenure. PTO: All accrued and unused vacation will be paid out to any departing employee. Healthcare: We will continue to cover healthcare for employees during their severance period. Immigration support: For employees whose immigration status is connected with their employment, HRBPs are working with each impacted individual in concert with our mobility team. Career Support: All employees will be eligible for outplacement services for two months. For the team that will remain at Spotify, I know this decision will be difficult for many. Please know we are focused on treating our impacted colleagues with the respect and compassion they deserve. Looking Ahead The decision to reduce our team size is a hard but crucial step towards forging a stronger, more efficient Spotify for the future. But it also highlights that we need to change how we work. In Spotify's early days, our success was hard won. We had limited resources and had to make the most of every asset. Our ingenuity and creativity were what set us apart. As we've grown, we've moved too far away from this core principle of resourcefulness. The Spotify of tomorrow must be defined by being relentlessly resourceful in the ways we operate, innovate, and tackle problems. This kind of resourcefulness transcends the basic definition – it's about preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity. Embracing this leaner structure will also allow us to invest our profits more strategically back into the business. With a more targeted approach, every investment and initiative becomes more impactful, offering greater opportunities for success. This is not a step back; it's a strategic reorientation. We're still committed to investing and making bold bets, but now, with a more focused approach, ensuring Spotify's continued profitability and ability to innovate. Lean doesn't mean small ambitions; it means smarter, more impactful paths to achieve them. Today is a difficult but important day for the company. To be very clear, my commitment to our mission and belief in our ability to achieve it has never been stronger. I hope you will join me on Wednesday for Unplugged to discuss how we move forward together. A reduction of this size will make it necessary to change the way we work, and we will share much more about what this will mean in the days and weeks ahead. Just as 2023 marked a new chapter for us, so will 2024 as we build an even stronger Spotify. – Daniel –CNBC's Drew Richardson contributed to this article.",

That follows a separate round of layoffs the company embarked on earlier this year. In May, Zepz cut 26% of its workforce, citing duplication of roles that resulted from its acquisition of Sendwave, another money transfer service. Zepz hasn't been immune to the effects of slowing momentum in the digital payments space, which has forced companies to cut back on costs and, in several cases, lay off staff. The company reached profitability for the first time last year. Zepz said that, with this in mind, its focus is on \\\"innovation and continuous improvement for our users, delivering meaningful products that make finance more convenient and accessible to migrant communities.\\\" \\\"To fully realise our mission to unlock the prosperity of cross-border communities, we sometimes need to make tough decisions,\\\" Zepz told CNBC. Zepz has long been touted as an IPO candidate in the U.K., but its timeline on reaching that goal is currently unclear.

        "Extracted Article": "Sierra Space, one of the sector's most valuable private companies, laid off several hundred employees and contractors this week, CNBC has learned. A Sierra Space spokesperson confirmed the company let go of about 165 employees on Thursday, but declined to specify the number of contractors affected. Former Sierra Space employees told CNBC that the layoffs included a significant number of contractors, with the cuts including hundreds of personnel in total. The laid-off employees received two weeks of paid non-working notice, plus four weeks of severance pay and health care benefits through the end of the year. Sierra Space had about 2,000 employees before reducing its workforce, the company spokesperson said. The Colorado-based company, which was recently valued at more than $5 billion, is pushing hard to fly the long-awaited first mission of its Dream Chaser spaceplane. Sierra Space this week shipped the first Dream Chaser, named Tenacity, for pre-launch testing at NASA's Armstrong facility in Ohio. The layoffs began soon after, the Sierra Space spokesperson said, noting the company conducted a surge in hiring this year to complete work on the Tenacity spacecraft. With Tenacity shipped, Sierra Space's spokesperson said the company is realigning to focus on the operations phase of Dream Chaser's first mission, as well as on classified national security work. The latter part of Sierra Space's realignment includes adding nearly 150 employees with security clearances from Sierra Nevada Corp., the aerospace and defense contractor owned by Fatih and Eren Ozmen , which the space company was spun out of two years ago. Sierra Space's spokesperson said the company is creating a national security space team to work on several classified contracts. Sierra Space also recently lost a pair of senior executives before the layoffs: COO Jeff Babione, who retired, and Senior Vice President of Space Destinations Neeraj Gupta. The company said the departures were unrelated. Two months ago, Sierra raised just under $300 million at a $5.3 billion valuation.

Dream Chaser has been in development for years with a goal to deliver cargo and eventually crew to low Earth orbit as a reusable vehicle. It resembles a miniaturized NASA Space Shuttle in appearance and is built to launch atop a traditional rocket and land on a runway like an airplane. The first Dream Chaser launch was previously scheduled for late last year, but delays in the development of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket pushed back that timeline. Dream Chaser is planned to launch on ULA's second Vulcan mission, with the first Vulcan launch targeting December . Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station.",

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon on Monday announced it will cut more than 180 jobs in its Amazon Games division, shutting down parts of the business that focus on streaming and supporting third-party games and putting more of an emphasis on developing its own titles, according to an internal company memo viewed by CNBC. The company will close its Game Growth and Crown Channel initiatives as part of the restructuring. Now, Amazon will focus on upcoming launches such as \\\"Throne and Liberty\\\" and \\\"Blue Protocol,\\\" as well as future initiatives such as \\\"Tomb Raider\\\" and \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\" games, Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, wrote in the memo to employees. \\\"I know this is difficult news and that the impact will be felt widely,\\\" Hartmann wrote. \\\"It never feels good to say goodbye to colleagues. This isn't a decision the leadership team came to quickly; it was the result of extensive considerations and road mapping for our future.\\\" Shares of Amazon closed down less than 1% Monday. The latest job cuts at Amazon come as CEO Andy Jassy has been in cost-cutting mode over the past year as the company has battled high interest rates and inflation. As a result, Amazon has carried out the largest layoffs in its history, cutting 27,000 jobs since last fall. The company also froze corporate hiring, and Jassy has looked to trim expenses in units across the company. In October, Amazon reported third-quarter earnings that suggested its cost cutting has been paying off. The company's revenue rose 13% to $143.1 billion in the third quarter, while net income more than tripled to $9.9 billion from $2.9 billion a year earlier. Hartmann wrote that after further evaluation of the Amazon Games business, the company decided it needed to focus its efforts and resources \\\"to deliver great games to players now and in the future,\\\" according to the memo. — CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report.

Splunk had nearly 8,000 employees as of January, according to its regulatory filings , meaning that around 500 employees will likely lose their jobs. The company laid off about 300 employees earlier this year . Splunk CEO Gary Steele said the firings \\\"are not a result of our agreement with Cisco\\\" in a letter to employees that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of the laid-off employees are located in the U.S., according to a concurrent filing with the SEC , and will receive unspecified severance and health-care packages. \\\"Within the next 24 hours, each ELT member will communicate with their organization to summarize any changes to their teams,\\\" Steele wrote. Splunk will incur about $42 million in restructuring costs, with most occurring before the end of April 2024. The company declined to comment on which teams would be affected or the timing of the layoffs shortly after the acquisition announcement, and referred CNBC back to its SEC filing. In September, Cisco announced it would acquire Splunk in an all-cash deal valued at $28 billion. The companies said the deal was expected to close by the third quarter of 2024. Shortly after the announcement, Steele and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the deal on a call with analysts. \\\"Together, we will become one of the largest software companies globally,\\\" Robbins told analysts.

An estimated 40 to 45 workers in Google News have lost their jobs, according to an Alphabet Workers Union spokesperson, who didn't know the exact number. A Google spokesperson confirmed the cuts but didn't provide a number, and said there are still hundreds of people working on the news product. \\\"We're deeply committed to a vibrant information ecosystem, and news is a part of that long-term investment,\\\" the spokesperson said. \\\"We've made some internal changes to streamline our organization. A small number of employees were impacted. We're supporting everyone with a transition period, outplacement services and severance as they look for new opportunities at Google and beyond.\\\" Google News presents links to articles from thousands of publishers and magazines. It's a popular tab for people who use Google search, allowing them to find top-ranked stories on a particular topic. The layoffs come amid a war between Israel and Hamas that has claimed thousands of lives in both Israel and Gaza since Oct. 7, and 20 months after Russia invaded Ukraine. Both wars have spawned a surge in the spread of misinformation across the web, heightening the importance of Google and other sites that users count on to find up-to-date news. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., on Tuesday asked for information on how Google; X, formerly known as Twitter; Meta ; and TikTok were trying to stop the spread of false and misleading content about the Israel-Hamas conflict on their platforms. European Union industry chief Thierry Breton demanded that companies, including Google, take stricter steps to battle disinformation as the conflict escalates. Breton specifically addressed letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, reminding them of the content moderation requirements under the EU's Digital Services Act. Google's spokesperson said, \\\"These internal changes have no impact on our misinformation and information quality work in News.\\\" Some tech companies said they've staffed up on content moderators as they scramble to battle misinformation. Meanwhile, Canada and other countries are eyeing laws that would force tech platforms to compensate publishers for their work. The cuts in Google News follow widespread layoffs across many parts of the company this year. In January, Google announced it was cutting 12,000 jobs, affecting roughly 6% of the full-time workforce. Last month, the company eliminated hundreds of positions from its recruiting organization. A staff engineer at Google News wrote a post on LinkedIn on Tuesday regarding the layoffs. \\\"These are some of the best and brightest people I've ever worked with,\\\" the person wrote. \\\"We're definitely worse off without them.\\\" WATCH: Google is the 'Magnificent Seven' stock that has the best catalyst Don't miss these CNBC PRO stories: This bank just hiked its 1-year CD rate to a fresh high A low-cost way to protect against an S & P 500 drawdown as risks escalate How to invest $1 million for the next decade, according to private bankers and wealth advisors This highly profitable industry is booming as the population ages Bank of America sees risks for employers as insurance coverage of weight loss drugs grows",

        "Extracted Article": "Supply chain software startup Flexport plans to cut approximately 20% of its global workforce as part of a new round of layoffs that's expected to begin on Friday, CNBC has learned. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen sent a note to staffers Thursday afternoon informing them of the job cuts, according to a copy of the memo viewed by CNBC. The company will inform employees of whether they're impacted or not via email beginning Friday morning, Petersen wrote. \\\"Today I have a difficult decision to share: We will reduce the size of our global team by approximately 20% with the process starting tomorrow, Friday, October 13,\\\" Petersen wrote. A Flexport spokesperson pointed CNBC to a company blog post from Petersen confirming the layoffs. The spokesperson declined to share Flexport's total headcount. The company employed approximately 3,500 people as of late September, according to Pitchbook data. The layoffs add to recent turmoil at the company since Petersen returned as CEO last month after abruptly ousting his hand-picked successor Dave Clark. Petersen claimed repeatedly that Clark, a 23-year veteran of Amazon , overspent and overhired during his tenure at Flexport. But documents viewed by CNBC, and sources close to Clark , showed that Petersen and members of Flexport's board helped implement decisions that Flexport has suggested were ill-advised. Since taking back the helm, Petersen quickly overhauled the company's top ranks, ousting several of Clark's key recruits, as well as its CFO and HR chief . He also rescinded 55 offer letters and moved to lease out unoccupied office space across the country. In the blog post, Petersen said following the cuts Flexport will be \\\"in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us to return to profitability as soon as the end of next year.\\\" The move will \\\"not impact the customer experience,\\\" Petersen added. He said the company is focused on the quality of its services like quote to invoice accuracy and shipment milestone accuracy. \\\"Today is a tough day, but we are a resilient, purpose-driven team that will overcome this setback and deliver on the promise of our mission of making global commerce so easy that there will be more of it,\\\" he said. Petersen wrote in the memo that employees in the U.S. and Canada are being directed to work from home on Friday unless they work out of a Flexport warehouse. Staffers based in Asia will be contacted about the layoffs on Monday, according to the memo. For U.S. employees, the company is offering nine weeks of severance, health care coverage through the end of the year, immigration support and job recruiting assistance, Petersen said in the memo. Staffers located outside of the U.S. will receive information about their separation packages at a later date.",

        "Extracted Article": "Singapore-headquartered food delivery service Foodpanda on Friday confirmed to CNBC that it is conducting its latest round of layoffs as the need to be \\\"more agile remains critical.\\\" \\\"Our company priority right now is to become leaner, more efficient and even more agile. To do this, we need to streamline our operations so we can take on a more structured approach for the coming days,\\\" Jakob Sebastian Angele, APAC CEO of Foodpanda, said on Thursday in a letter shared with employees seen by CNBC. He did not mention the number of employees impacted nor departments affected. This is Foodpanda's third round of layoffs since job cuts in February and September last year amid macroeconomic headwinds, according to media reports. Grab and Deliveroo have also reduced headcount this year. \\\"While we already implemented some measures earlier this year, there is more we have to do to create the right set-up for our operations,\\\" said Angele. Those measures include reviewing organizational structure across both regional and country teams as well as shifting some functional reporting lines into different leaders for more consistency and focus, said Angele. The layoffs come as Foodpanda parent Delivery Hero is in preliminary discussions with potential buyers to sell part of its Southeast Asian food delivery business, the Berlin-based company confirmed with CNBC. On Wednesday, German media outlet WirtschaftsWoche reported that Delivery Hero is selling its operations under the Foodpanda brand in Singapore, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Laos. \\\"Delivery Hero confirms negotiations with several parties regarding a potential sale of its foodpanda business in selected Southeast Asia markets. Any discussions or plans are in their preliminary stages,\\\" the firm told CNBC in an email, without mentioning specific markets. The German media report also said that competitor Grab could be a buyer. When CNBC reached out, Grab declined to comment on the matter. \\\"Grab's competitors whether Gojek or Foodpanda are losing market share. Grab is gaining market share in deliveries from Foodpanda who might even exit few markets in due course. Foodpanda is dis-advantaged due to its stand-alone delivery model,\\\" said Sachin Mittal, head of telecom, media and technology research at DBS Bank, in a Sept. 21 note. Grab is the leader in Southeast Asia's food delivery market, holding 54% of the region's gross merchandize value in 2022, while Foodpanda captured 19% and Gojek held 12%, according to a report from tech research firm Momentum Works. Tough operating environment Food delivery players are trying to stay afloat amid economic headwinds. Grab slashed costs in the past few quarters as the firm focused on profitability. Delivery Hero previously said that its \\\"focus remains on our long term commitment to building a sustainable, profitable business.\\\" Delivery Hero has yet to become profitable since its inception in 2011. For the first half of 2023, Delivery Hero reported a net loss of 832.3 million euros ($886.9 million), compared with a loss of 1.495 billion euros a year prior. Jonathan Woo, senior research analyst at Phillip Securities Research, said that Foodpanda potentially selling Southeast Asia businesses is \\\"typical market consolidation after intense competition, especially as scrutiny over profitability intensifies.\\\" \\\"Only a few market players — Grab, GoTo — in Southeast Asia could buy out Foodpanda,\\\" said Woo, adding that such an acquisition would be \\\"most appealing to Grab\\\" which is more entrenched in the region compared to GoTo or Deliveroo. GoTo is the combined company following a merger between Indonesia's Gojek, which operates ride-hailing and food delivery businesses, and e-commerce giant Tokopedia. In December 2021, Foodpanda announced it would scale down operations in Germany and exit the Japan market. Both Foodpanda and Grab have expanded to dine-in services as consumers resume their daily routines and go out and dine in more frequently.",

In a regulatory filin g Wednesday, the company said the cost-cutting measures aim to bring down its year-over-year operating expense growth rate. The company added that it expects adjusted third-quarter revenue of between $835 million and $875 million, up from a prior forecast of $815 million. In addition, Roku raised its third-quarter guidance for adjusted EBITDA to a range of negative $40 million to negative $20 million compared to a prior estimate of negative $50 million. Shares of the San Jose, California-based company closed about 3% higher Wednesday. The layoffs are part of an array of cost-cutting actions the company will take. Other actions include consolidating office space, slowing the pace of new hiring and reducing outside services expenses. Roku expects impairment and restructuring charges in the third quarter of up to $330 million, including a range of $160 million to $200 million related to office facilities, and $45 million to $65 million related to the job cuts. Moreover, Roku said it expects an impairment charge of $55 million to $65 million related to the removal of select existing licensed and produced content on its TV streaming platform, as part of a \\\"strategic review of its content portfolio.\\\" Roku anticipates the layoffs will be mostly complete by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter.

        "Extracted Article": "Niantic, a mobile games developer based in San Francisco, announced Thursday that it would lay off 230 employees as part of a reorganization. The privately held company will also cancel NBA All-World and stop production on a Marvel-based title that has not yet been released, according to a note from CEO John Hanke . It will also shutter a Los Angeles-based studio, where most of the affected employees are based. The move highlights how the mobile games industry has shifted in the years since Niantic landed its first major hit, Pokemon Go, in 2016. Since then, both Apple and Google' s app stores have introduced changes that prevent advertising tracking among apps, which has made advertising to gain new users more expensive and unpredictable. Hanke said the reorganization was due to both \\\"internal and external factors,\\\" including an overall global macroeconomic slowdown. \\\"In the years since Pokémon GO's launch, the mobile market has become crowded and changes to the app store and the mobile advertising landscape have made it increasingly hard to launch new mobile games at scale,\\\" Hanke wrote. Niantic said Thursday that supporting Pokemon Go is the company's \\\"top priority.\\\" Overall, App Store spending on games declined 5% in 2020 to $110 billion, according to an estimate from Data.ai, a research firm. The move also signals a shift in the landscape for augmented reality applications, which can integrate computer graphics and data into the real world. Pokemon Go can display a digital monster interacting with the real world through a phone's screen. But the technology is starting to be integrated into headsets or goggles that use powerful cameras to integrate the real and virtual worlds, which many in Silicon Valley see as the next major computing platform. Earlier this year, Meta released its Quest Pro headset and early next year, Apple will release its long-awaited Vision Pro headset . Hanke's letter says these new hardware products validate Niantic's strategy, but that it's only an \\\"intermediate stepping stone\\\" to true outdoor AR devices, which likely will resemble a lightweight pair of glasses with transparent displays. \\\"We believe that we can build key content and platform services that will help realize the promise of this technological shift,\\\" Hanke wrote. Still, Hanke wrote, the AR market is \\\"developing more slowly than anticipated, because of technology challenges and because larger players are slowing down their investments in light of the macro environment.\\\" Niantic had 1,050 employees as of 2022 and last raised $300 million at a post-money valuation of $9 billion in November 2021, when tech valuations were at their frothiest peak, as per Pitchbook .",

In an email to employees Tuesday, Chris Phillips, who oversees Google's maps division called Geo, said the company is shifting its Waze strategy to include Google ads rather than using a separate ads system. That move will result in layoffs, according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. \\\"We have decided to transition Waze's ads monetization to be managed by the Global Business Organization (GBO), similar to Google Maps,\\\" Phillips wrote. \\\"Unfortunately, this will result in a reduction of Waze Ads monetization-focused roles in sales, marketing, operations and analytics.\\\" The company hopes to \\\"create a more scalable and optimized Waze Ads product,\\\" Phillips wrote, adding that it will \\\"wind down the current Waze Ads product while we focus on building new Waze Ads powered by Google Ads.\\\" Phillips said the company would be notifying advertisers and partners of the change on Wednesday, and told employees that his team will answer questions and share its plans for next steps at \\\"our next Waze Town Hall\\\" on July 11. The email didn't say how many jobs would be eliminated. The Waze unit has more than 500 employees, according to internal documentation viewed by CNBC. Google acquired Waze for about $1.3 billion in 2013. Following a year of dramatically decelerating revenue growth, Google parent Alphabet announced in January that it was laying off 12,000 employees , or 6% of its workforce. The company has also eliminated some projects, downsized others and said it's focusing on becoming more efficient. Since December, Google has been consolidating Waze with its own Geo unit, which oversees maps. As a part of the shake-up, the company announced then-CEO Neha Parikh would be stepping down. The Waze app uses a crowdsourcing technique that allows it to determine the fastest driving route from one location to another, with the most recent traffic information. Waze has roughly 140 million active users. \\\"Decisions like these are incredibly difficult,\\\" Phillips wrote. \\\"Each one of these Wazers contributed to Waze's success and culture, and I want to express my gratitude and respect for what they have achieved.\\\" A Google spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and other details of Phillips' email in a statement and said the company \\\"remains deeply committed to growing Waze's unique brand, its beloved app and its thriving community of volunteers and users.\\\" WATCH: Any weakness in search will throw Google's long-term growth into question",

The move, confirmed to CNBC by a person familiar with the matter who preferred to remain anonymous because they were not able to speak publicly, will see the Chinese e-commerce giant offer severance packages to those affected. Alibaba has begun informing staff of the layoffs and is also helping them to move to different positions internally if they desire, the same source added.

Last week, the company announced plans for a full spin-off of its cloud computing unit and said it intends for the division to become an independent publicly listed company. Alibaba aims to complete the spin off within the next 12 months. Alibaba's CEO Daniel Zhang has long-seen cloud computing as a key part of the e-commerce giant's future but it currently accounts for just 9% of the group's total revenue. And revenue has been slowing significantly over the last few quarters. In fact, revenue fell 2% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year. Zhang said on the company's earnings call last week that this was \\\"partially due to our proactive move to adjust our revenue structure and focus on high-quality growth, and also a result of external changes in market environment and customer composition.\\\" TikTok owner ByteDance began moving its international operations off of Alibaba's cloud which continues to weigh on the company's cloud business. Still, Alibaba has made some headway with its cloud business over the past few years.

        "Extracted Article": "Money transfer group Zepz is laying off 420 employees, the company told CNBC exclusively, as the fintech sector grapples with a tough macroeconomic environment. The London-headquartered company began informing employees of the job cuts on Monday, with individual staff being told by their managers before larger communications were issued. By Tuesday, the whole company had been told about the move. Zepz, which owns the WorldRemit and Sendwave brands, has a total head count of around 1,600, meaning the cuts translate to about 26% of its workforce. The reductions will mainly impact Zepz's customer care and engineering teams as Zepz looks to shift those operations from multiple countries to more centralized hubs, the company said. The firm is headquartered in London but has regional offices in the United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Poland, Kenya and beyond. Zepz said it was implementing what it called \\\"workforce optimization\\\" to account for roles that had been duplicated following its combination of Sendwave with WorldRemit under one parent company. Collectively, both money transfer services are used by more than 11 million users across 150 countries. Sendwave was acquired by Zepz in 2020 for an undisclosed sum. It is the second time in just under a year that Zepz has laid off staff. In June 2022, Zepz implemented job cuts affecting around 5% of its workforce, according to Sky News . Mark Lenhard, Zepz's CEO, said the decision marked \\\"an important and necessary step in transitioning from two vast, segmented teams to one dynamic organization under Zepz, and laying ambitious foundations towards our long-term strategic direction as a portfolio business.\\\" He added that the company took the decision to reduce its head count due to a need to streamline its structure rather than macroeconomic pressures. \\\"Over the last year we have taken a serious look at how to optimize the organization to continue scaling in a mature fashion that sets up the business for long-term success,\\\" he said. \\\"The remittance industry has maintained robust growth despite global economic conditions, and we've seen this audience take great measures to ensure their loved ones are supported as costs rise around the world.\\\" Employees will be offered support in the form of counseling, coaching, career and CV development, job applications, and interviewing skills. Despite the job reduction measure, Zepz said it is still hiring for 200 roles. The company enables users to send money abroad from a smartphone or computer with people on the other end being able to receive it in their bank accounts, by cash, to a mobile wallet, or as a mobile airtime top-up. The service is a challenger to established money transfer services like Western Union, touting cheaper fees and the ability to move funds rapidly. A close rival is Wise , which claims to offer cheaper international money transfers than the banks. Fintechs like Zepz are facing a range of challenges including more cost-conscious consumers and heightened regulatory scrutiny. These have hit the value of various companies in the sector — both in the public and private markets. Funding has dried up and several fintechs have taken valuation cuts. Even legacy banks have struggled to gain traction in the market, with Goldman Sachs recently pulling back on its fintech ambitions . Zepz last raised cash in August 2021 at a $5 billion valuation when it announced $292 million of new funding from investors led by the hedge fund Farallon Capital. The startup is backed by leading venture capital firms including Leapfrog, TCV and Accel. \\\"Having hit profitability last year, the Zepz team has been focused on efficient growth and continuing to build a large, sustainable business,\\\" Harry Nelis, a partner at Accel, told CNBC. \\\"Following the acquisition of Sendwave a couple of years ago, the next stage in the integration of the two companies is to remove the duplication of roles across the brands' locations.\\\" \\\"The team's decision to optimise the workforce, while a difficult one, was important for the business's long-term growth and we're confident Zepz will continue to disrupt the industry,\\\" Nelis added. Zepz has long been a darling of the U.K. fintech scene. It was founded in 2010 by British-Somalian entrepreneur Ismail Ahmed, who started the company after moving to the U.K. after fleeing civil war-torn Somalia. Ahmed's idea for creating Zepz, then WorldRemit, stemmed from his own experience moving money across emerging markets; he would transfer funds to his family, who then lived in a refugee camp in Ethiopia, but the transfers were expensive and took months to complete. Ahmed stepped down as Zepz's CEO in 2018, though he remains on the board as nonexecutive chairman. His successor at the time was Breon Corcoran, an Irish businessman who formerly led British betting company Paddy Power Betfair. In 2022, Corcoran was replaced by Mark Lenhard, a former executive at bill payments firm Bill.com, whose appointment reportedly came as the prospects of an initial public offering for the company had waned. Lenhard said that Zepz \\\"never announced a timeline for IPO and are not planning to announce exit plans at this time.\\\" The company achieved operating profitability in the first half of 2022, he said, adding it is \\\"on a sustainable track to increase profit margins.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "DroneUp, a Walmart -backed startup competing alongside Amazon and others in the nascent drone delivery market, is cutting jobs across the company, CNBC has learned. The Virginia-based company began informing staffers of the layoffs Monday morning, according to two people who lost their jobs and asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Founded in 2016, DroneUp has a fleet of quadcopter-style drones that are designed to handle the last-mile portion of the delivery process, ferrying things like clothing, medication and food from warehouses to customers' doorsteps. The layoffs come as the tech industry continues to downsize and were part of the company's decision to focus more on its delivery hubs, a network of facilities for on-demand orders in the U.S. DroneUp is moving away from enterprise services like construction and real estate monitoring, aerial data capturing, and marketing, the ex-employees said. DroneUp confirmed the job cuts and the strategy change and said in an email that the layoffs hit \\\"a small percentage of the team,\\\" which now totals 418 people. \\\"After tremendous consumer adoption of our drone delivery services, we have made the decision to shift our business model to align our company structure around the continued growth and success of drone delivery and other drone services out of our Hubs,\\\" DroneUp CEO Tom Walker told CNBC in a statement. The company said that over the next six months, \\\"we will hire more people than were laid off.\\\" DroneUp is one of several startups racing to make drone delivery a reality. Within the past three years, DroneUp , Zipline and Flytrex have signed multiyear partnerships with Walmart to deliver lightweight goods by drone in as little as 30 minutes. At least 36 Walmart stores in the U.S. have the service, the company said in January. UPS , Amazon and Alphabet 's Wing unit are also in various stages of developing their own drone delivery services. Attempts at scaling commercial drone delivery in the U.S. have been slow moving, largely due to technical challenges and a lengthy regulatory approval process with the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency has authorized several companies to test drone deliveries in select markets as long as they don't pose significant safety risks. The economic downturn has also proven a setback for some drone delivery operators. Amazon in January laid off a significant number of employees from its Prime Air drone delivery unit just as the 10-year-old project prepared to begin flying packages to some customers in two small U.S. markets.

The news comes a week after a memo from new Lyft CEO David Risher confirmed that the company would trim its head count . Lyft shares closed up around 1.5% Thursday. The company has around 4,000 employees and had already implemented a 13% head count reduction in November 2022. Risher's tenure as CEO started earlier in April. He has emphasized a need to streamline operations and get back to \\\"better meeting the needs of riders and drivers\\\" in employee communications and public messaging. Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer remain on the company's board, having led the company through its 2019 public offering and subsequent expansion. The company's stock has never risen above its debut price and remains down around 8% year to date. A focus on efficiency has been a familiar refrain from tech executives.

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon will lay off 9,000 more employees in the coming weeks, CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff on Monday. The cuts are on top of the previously announced layoffs that began in November and extended into January. That round totaled more than 18,000 employees, and primarily affected staffers in its retail, devices, recruiting and human resources groups. Amazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs. It took into account the economy, as well as the \\\"uncertainty that exists in the near future,\\\" Jassy said. The company just wrapped up the second phase of its annual budgeting process, referred to internally as \\\"OP2.\\\" \\\"The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole,\\\" Jassy said. The latest round will primarily impact Amazon's cloud computing, human resources, advertising and Twitch livestreaming businesses, Jassy said in the memo. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy said approximately 400 people would be let go as part of Amazon's latest round of job cts. Clancy pointed to the economic downturn, and said Twitch's user and revenue growth hasn't \\\"kept pace with our expectations.\\\" Amazon is undergoing the largest layoffs in company history after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid pandemic . The company's global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Jassy is also taking on a broad overview of the company's expenses as it reckons with an economic downturn and slowing growth in its core retail business. Amazon froze hiring in its corporate workforce, axed some experimental projects and slowed warehouse expansion. While the company aims to operate leaner this year, Jassy said he remains optimistic about the company's \\\"largest businesses,\\\" retail and Amazon Web Services, as well as other, new divisions that continue to warrant investment. Amazon shares closed down 1% on Monday. Here's the full memo from Jassy: As we've just concluded the second phase of our operating plan (\\\"OP2\\\") this past week, I'm writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks—mostly in AWS, PXT, Advertising, and Twitch. This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term. Let me share some additional context. As part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole. As our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don't have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we've prioritized allocating more resources). Some may ask why we didn't announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we've made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support. If I go back to our tenet—being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole—I believe the result of this year's planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we're investing. To those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It's never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so. Andy",

Atlassian shares were up 1% in extended trading following the announcement. The technology industry has been contracting slightly in the past year after Covid caused individuals and companies to change their behaviors, even as unemployment continues to be low in developed countries . Atlassian's competitors Alphabet , Asana , GitLab , IBM , Microsoft and PagerDuty have also announced job cuts in recent months, with central bankers seeking to tamp down rising prices by lifting interest rates. Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian's co-founders and co-CEOs, said the move is less about financial needs and more about focusing on key priorities such as IT service management and helping customers move workloads from on-premises data centers to the cloud. Cuts are not evenly distributed across the company, they wrote in a blog post . The company generated about $873 million in revenue in the fourth quarter , up about 27% year over year, although it ended the period with a $205 million net loss. Australia's unemployment rate in January was 3.7%, according to government statistics . \\\"While many teams across Atlassian are impacted, some of our most impacted teams include Talent Acquisition, Program Management, and Research & Insights,\\\" Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes wrote. \\\"We want to be clear these decisions are not a reflection of our teammates' work. Every single person has made contributions that have changed our company for the better and will leave a lasting impact on their peers and teams. This is about rebalancing the roles we need across Atlassian first and foremost.\\\" Employees whom Atlassian is cutting will receive 15 weeks of severance, plus one week for each year of employment, and they can keep their laptops. Friday will be their last day, a spokesperson told CNBC. Atlassian is based in Sydney. Australia's unemployment rate in January was 3.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to government statistics . The cost cuts will result in $70 million to $75 million in charges, according to a filing. WATCH: Lay off the layoffs: When do investors demand growth?",

The CEO also said he plans to reduce his own salary for the coming fiscal year by 98%, and he is also forgoing his 2023 corporate bonus. \\\"As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today– and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions,\\\" Yuan wrote in the post.

        "Extracted Article": "German enterprise software firm SAP said Thursday that it will be cutting up to 3,000 jobs, or about 2.5% of its workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to announce significant layoffs. \\\"We are further focusing our portfolio in areas where we are strongest to continue our accelerated growth,\\\" said Christian Klein, CEO of SAP, during the company's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call. \\\"This led us to announce today that we intend to carry out a very targeted restructuring in select areas of the company that will impact up to 3,000 positions and include a headcount reduction of about 2.5%.\\\" SAP shares were trading over 2% lower at 8:05 a.m. London time following the announcement. Responding to a question on estimated cost savings from the layoffs, Luka Mucic, CFO of SAP, said the company expects \\\"about 300 to 350 million euros [$327 million-$382 million] in run rate savings.\\\" \\\"We are guiding [the company] to double-digit profit growth in 2023 as we had always committed, but there will be only a moderate help from the restructuring program to those results,\\\" Mucic told CNBC's \\\"Squawk Box Europe\\\" in an interview following the announcement. \\\"What this is really about is a very targeted effort to further streamline our portfolio and concentrate investments on the areas where we clearly can have the most positive impact,\\\" he added. It comes after the company reported positive fourth-quarter results during the call. \\\"Our cloud momentum accelerated in the fourth quarter with S\\u002F4HANA [SAP's enterprise resource planning software]. Cloud revenue is also accelerating once again and growing at 90%. We also returned to positive operating profit growth of 2%,\\\" said Klein. \\\"For the full year, we met our guidance across the board with our cloud revenue rising 24%, up five percentage points from 2021,\\\" he said. He added that the company achieved this despite exiting from Russia and the ongoing global macroeconomic volatilities. Last week, Klein suggested that the firm would avoid having to lay off workers, as it is \\\"in a very strong position ,\\\" in an interview with CNBC. He added that he was broadly optimistic about the outlook for technology despite challenges posed by higher interest rates and supply chain disruptions. \\\"We in the tech sector, we at SAP, we are very confident about the year ahead,\\\" Klein said at the time. SAP weighs Qualtrics stake sale During the Thursday earnings call, Klein also said SAP was going to explore the sale of its stake in Qualtrics as \\\"we focus on our core.\\\" SAP currently holds 71% of Qualtrics on an undiluted basis. In Nov. 2018, SAP acquired American business software provider Qualtrics for $8 billion. Qualtrics subsequently went public two years later. \\\"We have had a very successful collaboration on the go-to market and technology front with Qualtrics and we absolutely will continue this,\\\" said Mucic. \\\"The move is meant to set up SAP to be able to focus on the core ERP [enterprise resource planning] categories and the surrounding categories that come along with it, while giving Qualtrics an even better ability to independently pursue its leadership and pursue the corresponding investments,\\\" he said. He added that Qualtrics is \\\"a pristine and Premier cloud asset\\\" and SAP \\\"should be able to command a very positive valuation for shareholders, but that remains to be seen.\\\" \\\"This would materially increase the profit performance of SAP that is currently not reflected in the outlook,\\\" he added, without revealing further details. Qualtrics announced Wednesday fourth-quarter results and revenue guidance that exceeded analysts' forecasts.",

        "Extracted Article": "Cryptocurrency exchange Luno is the latest company in the industry to make layoffs, setting out to cut 35% of its global workforce. The London-based firm's CEO, Marcus Swanepoel, informed employees of the redundancies at 12 p.m. London time on Wednesday in a live-streamed town hall. \\\"2022 has been an incredibly tough year for the broader tech industry and in particular the crypto market,\\\" Swanepoel said in an internal memo which shared with CNBC Wednesday. \\\"Luno unfortunately hasn't been immune to this turbulence, which has affected our overall growth and revenue numbers.\\\" Luno has a total headcount of roughly 960, according to its LinkedIn profile, meaning that more than 330 jobs will be impacted. The cuts impact Luno's marketing teams in particular. A Luno spokesperson told CNBC the layoff measure would have \\\"minimal or no impact on key operating, and compliance teams.\\\" Luno, which has offices in Africa, southeast Asia and Europe, is part of the Digital Currency Group crypto conglomerate. The company will also be scaling back its U.S. and Australia operations, a company spokesperson told CNBC. DCG is one of several crypto firms caught up in the fallout from the collapse of FTX, formerly one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Genesis, the lending unit of DCG, filed for bankruptcy last week. Genesis' bankruptcy filing came after a standoff with one of its peers, Gemini, over a disputed lending agreement that generated rich returns for Gemini clients through Gemini's high-yield lending product, Gemini Earn. Gemini clients have $900 million stored on Gemini Earn. The service halted withdrawals after Genesis, which lent the funds out to large institutional borrowers, hit pause on client redemptions. The crypto industry has been mired in a downturn known as a \\\"crypto winter\\\" since the collapse in May last year of controversial algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve have also spooked market players. In the memo shared with employees Wednesday, Luno's Swanepoel said the industry had seen a \\\"series of shocks\\\" that led to a constrained funding environment and a shift toward long-term profitability. \\\"While we anticipated a downturn and proactively planned ahead with a business and funding model that can be resilient to some of these factors, the sheer scale and speed of all of this happening, and all at the same time, has put significant strain on our original plan,\\\" Swanepoel said. \\\"What this means in practice is that in addition to streamlining our strategy to focus on our core strengths, we need to also substantially decrease our cost base - which includes employee headcount in all of our markets - in order for us to be set up for success going forward.\\\" Roughly $2 trillion of value has been erased from the overall crypto market since the peak of the crypto boom in November 2021 — although bitcoin has had a bit of bounce since the start of the year. TerraUST's failure, coupled with deep declines in digital currency prices, sparked a cascade of further crypto failures, including Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, FTX, BlockFi and Genesis.",

        "Extracted Article": "Supply chain software startup Flexport is laying off 20% of its global workforce, or roughly 640 employees, according to a memo from co-CEOs Ryan Petersen and Dave Clark. Petersen started Flexport in 2013 because he figured there had to be a better way to manage the flow of goods that get put on cargo ships, planes, trucks and railroads and transported all over the world. The company's freight forwarding and brokerage services are in the cloud, enabling it to analyze costs, container efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions quickly and with more accuracy than legacy systems. The company topped last year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list , as supply chain bottlenecks roiled the global economy and it raised $900 million from investors at an $8 billion valuation. But now the co-CEOs say the company is being challenged as higher interest rates around the world hit demand. \\\"While we are looking forward to what's to come in 2023, we must also make hard decisions necessary to set us up for long-term success. We are overall in a good position, but are not immune to the macroeconomic downturn that has impacted businesses around the world. Our customers have been impacted by these challenging conditions, resulting in a reduction to our volume forecasts through 2023. Lower volumes, combined with improved efficiencies as a result of new organizational and operational structures, means we are overstaffed in a variety of roles across the company,\\\" they wrote. Last year, the company announced that Clark, the former worldwide consumer chief at Amazon, would take the helm as CEO of Flexport on Sept. 1, replacing Petersen, who plans to transition into the role of executive chairman this March. \\\"As the economy recovers, we will be ready to be the Flexport that we all want to be–the one stop for customers to make the movement of goods around the world easy. But to do that, we're going to need to be nimble, fiscally responsible and focused on building fast with operational excellence,\\\" the memo reads. The company said layoff packages will vary by geography, but for U.S. employees will include 12 weeks severance, 6 months extended health care, 2022 bonus payment, equity vesting acceleration including dropping the vesting cliff for those with 6 months or more of tenure, immigration support, and ability to opt into an alumni talent directory to help with future job opportunities. Flexport joins a long list of tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the Covid pandemic . Last week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs , more than the online retailer initially estimated last year, while Salesforce reduced its head count by more than 7,000, or 10%. Coinbase announced a 20% workforce reduction on Tuesday. Elon Musk slashed about half of Twitter's workforce after taking the helm as CEO last year, and Meta cut more than 11,000 jobs , or 13%.

        "Extracted Article": "Coinbase is cutting about a fifth of its workforce as it looks to preserve cash during the crypto market downturn. The exchange plans to cut 950 jobs, according to a blog post published Tuesday morning. Coinbase , which had roughly 4,700 employees as of the end of September, already slashed 18% of its workforce in June citing a need to manage costs and growing \\\"too quickly\\\" during the bull market. \\\"With perfect hindsight, looking back, we should have done more,\\\" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in a phone interview. \\\"The best you can do is react quickly once information becomes available, and that's what we're doing in this case.\\\" Coinbase said the move would result in new expenses of between $149 million and $163 million for the first quarter. The layoffs, along with other restructuring measures, will bring Coinbase's operating expenses down by 25% for the quarter ending in March, according to a new regulatory filing. The crypto company also said it expects adjusted EBITDA losses for the full year to be within a prior $500 million \\\"guardrail\\\" set last year. After looking at various stress tests for Coinbase's annual revenue, Armstrong said, \\\"it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario\\\" and there was \\\"no way\\\" to do so without reducing head count. The company will also be shutting down several projects with a \\\"lower probability of success.\\\" Cryptocurrency markets have been rocked in recent months following the collapse of one of the industry's biggest players, FTX. Armstrong pointed to that fallout, and increasing pressure on the sector thanks to \\\"unscrupulous actors in the industry\\\" referring to FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. \\\"The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,\\\" he said, adding there's likely more \\\"shoes to drop.\\\" \\\"We may not have seen the last of it — there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they're following the rules,\\\" Armstrong said. \\\"Long term that's a good thing. But short term, there's still a lot of market fear.\\\" Cryptocurrencies have suffered alongside technology stocks as investors flee riskier assets amid a broader economic downturn. Bitcoin is down 58% in the past year, while Coinbase shares are off by more than 83%. End of a growth era Coinbase joins a chorus of other tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the Covid pandemic . Last week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs , more than the online retailer initially estimated last year, while Salesforce reduced its head count by more than 7,000, or 10%. Elon Musk slashed about half of Twitter's workforce after taking the helm as CEO last year, and Meta cut more than 11,000 jobs , or 13%. Crypto companies Genesis, Gemini and Kraken have also reduced their workforces. \\\"Every company in Silicon Valley felt like we were just focused on growth, growth, growth, and people were almost using their headcount number as a symbol of how much progress they were making,\\\" Armstrong said. \\\"The focus now is on operational efficiency -- it's a healthy thing for the ecosystem and the industry to focus more on those things.\\\" Early last year, Coinbase had said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. Armstrong said he's now trying to shift the culture at Coinbase to \\\"get back to its start-up roots\\\" of smaller teams that can move quickly. Coinbase went public in April 2021 and has seen its share price plummet since. The stock is trading below $40 after surging as high as $429.54 on the day of its debut . Coinbase debt that's maturing in 2031 continues to trade at roughly 50 cents on the dollar. The company still had cash and equivalents of roughly $5 billion as of the end of September. Coinbase said it would email affected employees on their personal accounts, and revoke access to company systems. Armstrong acknowledged the latter \\\"feels sudden and harsh\\\" but \\\"it's the only prudent choice given our responsibility to protect customer information.\\\" Despite the industry's domino effect of bankruptcies and a marked drop in trading volume, Armstrong was steadfast in arguing that the industry isn't going away. He said the demise of FTX would ultimately benefit Coinbase, as its largest competitor is now wiped out. Regulatory clarity may also emerge, and Armstrong said it \\\"validates\\\" the company's decision of building and going public in the U.S. The CEO likened the current environment to the dot-com boom and bust. \\\"If you look at the internet era, the best companies got even stronger by having rigorous cost management,\\\" he said. \\\"That's what's going to happen here.\\\"",
        "Article Summary": "Coinbase is cutting about a fifth of its workforce as it looks to preserve cash during the crypto market downturn .<n>The exchange plans to cut 950 jobs, according to a blog post published Tuesday morning .<n>CEO Brian Armstrong said the move would result in new expenses of between $149 million and $163 million for the first quarter ."

Genesis had already laid off 20% of its workforce and last year replaced its CEO. Silbert's crypto conglomerate, which includes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and mining company Foundry, was hit by the market tumult of 2022 and the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. About 60 positions were eliminated, said the source, who asked not to be named because the numbers are confidential. The company now has around 145 employees. The latest reduction comes a day after interim CEO Derar Islim told clients that Genesis needed more time to solve its financial crisis. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the cuts. Genesis engaged bankruptcy professionals shortly after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research. The Wall Street Journal reported that Genesis had sought an emergency loan of $1 billion shortly after the implosion of Alameda, which was a major Genesis client. Genesis froze redemptions for all clients after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Silbert has come under fire as a result of the redemption freeze. Earlier this week, Cameron Winklevoss, a Genesis client and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, accused Silbert of engaging in \\\"bad faith\\\" stalling tactics and demanded a solution to the liquidity crisis at Genesis. He said DCG owes $1.675 billion to Gemini customers and other Genesis creditors. Silbert responded on Twitter by saying that DCG never borrowed $1.675 billion from Genesis and \\\"is current on all loans outstanding.\\\" Correction: An earlier version of this story has an incorrect number for total job cuts. It also mistakenly said Silbert was referring to Gemini instead of Genesis in the last paragraph. WATCH: Genesis suspends withdrawals",

        "Extracted Article": "Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake on Thursday told employees the company will be cutting 20% of its salaried workforce and she will reassume her post as CEO as the fledgling apparel company continues to grapple with low sales, a dwindling customer base and a reduced market cap. The brand's current CEO, Elizabeth Spaulding, who joined the company as president in 2020 and took over as CEO in August 2021 , will be stepping down effective immediately, Lake said. \\\"I will be stepping in as interim CEO and leading the search process for our next CEO,\\\" Lake said Thursday . \\\"Despite the challenging moment we are in right now, the board and I still deeply believe in the Stitch Fix business, mission and vision.\\\" Shares of the company surged roughly 9% Thursday after the announcements and its market cap hovered around $386 million. Shares closed more than 9% higher at $3.50. Stitch Fix, which sells curated boxes of clothing on a subscription basis, won big during the Covid pandemic after stuck-at-home consumers, newly flush with cash, took advantage of the service to update their wardrobes. But as shoppers ventured back out into the world, sales dropped and new strategies led by Spaulding failed . Shortly after taking over as CEO, Spaulding led the rollout of a direct-buy option, called Freestyle, that allowed customers to purchase items directly from the company with the hopes they'd be won over as regular subscribers. But the initiative stalled and in June, the company announced it'd be laying off about 15% of salaried workers, or about 330 people. The cuts left Stitch Fix with about 1,700 salaried employees, as of June. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData and a retail analyst, said in a statement Thursday that the company looks to have \\\"lost its way\\\" and that the issues it's facing are neither temporary nor immediately solvable. \\\"This is one of the reasons why the company has announced the termination of around 20% of its salaried positions – an action it hopes will help to stem losses and put the company on a better financial footing,\\\" Saunders said. Stitch Fix employees learned about the job cuts Thursday morning and were told the brand's Salt Lake City distribution center, which has been open for just over a year, will also be shuttering. Approximately 150 employees at that center will also be laid off, according to an employee at the facility. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about internal matters. Staff at the Utah distribution center, which opened three months after Freestyle was launched in December 2021, got the news during their all-hands monthly meeting on Thursday morning, the worker said. Staff were \\\"caught off guard\\\" and surprised to hear about the layoffs because the facility hadn't been open that long, the employee said. \\\"They did good in my opinion. We had [an] all hands right before work and [they] gave us a packet with all the info we needed from final dates to severance. They even had a translator for our Spanish speakers,\\\" the worker told CNBC, adding they felt \\\"overwhelmed\\\" by the news. When Stitch Fix shut down another distribution center in the past, some workers were given the option to relocate to different facilities within the company. It wasn't an option this time around for workers at the Salt Lake City center, the worker said. Salaried employees affected by the cuts will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, which increases with tenure, and health care and mental wellness support will continue through April 2023, Lake said. Lake told staffers she was \\\"truly sorry\\\" for the cuts and thanked them for their \\\"hard work\\\" and \\\"dedication.\\\" As founder, Lake has a unique perspective on the company and its potential, but she will have to contend with a consumer environment that has significantly shifted over the last year and a looming recession that'll see shoppers reduce their spending on discretionary items like new clothes.",

Juul said that in order for it to move forward and for operations to continue a \\\"reorganization\\\" of its global workforce will be necessary. The company plans to lay off about 400 people and cut its operating budget by 30% to 40%. Juul has faced financial strains in recent years. In 2015, it introduced its popular e-cigarette, touting it as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes. Since then, the company has been saddled by a variety of legal challenges. Juul settled several large cases brought by state authorities, largely related to its marketing practices, which many suits allege were deceptive and failed to warn about the risks of its products. The deal came ahead of a new report from the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said e-cigarettes — for the ninth consecutive year — were the most commonly used tobacco product among middle and high school students in 2022. Overall, nearly 3.1 million students used tobacco products this year, according to the agencies. More than 2.5 million used e-cigarettes. The report said many factors contribute to youth tobacco product use, including flavors, marketing and misperceptions of harm. The FDA ordered Juul to stop selling its vaping products this year and then placed a temporary hold on its order in July. The headwinds hurt the company's bottom line, and analysts predicted it might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a way out.",

        "Extracted Article": "Meta is laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees Wednesday. \\\"Today I'm sharing some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history,\\\" Zuckerberg said in the letter. \\\"I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.\\\" Shares of Meta were up about 7.7% Wednesday morning. The layoffs come amid a tough time for Facebook parent company Meta, which provided lukewarm guidance in late October for its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings that spooked investors and caused its shares to sink nearly 20%. Investors have been concerned about Meta's rising costs and expenses, which jumped 19% year over year in the third quarter to $22.1 billion. The company's overall sales declined 4% to $27.71 billion in the quarter while its operating income dropped 46% from the previous year to $5.66 billion. \\\"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted.\\\" Zuckerberg said. He said Meta is making reductions in every organization but that recruiting will be disproportionately affected since the company plans to hire fewer people in 2023. The company extended its hiring freeze through the first quarter with a few exceptions, Zuckerberg said. \\\"This is a sad moment, and there's no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you've put into this place,\\\" he added. Impacted employees will receive 16 weeks of pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, Zuckerberg said. Meta will cover health insurance for six months. Meta is heavily investing in the metaverse, which generally refers to a yet-to-be developed digital world that can be accessed by virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. This hefty bet has cost Meta $9.4 billion so far in 2022, and the company anticipates that losses \\\"will grow significantly year-over-year.\\\" Zuckerberg said during a call with analysts as part of its third-quarter earnings report that Meta plans to \\\"focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas\\\" during the next year. \\\"That means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,\\\" Zuckerberg said. \\\"In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.\\\" Meta counts more than 87,000 employees as of the end of September. Here's Mark Zuckerberg's letter to employees: \\\"Today I'm sharing some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history. I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1. I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted. How did we get here? At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that. In this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We've shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas — like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We've cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We're restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won't bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I've also made the hard decision to let people go. How will this work? There is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this. Everyone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions. Some of the details in the US include: Severance . We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap. PTO . We'll pay for all remaining PTO time. RSU vesting . Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting. Health insurance . We'll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months. Career services . We'll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads. Immigration support . I know this is especially difficult if you're here on a visa. There's a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need. Outside the US, support will be similar, and we'll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws. We made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we're keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell. While we're making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we're planning to hire fewer people next year. We're also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days. The teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I'm grateful for it. I'm sure you'll go on to do great work at other places. What other changes are we making? I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we're transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We'll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months. We're also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I'm going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently. I'm currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we're focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less. Fundamentally, we're making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we're operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs. How do we move forward? This is a sad moment, and there's no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you've put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I'm grateful for your contributions. To those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we've worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we're making these decisions to make sure our future is strong. I believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing. Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we're leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I'm confident that if we work efficiently, we'll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever. We'll share more on how we'll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I'll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you've done to advance our mission.

        "Extracted Article": "Hard drive maker Seagate Technology said Wednesday it plans to cut 8% of its global workforce, or about 3,000 employees, citing economic uncertainty and declining demand for its parts. \\\"In addition to adjusting our production output, to drive supply discipline and pricing stability, we are implementing a restructuring plan to sustainably lower costs, including reduction in our global workforce,\\\" Seagate CEO Dave Mosley said on a call with analysts. The restructuring plan was announced after Seagate reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings per share. The company's shares fell more than 7% during trading Wednesday and are down over 55% so far in 2022. Mosley added that Seagate's customers, which include cloud providers, have a buildup of parts inventory because they are spending less on computers. He said he doesn't expect Seagate's customers to finish using up their parts backlogs in the current quarter. The company will maintain paying a dividend, Mosley said. Seagate makes hard drives and other parts often used in PCs and cloud servers. Seagate's layoffs are the latest sign that demand for PCs and cloud servers is deteriorating after two boom years driven by the coronavirus pandemic . On Tuesday, Microsoft , which makes the operating system for most PCs, reported that Windows licensing sales dropped 15% on an annual basis . Microsoft's cloud business also came up short versus expectations. Seagate said that its restructuring plan, which includes the layoffs, would save the company about $110 million per year and would be completed by the end of the company's March quarter. It said it expected to pay pretax charges of about $65 million, mostly for severance and other termination benefits. Seagate reported adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of 48 cents per share on Wednesday, significantly below FactSet consensus expectations of 71 cents per share. Seagate's revenue was $2.04 billion, which also came in under the FactSet consensus of $2.1 billion. Seagate said it expected $1.85 billion in revenue in the current quarter, below FactSet expectations of $2.12 billion.",

        "Extracted Article": "A Microsoft spokesperson on Monday confirmed that the company let go of additional workers as the software maker's revenue is expected to slow, thanks to weaker sales of Windows licenses for PCs. The move aligns with efforts at technology companies big and small to lower costs. Meta Platforms and Salesforce are among those in Silicon Valley that have slowed their pace of hiring this year, even as Coinbase , Netflix and others have resorted to layoffs . \\\"Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly,\\\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC. \\\"We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead.\\\" Monday's announcement comes three months after Microsoft said it trimmed less than 1% of employees. In July, Microsoft called for about 10% revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter, slower than it's been in more than five years. The company will be announcing earnings on Oct. 25. Axios , which reported the layoffs earlier on Monday, said the cuts impacted fewer than 1,000 people and cited an unnamed person.

        "Extracted Article": "Beyond Meat plans to cut 19% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, the company said Friday in a regulatory filing. The cuts are expected to be completed by the end of the year and are an effort to achieve cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023. In August, the company announced it was trimming its workforce by 4%. Shares of the company fell nearly 10% Friday, dragging the company's market value below $900 million. The stock was already down about 78% so far coming into the trading day, as the plant-based food maker struggles with declining sales. Shares earlier this week notched a 52-week low of $12.76 per share. The announcement came as the company also revealed its chief operating officer, Doug Ramsey, left the company weeks after he was arrested for allegedly biting a man's nose and punching a Subaru in an Arkansas parking garage. As part of the job cuts, the role of chief growth officer has been eliminated and Deanna Jurgens, who held that role, will leave the company. The company also said Chief Financial Officer Philip Hardin stepped down from his post earlier this week. Hardin will leave the company after a roughly two-week transition period to pursue another opportunity, according to the filing. Lubi Kutua, previously Beyond Meat's vice president for financial planning and analysis as well as investor relations, assumed the top financial role on Thursday. Beyond Meat did not immediately return a request for comment on the changes.",

        "Extracted Article": "About a year ago, online retailer Packable was preparing to go public through a special purpose acquisition company. With the SPAC market having evaporated and the economy now sputtering, Packable is laying off staff and preparing to liquidate, according to internal documents reviewed by CNBC. Packable is the parent company of Pharmapacks, an online seller of health, personal care and beauty products. Pharmapacks was founded in 2010 as a single brick-and-mortar pharmacy in the Bronx, New York, before it turned to the internet and established a big home on Amazon . Last September, Pharmapacks was the No. 1 Amazon seller in the U.S., though it now ranks fifth among the site's top sellers nationwide, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse . Packable said in a notice to employees Monday that it was laying off 138 people, or roughly 20% of its staff, with the remaining 372 employees expected to be terminated as \\\"individual winddown responsibilities are completed.\\\" The memo was signed by Leanna Bautista, the company's chief people officer. Packable failed to secure new financing that would have enabled it to stay in business, the notice said. \\\"We diligently pursued internal and external financing options but were ultimately unsuccessful,\\\" the company said. \\\"Given the company has no viable financing alternatives, we are now forced to cease operations, liquidate any remaining collateral, and shut down the business, including the facility you report to.\\\" Packable previously secured funding from high-profile investors, including Carlyle Group , Fidelity and Lugard Road Capital. In addition to Amazon, the company sells products on marketplaces run by Walmart , eBay and Target . As of 2020, Amazon was by far Packable's largest channel, accounting for 80% of sales, according to an investor presentation. Amazon's third-party marketplace has become the centerpiece of its dominant e-commerce business, as it now accounts for more than half of online retail sales. Because of Amazon's global reach and massive customer base, many retailers count on the company for the majority, and in some cases the entirety, of their business. Packable's last year has been fraught with turbulence. After announcing in September plans to merge with a SPAC — Highland Transcend Partners I Corp. — in a deal that valued the company at $1.55 billion, the market started to turn and investors lost their appetite for SPACs. In March, Packable called off the deal to take the company public, citing \\\"unfavorable market conditions,\\\" just days before Highland Transcend's shareholders were scheduled to meet. Packable CEO Andrew Vagenas quietly resigned in April, and was succeeded by Daniel Myers, according to the company's website . Myers, a former supply chain executive at Mondelez, was named to Packable's board last year. Vagenas still sits on the company's board, according to his LinkedIn . Not a single SPAC was issued in July as what remained of the market dried up completely, according to CNBC calculations of SPAC Research data. A boom in 2020 and 2021 created more than 600 SPACs hunting for targets. For Packable, the disappearance of capital represented a dramatic turn for a business that boomed after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. With consumers stuck at home, online spending surged, and investors poured into the space. Revenue slowed last year from double-digit growth in 2020 as the company struggled to navigate supply-chain constraints, which \\\"resulted in significant inventory out of stock, purchase order delays, and delays in onboarding new customers,\\\" according to an investor presentation. However, the business was still able to grow some through the early part of 2022. In February, Packable said its average daily revenue in January increased to an estimated $1.6 million from $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Representatives from Packable didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. WATCH: What's behind the hype in the Amazon aggregator space",

        "Extracted Article": "Peloton told employees Friday that it is slashing roughly 780 jobs, closing a significant number of its retail stores and hiking prices on some equipment in a bid to cut costs and become profitable. The company did not specify how many of its 86 retail locations it plans to shutter, but said an \\\"aggressive\\\" reduction will begin in 2023. The pace of closures will depend on how quickly Peloton can negotiate getting out of leases. Peloton said it will exit last-mile logistics by closing its remaining warehouses and shift delivery work to third-party providers, resulting in a portion of the job cuts. It is also cutting a number of positions in its in-house support team, which are mainly located in Tempe, Arizona, and Plano, Texas, and instead will rely on third parties. The sweeping changes are part of recently installed Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy's plan to steer the connected fitness equipment maker in a new direction. Peloton's business boomed to unthinkable highs after the onset of the Covid pandemic, sending shares surging alongside other so-called stay-at-home stocks like Zoom . But under then-CEO and Peloton founder John Foley, demand began to slow almost as quickly as it shot up, as people started going out again. McCarthy's biggest tasks now include getting rid of fixed costs and finding more ways to cash in on its loyal base of customers. \\\"The shift of our final mile delivery to 3PLs will reduce our per-product delivery costs by up to 50% and will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in the most cost-efficient way possible,\\\" McCarthy wrote in a memo to employees seen by CNBC. \\\"These expanded partnerships mean we can ensure we have the ability to scale up and down as volume fluctuates,\\\" he added. Peloton, which had just lowered the prices for its products earlier this year , is raising the price of its Bike+ by $500 to $2,495 in the United States. The price of its Tread machine is going up by $800 to $3,495. The price of Peloton's original Bike and its strength-training product known as Guide will remain unchanged. McCarthy acknowledged the about-face on pricing, saying that the equipment price reductions made sense for the company back in April, as Peloton tried to get rid of inventory quickly. Investors sent Peloton shares up 13.6% on Friday. The stock has tumbled more than 60% so far this year, with the company's share price hitting an all-time low of $8.22 in mid-July. Shares had traded as high as $120.62 apiece roughly a year ago. Under McCarthy, who took the reins from Foley in February, the business has focused on ways to grow subscription revenue over hardware sales. Earlier this year, for example, Peloton raised the price of its all-access subscription plan in the United States to $44 per month from $39. In July, Peloton had also announced it would stop all its in-house manufacturing and instead expand its relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer Rexon Industrial. That resulted in about 570 job cuts. The company also suspended operations at its Tonic Fitness facility, which it acquired in 2019, through the remainder of the year. When McCarthy became CEO , Peloton announced it was slashing roughly $800 million in annual costs. That included cutting 2,800 jobs, or about 20% of corporate positions. The company also said it would be walking away from plans to build a sprawling production facility in Ohio. CNBC reported in January , ahead of Foley stepping down, that Peloton planned to temporarily halt production of its equipment, according to internal documents detailing those plans, as a way to control costs with demand dropping. Foley's missteps included making long-term bets on Peloton's supply chain during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic that would later prove to be a drag on its business as sales of its Bikes and Tread machines slowed. Peloton's losses in the three-month period ended March 31 widened to $757.1 million from $8.6 million a year earlier. Revenue dropped to $964.3 million from $1.26 billion. The company ended the quarter with 2.96 million connected fitness subscribers, which are people who own one of the company's products and pay for a membership to its live and on-demand workout classes. \\\"We have to make our revenues stop shrinking and start growing again,\\\" McCarthy, a former Spotify and Netflix executive, said in Friday's memo. \\\"Cash is oxygen. Oxygen is life.\\\" McCarthy said the company is continuing to hire in certain areas, including software and engineering. \\\"I share this so you won't think we're driving with our foot on the gas and the brake at the same time,\\\" he said. McCarthy is also asking all of Peloton's office-based employees to return to the office three days per week starting on Sept. 6. As of Nov. 14, that will be considered mandatory, he said. Peloton is expected to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on August 25. Read the full memo that Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy sent to employees on Friday: Team – I'm writing to update all of you on Peloton's ongoing transformation. The past few months we've made considerable progress on our journey. We continue to define and lead the global Connected Fitness category, even as we work to make Peloton more efficient, cost effective, innovative, and to best position ourselves for the future. Thank you for your hard work. We have a clear strategy to drive the long-term, sustainable future of this company. Job one is generating free cash flow by right-sizing our inventory commitments and converting many of our fixed costs to variable costs because that cost structure better aligns with the seasonal revenue of the business. Second, we are also focused on innovation across our hardware and software to strengthen our Member experience. And, finally, we're focused on growth and expanding the ways consumers can experience the magic of Peloton. We are making several additional changes to the business to improve our performance. Maintaining Our Premium Brand Positioning For several months we've been running the business to maximize cash flow. In April, we lowered prices on our original Bike, Bike+ and Tread to make the entry point for new Members more accessible and to accelerate the sale of inventory to generate much needed cash flow. At the time, we were still in the early days of our $800 million restructuring plan. We were under considerable cash flow pressure, and we were in the process of (but had not yet completed) securing a $750 million bank loan. Because of our success managing our inventory and supply chain issues, and because of the bank financing, we have the opportunity to adopt a more nuanced pricing strategy targeting \\\"value\\\" and Premium Members alike by increasing prices on our Bike+ and Tread models – which contain distinctive, superior design elements, while keeping the price of Bike v1 and Guide the same. Specifically, in the U.S., our new price structure will be as follows: Bike+ will increase by $500 to $2,495 Tread will increase by $800 to $3,495 This pricing change achieves three objectives – we maintain an attractive entry point for new Members; we continue to sell down excess Bike v1 inventory, creating a financial tailwind on investments already made; and we maintain our position as the undisputed premium brand in the Connected Fitness category. Optimizing our Operations and Workforce We continue to make strategic changes to our operations and workforce. Following last month's exit from owned-manufacturing in Taiwan, we are now restructuring our final mile delivery capabilities by expanding our work with our third party logistics (3PLs) providers. As a result, we are eliminating our North American Field Ops warehouses, resulting in a significant reduction in our delivery workforce teams. Unfortunately, this means a number of team members will be departing the company. We know changes of this nature are never easy. The shift of our final mile delivery to 3PLs will reduce our per-product delivery costs by up to 50% and will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in the most cost-efficient way possible. I also want to highlight that we have been actively working with our 3PLs to dramatically improve the Member experience, and we are seeing positive momentum in those CSAT scores. This has been a challenge. We won't fix it overnight, but we have no choice but to make it work, so we're leaning into it and proactively managing our 3PL relationships. We are confident in the plan we've put in place and we're encouraged by the progress we're making. After re-examining the resources required to provide our Members best-in-class support, we have also decided to reduce fixed costs by eliminating a significant number of roles on the in-house North America Member Support Team. In-bound Member support volume has been lower than forecasted, and like other parts of the business, we are going to expand our work with our third party partners. These expanded partnerships mean we can ensure we have the ability to scale up and down as volume fluctuates while still continuing to provide the level of service our Members have come to expect. These are hard choices because we are impacting people's lives. These changes are essential if Peloton is ever going to become cash flow positive. Cash is oxygen. Oxygen is life. We simply must become self-sustaining on a cash flow basis. I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those delivery team and Member Support colleagues who have been impacted by this decision. Investing in Talent to Innovate and Grow In the past you have heard me say we cannot cost cut our way to success. We have to make our revenues stop shrinking and start growing again. We do that with investments in marketing and R & D to drive innovative products. We must also develop new features and functionality for existing CF platforms that delight Members and drive word-of-mouth which drives organic growth. And, we double-down on our existing strengths, particularly our world-class, Instructor-led content that motivates and inspires Members daily. While we're reducing our workforce in certain areas of the business, we continue to fill roles on key teams to drive the business forward. This includes further commitment to recruiting top talent in key areas of need such as our software engineering team. I share this so you won't think we're driving with our foot on the gas and the brake at the same time. Success is about making the right investments to drive growth while managing to a cost structure the business can afford. I've also long-believed hands-on, shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration is essential for fast, efficient teamwork and innovation. To that end, we'll be asking all office-based employees to return to their office three days per week starting on Tuesday, September 6th. We know some of you will need more time to sort out related details, and we are asking that you do so, working with your manager, with a deadline of Monday, November 14th for all of us to be back in the office (if your PeloTeam designation is office-based) every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. You also are welcome to come in more often, if you'd like, and take full advantage of the office amenities and gym. As of November 14th, return to office for office-based workers (not you if you were hired to be remote) will be mandatory. There are many successful businesses, like Airbnb and Spotify, who have chosen to operate remotely. There are also many successful companies who have opted to collaborate in the office in person, like Nike and Google. The culture you choose to work in should be compatible with your personal preference. For those of you who don't want to return to the office, we respect your choice. We hope you choose to stay, but we understand not everyone will. Balancing e-Commerce and Retail Lastly, we need to rebalance our e-Commerce and retail mix to drive efficiencies, which means we will reduce our retail presence across North America. This decision will result in a significant and aggressive reduction of Peloton's retail footprint. Data tells us that in the post-COVID economy, consumers want a mix of virtual and in-person engagement with the brands they love, meaning a hybrid model of e-commerce as well as limited physical retail touchpoints. We have to meet our prospective Members where they are. We will provide future updates on which retail operations will be impacted by this decision in the coming months. We do not anticipate closing retail locations in calendar 2022, but the timing is uncertain as we begin negotiations to exit our store leases. Forward Focused In closing, I want to reiterate that I know some of this news is difficult to hear as it has a real impact on people's lives who believe in the mission and our ability to manage the business for success. Today's news reminds us it was never more important that we be successful in managing our turnaround. That's the reason we're making the hard choices to shift our cost structure from fixed to variable and to right size our spending in retail stores. As we face economic uncertainty in the global macroeconomic outlook, we will continue to analyze our workforce and expenditures. Change is constant, and we need to embrace it and make it one of our super powers. Overall, I continue to be optimistic about the future of Peloton. That doesn't mean there won't be challenges ahead. There will be, and there will be unforeseen setbacks. That's the nature of turnarounds. But I'm confident we can overcome the challenges because we've come so far in just the last four months, which feeds my optimism about our ability to engineer our long-term success. No one's gonna give it to us, least of all our competitors. We're going to have to step up and make it happen. The future of connected fitness is Peloton's to own. Me to you. You to me. You to each other. And all of us to our Members. -Barry",

        "Extracted Article": "Shares of Sweetgreen fell after the salad chain lowered its 2022 forecast. The restaurant company also said it laid off 5% of its support center workforce and will downsize to a smaller office building to lower its operating expenses. Shares in the company fell more than 20% in after-hours trading following the earnings report Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the stock was down about 4% amid a broader market rally. As of Tuesday's close, Sweetgreen's stock has fallen about 47% this year to $16.85. It reached a high of $56.20 shortly after its IPO in November. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Loss per share: 36 cents, in line with estimates Revenue: $124.9 million vs. $130.2 million expected Sweetgreen sales softened around Memorial Day, leading the company to revise its forecast lower, CFO Mitch Reback said in a statement. On the company's conference call, executives attributed the slowdown to a number of factors, including \\\"unprecedented levels of summer travel,\\\" a slow return to the office and another wave of new Covid-19 cases. In the quarter, ended June 26, Sweetgreen's net sales rose 45% to $124.9 million. Its same-store sales climbed 16%, boosted by 6% menu price hikes. For the year, Sweetgreen now expects annual revenue of $480 million to $500 million, down from its prior forecast of $515 million to $535 million. The chain also revised its outlook for same-store sales, predicting growth of 13% to 19%, down from the previous projection of 20% to 26%. \\\"We think that it's a conservative estimate, but looking back, we've just been wrong on so many of these calls,\\\" Reback said on the call. Moreover, Sweetgreen also changed its outlook for adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to a range of $45 million to $35 million, wider than its previous range of $40 million to $33 million. But the chain explained the steps it's taking to achieve profitability, including layoffs and reducing its real estate footprint by moving to a smaller office. Severance packages and related benefits are expected to cost the company between $500,000 to $800,000, while the office move will cost $8.4 million to $9.9 million. The charges are expected to impact its third-quarter results. Sweetgreen reported a second-quarter net loss of $40 million, or 36 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $26 million, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier. The company blamed an increase in stock-based compensation for its increasing losses. Read the full earnings report here.

Tonal, which sells wall-mounted workout devices for $3,495, experienced rampant growth in 2020 and 2021 as consumers were stuck at home and seeking ways to break a sweat. Tonal's brand awareness also exploded as it tapped star athletes such as LeBron James and Williams to appear in its commercials. It has raked in $450 million in funding, to date, and at one point in 2021 was valued at as much as $1.6 billion . But for now, Tonal is tapping the brakes. It joins a list of businesses – including competitor Peloton – that are reducing head count in order to trim expenses and readjust to new levels of consumer demand for their products. Businesses are simultaneously grappling with red-hot inflation on everything from raw materials to fuel to workers' salaries, and many are preparing for an economic slowdown, even if a recession isn't certain. \\\"As we head into a recession — and many of us believe we're headed into a recession — it's really important that we become a business that's here for the long term,\\\" Orady said in an interview. \\\"What we're doing is effectively going from a hypergrowth business ... to more of a sustained-growth business.\\\" Tonal didn't disclose exactly how much money it plans to save through the layoffs. It also didn't say if its valuation has been adjusted in the private markets. \\\"The public markets are no longer rewarding hypergrowth when it comes at the expense of profitability. And as such, private market investors are no longer investing as many dollars or as aggressively to support businesses through hypergrowth,\\\" Orady said. \\\"Those dollars just aren't out there the way they were a year ago.\\\" Investors are increasingly shying away from money-losing entities, he said. It shows in the stocks of some of the publicly traded companies that fit this bill. Shares of Peloton, for example, hit a fresh all-time low Wednesday of $8.66, having dropped more than 70% year to date. Peloton's losses in the three-month period ended March 31 widened to $757.1 from a loss of $8.6 million a year earlier. Allbirds , a shoemaker that has booked losses since going public last year, has watched its stock price tumble more than 65% this year. Shares of eyeglasses retailer Warby Parker , which went public via a direct listing in 2021 and is also losing money, are down more than 70% year to date. Orady said Tonal is focused on cutting customer acquisition costs, and it will do that in part by scaling back on advertising. He said he attributes any slowdown in sales in the past 90 days to Tonal pulling back on marketing, but overall demand has remained steady. The company also recently hiked the price of its equipment by $500, to $3,495 from $2,995. All of Tonal's employees who are impacted by the job cuts will receive a minimum of eight weeks of continued pay, the company said, as well as health-care benefits through the end of September. Tonal also said in its memo to workers that it is offering extended equity vesting for all employees to become shareholders, including accelerated stock option vesting and an extension on the window of time that option holders have to exercise their stock options for up to four years.",
        "Article Summary": "Tonal, the connected fitness equipment maker, is cutting 35% of its workforce .<n>The company employs about 750 people today, compared with a little more than 110 before the Covid-19 pandemic .<n>The job cuts will put the company on track to make money in a matter of months, CEO Aly Orady said ."

        "Extracted Article": "Microsoft said Tuesday it cut a small number of workers, days after the software maker began its 2023 fiscal year, a time when the company normally announces structural changes. Technology companies big and small have slowed hiring plans or announced reductions in the workforce in recent months to withstand a possible economic recession , which central bankers have been trying to ward off by raising interest rates. That shift has made investors less interested in growth-oriented stocks such as Microsoft, whose shares have declined about 22% since the start of the year, while the larger S & P 500 index is down 19% over the same period. The cuts reach a variety of groups and affect less than 1% of the company, which employed 181,000 people as of June 2021, the company said. \\\"Today we notified a small number of employees that their roles have been eliminated,\\\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. \\\"This was a result of a strategic realignment, and, like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis. We continue to invest in certain areas and grow headcount in the year ahead.\\\" Bloomberg reported on the move earlier. The Microsoft executive in charge of Office productivity software, Rajesh Jha, in May told his team to obtain permission before opening new roles. In June, Microsoft slashed its income and revenue guidance , citing unfavorable foreign-exchange rates. On Monday technology industry research group Gartner estimated that PC shipments, a factor affecting Microsoft's Windows operating system business, fell nearly 13% in the third quarter, the most sluggish performance in nine years, in part because of geopolitical issues. Microsoft last announced a round of layoffs in 2017, after the start of its new fiscal year. The company trimmed thousands of employees as it adjusted its approach to selling . Facebook parent Meta Platforms decreased its target for adding software engineers this year from 10,000 to around 6,000 to 7,000, Reuters reported last week. Amazon's retail division decreased its 2022 hiring goal as well, Insider reported in May. WATCH: Microsoft says it's open to working with unions",

        "Extracted Article": "UiPath will reduce roughly 5% of its total workforce as part of a restructuring plan, according to a new SEC filing . The company, a provider of software for automating office tasks, said that it had 4,200 employees as of April 30, 2022. Most of the layoffs are expected to occur by the end of July. UiPath's board approved the decision to reduce headcount, citing the need to increase profits, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said. The software provider estimates that it will spend $15 million as part of the plan, mainly to pay for employee severance and compensation benefits. A spokesperson told CNBC that UiPath's layoffs are not related to market conditions. \\\"In the context of ongoing business prioritization, UiPath is undertaking a restructuring action that will primarily focus on the effectiveness of our go-to-market organization,\\\" the spokesperson said, noting that the company believes the cuts will help it simplify its go-to-market approach and lead to higher sales productivity and better market segmentation. Shares of UiPath were off about 1% in midday trading on Monday and are down about 49% year to date. But shares are up about 23% for the month after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on June 1 that exceeded prior guidance and raised the outlook for the following quarter. \\\"This is about continuing to drive sustained, profitable growth. We want to thank our departing team members — we appreciate their incredible talent and contributions in support of UiPath and our mission,\\\" the spokesperson added. The software provider has more than 45 offices across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. \\\"The announcement signals PATH's increasing focus on profitability amid growing investor scrutiny on tech stocks with limited profitability & FCF,\\\" Cowen analysts said in a note to investors on Monday. \\\"It had signaled its commitment to its longer-term 20% adj EBIT target and this news reflects the first major changes put into place post its recent senior management appointments (new Co-CEO and chief business officer).\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Coinbase is laying off almost a fifth of its workforce amid a collapse in its stock and crypto prices . The cryptocurrency exchange will cut 18% of full-time jobs , according to an email sent to employees Tuesday morning. Coinbase has roughly 5,000 full-time workers, translating to a head count reduction of around 1,100 people. Shares of Coinbase closed down .83%. CEO Brian Armstrong pointed to a possible recession, and a need to manage Coinbase's burn rate and increase efficiency. He also said the company grew \\\"too quickly\\\" during a bull market. \\\"We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,\\\" Armstrong said in the email, adding that past crypto winters have resulted in a significant decline in trading activity. \\\"While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.\\\" Coinbase had initially said it was pausing hiring. Two weeks later, the crypto giant announced that it was extending the freeze for the \\\"foreseeable future.\\\" Earlier this year, Coinbase said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. \\\"Our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market,\\\" Armstrong said. \\\"While we tried our best to get this just right, in this case it is now clear to me that we over-hired.\\\" The news comes during a deep rout for Coinbase shares. The stock went public via a direct listing last April during a boom in crypto markets and investors clamoring for high-growth tech stocks. Coinbase's shares are down 79% this year and 85% from the all-time high. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped to near $22,000 and has lost 53% of its value this year. San Francisco-based Coinbase reported a slump in users in its last quarter and a 27% decline in revenue from a year ago. The company gets the majority of its top line from transaction fees, which are closely tied to trading activity. President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi called it a \\\"very difficult decision for Coinbase\\\" but given the economic backdrop, she said it \\\"felt like the most prudent thing to do right now.\\\" Affected employees received a notification from human resources. If so, the memo was sent to a personal email as Coinbase cut off access to the company systems. Armstrong called it the \\\"only practical choice\\\" given the number of employees with access to customer information, and a way to \\\"ensure not even a single person made a rash decision that harmed the business or themselves.\\\" Coinbase employees will have access to a talent hub to find new jobs in the industry, including Coinbase Ventures' portfolio companies. Choi said Coinbase would still be \\\"doubling down\\\" on areas like security and compliance and may be \\\"reorienting\\\" employees to near-term revenue drivers. \\\"If there are any cuts to new product areas, it's going to be more around experimental venture areas that we're still very bullish on, but that we don't want to invest in in this part of the cycle,\\\" Choi told CNBC in an interview at the company's headquarters. \\\"We will continue to invest in incredible innovative areas of crypto that we think are emerging over the longer term, but we're probably going to do those in a more measured way in this type of an environment.\\\" Coinbase joins dozens of other tech and crypto companies slamming the brakes on hiring. Crypto lender BlockFi said Monday it was cutting 20% of its employees . Open-source tracker Layoffs.fyi estimates that more than 5,500 start-up and tech jobs have been cut in June alone. Coinbase's intention is \\\"that this is a one-time event,\\\" Choi said adding that the company has $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company has lived through multiple bear markets in crypto before, also known as \\\"crypto winters.\\\" \\\"We will power through any macro environment, any crypto winter, or anything that's coming,\\\" she said. \\\"The reality though, is that we have to adjust when we feel that there's a very dynamic economic environment in play.\\\" Tech companies have been fighting low morale and attrition as their stocks get slammed. Last week, a petition posted to a decentralized publishing platform called for the removal and a \\\"vote of no confidence\\\" regarding several Coinbase executives, including Choi. Armstrong called attention to the since-deleted petition, and in a Tweet urged employees to quit if they don't believe in the company. \\\"We will always encourage our employees to share feedback internally on how we operate as a company — and we have a number of mechanisms in place for them to do so. It's very much unclear if this document came from within the company,\\\" Choi said. \\\"However, if it did, we're disappointed that those behind it felt the need to breach the trust of the company and their co-workers by sharing this information in a way clearly designed to drive controversy rather than a meaningful dialogue.\\\" Coinbase has no plans to offer additional company equity grants, or cash compensation amid the price drop, Choi said. The company offers annual grants, partially so employees could \\\"mitigate the swings\\\" and volatility in crypto. For employees and investors, the COO likened it to Amazon or Tesla : a long-term investment with volatility in the meantime. \\\"We think that anyone who makes an investment, whether they're an employee or investor, will have a handsome return over the longer term,\\\" Choi said. \\\"Coinbase is a long-term play — we have very deep conviction in the long-term value of the stock.\\\"",

        "Extracted Article": "Stitch Fix said Thursday that it is laying off 15% of salaried positions within its workforce, mostly in corporate roles and styling leadership positions, in a bid to trim expenses amid red hot inflation and waning consumer demand for certain items. CNBC was first to report on the layoffs, which the company confirmed Thursday afternoon as it reported its financial results for the three-month period ended April 30. Stitch Fix said it expects to save between $40 million to $60 million in fiscal year 2023 with the job cuts and other changes. It also anticipates incurring restructuring and other one-time charges of roughly $15 million to $20 million, which will be recognized in its upcoming fourth quarter. The company also offered up a disappointing forecast for its fiscal fourth quarter, calling for revenue to be between $485 million and $495 million, which would represent as much as a 15% drop from prior-year levels. Stitch Fix shares tumbled nearly 11% Thursday, closing the day at $7.78. They fell again Friday. The stock traded as high as $68.15 a year ago. The job cuts come as the online styling service has been grappling with higher expenses on everything from its supply chain to marketing to labor, and it has also been struggling to onboard new users. \\\"We've taken a renewed look at our business and what is required to build our future,\\\" Stitch Fix CEO Elizabeth Spaulding said in a memo to employees. \\\"While this was an incredibly difficult decision, it was one needed to make to position ourselves for profitable growth.\\\" The roughly 330 people were notified of the cuts on Thursday morning, the memo said. That number represents about 4% of the company's overall workforce. The cutbacks at Stitch Fix fit into a broader trend shaping up within the U.S. labor market , as pandemic darlings such as Peloton , Netflix and Wayfair become more conservative with their hiring, but airlines, restaurants and hospitality chains still struggle to fill roles. The layoffs come three months after Stitch Fix cut its revenue guidance for the year and withdrew its earnings forecast. Spaulding said the company's active client count was not where she wanted it to be. As of April 30, Stitch Fix counted 3.9 million customers, a 5% drop from the prior year. Stitch Fix's business is entirely online and that was seen as a bright spot during earlier stages of the Covid pandemic, as spending shifted online. More recently, its rollout of a direct-buy option known as Freestyle didn't go as well as the company had hoped for. And more and more shoppers are shifting back to spending their money in stores as pandemic restrictions lift. Stitch Fix reported a net loss for its fiscal third quarter of $78 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with a loss of $18.8 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 8% to $492.9 million from $535.6 million a year earlier. \\\"We know we still have work to do,\\\" Spaulding said in a press release. Stitch Fix's market cap has fallen below $1 billion, as the stock has declined about 58% this year.",

CEO Vlad Tenev made the announcement in a blog post on Tuesday afternoon. Shares fell more than 5% in extended trading. The move will affect about 9% of full-time employees. Robinhood reported 3,800 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. The company declined to give more detail on the exact number of employees being let go. \\\"We determined that making these reductions to Robinhood's staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers,\\\" Tenev wrote. \\\"While the decision to undertake this action wasn't easy, it is a deliberate step to ensure we are able to continue delivering on our strategic goals and furthering our mission to democratize finance,\\\" he added. Robinhood is scheduled to release its first-quarter results after the bell on Thursday. The blog post didn't mention those financial results other than saying that the company has more than $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. The company previously reported having $6.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of December. Going forward, the company will review employee growth plans and \\\"continue to prioritize internal opportunities for automation and operational efficiency,\\\" Tenev wrote. Robinhood rose to prominence in early 2021 as a key player in the GameStop saga , where retail investors bid up so-called meme stocks. The brokerage saw a surge of new customers and cash, and entered the public markets through an IPO in July . However, the stock gained little traction and has traded below its IPO price of $38 per share for much of its existence. Shares closed at $10 on Tuesday. The company shed monthly active users during the fourth quarter , and its first-quarter results will face tough comparisons to the GameStop mania of the first quarter of 2021.",

Update: Marketing and creative teams were impacted by the layoffs, according to posts on LinkedIn. Expedia had 16,500 employees across nearly 50 countries, as of Dec. 31, according to Expedia’s annual 10-K filing. That’s slightly down from its total employment of 17,100 at the end of 2023. About half of its workforce are in tech-related roles. Last year Expedia cut about 1,500 roles, primarily in its Product &amp; Technology division, as part of an operational review. Expedia reported revenue growth of 10% to $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, while adjusted net income grew 30% year-over-year. Both beat analyst expectations.

Its market capitalization is more than $25 billion. Expedia Group includes brands such as vrbo, Orbitz, Hotwire, Trivago, and Hotels.com in addition to the flagship Expedia.com.

Founded in 2014, Textio uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help remove bias from workplace language for hiring and performance feedback.

The company said workplaces are ramping up coaching and performance management support for managers, and Textio is investing in its ability to build and deliver on those customer needs. It will be opening up some new roles, including in sales and product marketing. Textio has raised $42.5 million from investors including Industry Ventures; Operator Collective; Emergence Capital; Scale Venture Partners; Cowboy Ventures; Bloomberg Beta; and Upside Partnership.

        "Extracted Article": "Pandion, a Bellevue, Wash.-based delivery startup that launched during the pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom, has become the latest company to fall victim to the subsequent venture capital crunch and a return to normalcy in online retail. The company informed employees Friday afternoon that it’s shutting down immediately, after talks with potential acquirers proved unsuccessful. Employees will be paid through Jan. 15, without severance. Pandion employed 63 people. As a result of discontinuing operations, the company’s headquarters in Bellevue will close, as will its five sortation centers, in Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia. The company was started in 2020 by former Amazon and Walmart executive Scott Ruffin, the founder and former leader of Amazon Air. It came out of stealth mode in February 2021. Pandion most recently raised a $41.5 million Series B round in March 2024, led by Revolution Growth, a Washington, D.C., venture capital firm. Bloomberg reported at the time that sales were on track to reach $220 million in 2024. In a memo Friday afternoon to Pandion employees, obtained by GeekWire, Ruffin apologized and took personal responsibility for the sudden shutdown, saying they deserved more notice and a better outcome. The company had enough cash for operations through the end of 2024, he wrote. After spending the last month in discussions with potential acquirers, including ongoing talks through the holidays, the company was close to a deal several times, but ultimately concluded that a sale wasn’t possible. “This is not how any of us were hoping or planning for this to end,” Ruffin wrote. He added later that the company “entered the market at a challenging time, and we needed more runway to scale, but the shift in funding availability and the US small parcel market has limited our chance to continue to grow.” A Pandion-branded delivery van, in an image distributed by the company in 2021. (Pandion Photo) The closure is part of a broader wave of challenges across the logistics and delivery industry, including the collapse of Convoy in October 2023, and cutbacks at companies including Flexe, Uber Freight, Flexport, and others. Pandion picked up packages at fulfillment centers operated by retailers, routed packages through its sortation centers, then used a network of more than 1 million delivery drivers to deliver items to their final destination. Those drivers were employed by staffing agencies, and many of them are expected to be assigned to different clients. The company’s competitors included UPS, FedEx, Amazon and others. It was #75 in the most recent ranking of the GeekWire 200 list of the Pacific Northwest’s fastest-growing startups. Pandion raised about $125 million in equity over the last five years. With the shutdown, investors are not expected to receive a return. Other investors in the company included Playground Global, Prologis Ventures, Bow Capital, Telstra Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Schematic Ventures, Proof, and Sentinel Global. Although the company wasn’t able to make an M&amp;A deal, its technology represents an asset that could still be interesting to a potential acquirer. That includes a universal label technology for flexible deliveries, and machine leaning technology that optimizes logistics for better on-time delivery rates at lower prices. Here is the text of the memo from Ruffin to employees: As we discussed in our last All Hands, we had runway through 2024 Q4 based on our last funding rounds. As many of you know, the leadership team and I have been speaking with many investors and several potential acquirers. We have spent the last month in daily discussions with these parties, including through the holidays. We have been very close to a deal several times. However, it has become clear to me and the board that those conversations have run their course without a favorable outcome. Due to our legal obligations to our lenders, our Board of Directors and I have decided that we must immediately shut down the company. Today is Pandion’s last day as an operating business. We’ve already cancelled inbound packages and will have no further pickups. For the minimal packages remaining at our facilities, we’ll have one last simplified dispatch to the postal service. As part of this process, Pandion will complete an assignment for the benefit of creditors. As a result, Wednesday, January 15, is everyone’s final day as an employee of Pandion. Your last paycheck through January 15 will arrive that day. Because we owe more than we have in the bank, we cannot provide a severance payment, even though you deserve more notice and a better outcome. I’m sorry. I take full responsibility for the series of decisions that led to this situation. I care about you, and [I] apologize this is the outcome. This is not how any of us were hoping or planning for this to end. What each of you have built is unquestionably amazing and will leave its mark on the industry well beyond our years. I believe in my heart of hearts that the power of markets and timing can serve as either a massive tailwind propelling the business forward or a massive headwind preventing a talented team like each of you from reaching ultimate success. In our case, we entered the market at a challenging time, and we needed more runway to scale, but the shift in funding availability and the US small parcel market has limited our chance to continue to grow. Effective Wednesday, I am no longer an employee of Pandion. My mission has now changed from Founder and CEO to a personal coach and mentor to any of you who desire help in your professional transition. I, and many others on the leadership team, are available to personally assist each and every one of you in finding your next roles. The People team will be reaching out to each of you on next steps. I wish this final All Hands could have been under much different circumstances, but I will always retain the pride and admiration for all that we built together.",

According to a statement from Zillow to GeekWire, the cuts impacted roles on reorganized agent software and advertising teams: “As part of our ongoing commitment to working with our agent customers to offer a digitized and integrated experience to more movers in more markets, we are focused on the long-term growth of the products and business solutions we offer to agents. We feel as confident as ever about this strategy, and we continue to prioritize investment in the areas that will most benefit our agent customers. “This week we’ve made some changes to the organizational structure of several agent software and advertising teams, resulting in the elimination of certain roles. We are grateful to the impacted employees for their contributions to Zillow and are ensuring their transition is as smooth as possible. While decisions like these are never easy and never our first choice, we believe responsibly managing our resources has positioned our teams well to deliver for consumers, agent customers and the broader real estate industry in 2025.” The move comes at the same time that Seattle-based real estate competitor Redfin made another round of job cuts, laying off 46 employees. A Redfin spokesperson said those reductions affected primarily managers in headquarters, program, and field leadership roles. Amid a tough real estate market, mortgage rates reached 6.93% this week, the highest level since July. Home listings are up, but partly due to unsold homes sitting on the market, Redfin reported. In one bright spot for buyers, affordability didn’t get worse in 2024. Zillow reported revenue of $581 million and adjusted earnings of $127 million during third quarter earnings in November. In August, Zillow named longtime executive Jeremy Wacksman as new CEO, taking over from co-founder Rich Barton.",

The layoffs affected longtime employees and senior sales leaders, according to posts about the cuts on LinkedIn. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We’ll update this story if we hear back. The layoffs came as a surprise and were conducted over a short video call last week, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email sent to affected employees, obtained independently by GeekWire, the company wrote: “As discussed in our meeting this morning, in an effort to right-size and optimize RealSelf for the future, the company has made the difficult decision to restructure our team, effectively immediately.” RealSelf has less than 100 employees, according to LinkedIn. The company, founded in 2006, operates a Yelp-like marketplace that helps people learn more about cosmetic procedures including botox, facelift, liposuction and more. There are patient reviews and photos, treatment costs and ratings, and thousands of verified doctors on its platform. RealSelf previously cut staff in 2022, 2020, and 2019. The company named Minou Clark as its new CEO in July. Clark was previously a senior vice president at 11:11 Media, a media company founded by Paris Hilton, and held leadership roles at Yahoo, Dotdash Meredith, and Popsugar. In a LinkedIn post announcing her new role, Clark referenced an “upcoming brand refresh” that “represents the best parts of our legacy and will carry us into this next chapter as we grow.” “Think thumb-stopping social content, personalized newsletters, a dynamic website, doctor recommendations you can trust, honest af user reviews, booking on-site (I know, I know, this should already be a thing), transformation videos, brand activations, loyalty programs and more,” Clark wrote. “We have so many tricks up our sleeves.” Clark recently posted about an open role at RealSelf. The company has four open positions. RealSelf last month hired former Peachy exec Ende Li as its new chief financial officer. Clark and Li are based in New York City, according to LinkedIn. The company’s former CFO, Jim Nida, served as interim CEO from December 2023 to July, according to LinkedIn. RealSelf founder and former CEO Tom Seery remains executive chairman of the company. We reached out to Seery for comment. In 2021, RealSelf acquired Tajmeeli.com and the YNS group. The company said it transitioned to remote-first in 2020.",

        "Extracted Article": "OfferUp, the Seattle-area company behind a popular used goods marketplace, is cutting 22% of its headcount in a bid to remain profitable as it looks to expand into new product lines. In a memo to staff, which you can read in full below, OfferUp CEO Todd Dunlap cited macroeconomic trends such as programmatic ad rates that affected some of the company’s revenue lines. “While we still have plenty of cash on our balance sheet, it’s important in these times to remain profitable,” he wrote. The company did not disclose the number of employees affected by the layoffs. OfferUp has nearly 500 employees, according to LinkedIn. Affected employees will receive severance and health benefits through the end of February. The company is providing career transition and job placement services. Founded in 2011, OfferUp competes against Craigslist, eBay, Facebook and other marketplaces where users buy and sell goods. The company says it facilitates 30 million transactions on its platform annually and is currently ranked No. 3 on the GeekWire 200, our index of Pacific Northwest startups. It generates revenue in part by charging sellers for premium features and broader reach. OfferUp has been planting seeds to expand beyond used goods and into “local commerce” areas such as job postings, events, home services, and more. “To be clear, finding great deals on goods and autos in your local community will remain the core of OfferUp,” Dunlap wrote in the memo. “But we have clear signal that the simple, trusted, and safe approach that has made us successful in goods and autos can be extended into additional local offerings, and that those extensions will create a better experience and better value for our users.” Layoffs hit the tech industry hard during 2022 and 2023 amid higher interest rates and more cautious spending. More than 260,000 tech employees were laid off last year, and nearly 150,000 were cut this year so far, according to Layoffs.fyi. Dunlap, a former exec at Xbox and Booking.com, took over for OfferUp founder and former CEO Nick Huzar in 2021. Huzar is now leading a secretive new EV charging startup, Juicer Energy. Read Dunlap’s memo to staff below. ——————— OfferUp Team, I’m reaching out today with some difficult news. After careful consideration, we have made the decision to reorganize our team to better align with our goals and strategy for 2025 and beyond. Unfortunately, as part of that reorganization, we will be reducing the size of our team. OfferUp managers and our People team just finished meeting with our colleagues who will be leaving, so I wanted to touch base with the rest of you to provide some context for the changes. First and foremost, I want to thank our departing colleagues. Many of them are strong contributors who made a big impact on OfferUp and its users. In most cases, they were in roles that we determined weren’t necessary for our future plans, and while I wish our growth was sufficient to create new roles for them, that is not currently the case. We know they will have a similarly positive impact in their next roles and wish them the best. It is important that we treat those leaving fairly and in accordance with our values. We are providing our departing colleagues with the following: Severance – The holidays are a difficult time for this transition, so we will be providing severance in an amount equivalent to their salary through the end of February. They will also be receiving the same holiday bonus as our remaining employees. Healthcare – We will cover the full cost of COBRA coverage through February 2025. Outplacement Services – Our departing colleagues will have access to career services through a company that provides career transition and job placement services. Laptops – We are allowing everyone to keep their OfferUp-issued computers at no cost. For most of those impacted, today is their last day at OfferUp. A few selected employees have agreed to stay on to help transition over the next few months. In all cases, I personally appreciate the dedication and professionalism demonstrated by our departing colleagues, and I ask you all to join me in thanking them. With respect to the reorganization and strategy, we’ll discuss the specifics in more detail in the all-team meeting tomorrow. I don’t want to go into too much detail today because today is a day of adjustment, and I want to provide you all with a bit of time before we start focusing on the future. That said, I will provide some high-level insight into the go-forward plan so that you’re not left wondering. We’ve talked over the last several months about our ongoing transition from a C2C local items marketplace to a comprehensive mobile platform for classifieds and local connection. We’ve tested a few steps into this evolved concept for OfferUp, and the results are very encouraging. To be clear, finding great deals on goods and autos in your local community will remain the core of OfferUp. But we have clear signal that the simple, trusted, and safe approach that has made us successful in goods and autos can be extended into additional local offerings, and that those extensions will create a better experience and better value for our users. With the launch of Jobs, Services, Real Estate Rentals, Local Events, Community, and the other local connections experiences, we’re showing there is demand for the OfferUp approach to “local” in many areas. I’ve also been blown away by the response of local merchants to the OfferUp Business offering that we added last year. The numerous positive testimonials from our local merchant customers about the success they see on OfferUp demonstrates the huge impact we can have on the people and organizations that help our communities thrive. I really want to lean in on these opportunities to evolve OfferUp. To do so, we need to ensure (1) that we will have sufficient resources for the investment, and (2) that we can do so responsibly and profitably. While 2023 was a great year for OfferUp and we saw revenue growth and our first year of EBITDA profitability, in 2024, the macroeconomic impact on some of our legacy revenue lines, particularly the impact of programmatic ad rates, has caused us to slip slightly back into the red. While we still have plenty of cash on our balance sheet, it’s important in these times to remain profitable. It’s also important to invest in spreading our story to more users, and I want to put more resources toward user growth and brand awareness. However, I want to invest prudently and profitably, and the restructured organization will allow us to do so. In short, we want to provide more reasons for our users to come back to OfferUp more often, we want to be a force that strengthens and connects our local communities, and we want to invest in making sure more users know how OfferUp can help them in their everyday lives. I look forward to sharing more with you tomorrow about how our new structure will allow us to achieve those goals. Todd",

Founded in 2014, Outreach has more than 6,000 customers including Zoom, Twilio, and McKesson. It aims to help companies improve their seller workflows and win more deals. Outreach competes with other sales engagement companies including Salesloft, Apollo, and Clari. Tech giants such as Microsoft and Salesforce offer their own products aimed at streamlining and automating sales processes. The impact of the generative AI boom is a big topic in the sales automation sector. Outreach has raised nearly $500 million and reached a $4.4 billion valuation after raising $200 million in 2021. It is ranked No. 1 on the the GeekWire 200 list of privately-held tech companies in the Pacific Northwest. Outreach co-founder and former CEO Manny Medina stepped down in September.

        "Extracted Article": "F5 continued its practice of trimming its workforce after the completion of its fiscal year, confirming Tuesday that it has made job cuts impacting roles across several teams inside the company. The workforce reduction amounts to less than 2% of the company’s global workforce, a spokesperson for the Seattle-based application security and delivery company told GeekWire via email. F5 employs about 6,500 people, according to previous SEC filings, which means that the cuts impacted more than 100 positions. “These changes are a part of a broader effort to align resources to our highest priority areas and ensure we are best positioned to meet the continually evolving needs of our customers and our business,” the spokesperson said. F5’s fiscal year ended Sept. 30. The company on Monday reported quarterly revenue of $747 million, up 6% year-over-year, and GAAP net income of $165 million, up more than 8% year-over-year. While generally growing its headcount overall, the company has made similar layoffs in the past, following its annual review of its business and operations. Previous examples include layoffs November 2023, October 2022, fall 2021 and fall 2019, according to previous GeekWire reporting and the company’s regulatory filings. The company’s CEO, François Locoh-Donou, paused layoffs in 2020 at the height of the pandemic. SEND US A TIP Do you have information about this story?

More recently, F5 laid off a smaller number of employees working on marketing-related content production, saying it was shifting marketing resources to rely more heavily on agencies for creative and content needs. The difficult tech job market means many people across the industry are spending months looking for work. F5 did not provide further details about the latest round of layoffs this week. Employee posts on LinkedIn and messages to GeekWire indicate that teams were impacted in areas including technology services, sales, customer support, and process management. Reporting its financial results this week, the company said its board authorized an additional $1 billion for its common stock repurchase program. The company’s stock is up more than 20% this year. F5 also appointed Cooper Werner as its new chief financial officer and executive vice president.

It also cut 10% of its workforce in a separate round of layoffs last year. Amperity had around 400 employees at the beginning of this year. Jones cited the latest cuts to broader industry headwinds. “These challenges are not unique to Amperity,” he said. “The current economic climate is affecting the entire enterprise software industry. Both software vendors and their customers are facing similar economic pressures and having to make the necessary adjustments to navigate these market conditions.” Layoffs hit the tech industry hard during 2022 and 2023 as venture capital dollars dried up and customers became more cautious of spending. More than 260,000 tech employees were laid off last year, and more than 136,000 were cut this year so far, according to Layoffs.fyi. Founded in 2016, Amperity’s software lets companies fine-tune their targeted marketing campaigns by connecting fragmented data sources about individual customer habits via emails, purchase history, mobile app usage, website traffic, physical store visits, and more. The startup earned “unicorn” status in July 2021, reaching a $1 billion valuation after raising $100 million. Jones took over from former CEO Barry Padgett earlier this year. Padgett became CEO in 2022, following the sudden departure of co-founder Kabir Shahani, who said he left voluntarily for personal reasons. Shahani also resigned from the company’s board. Last month the company hired Chris Polishuk as its chief revenue officer.",

Posts on LinkedIn from impacted employees show the cuts affecting employees in product and program management roles. “Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners.” Microsoft’s fiscal year 2024 ended June 30.

Last month Microsoft cut around 1,000 jobs across the company, in areas including its Azure cloud unit and HoloLens mixed-reality organization. Microsoft laid off nearly 2,000 employees in January in its gaming unit, three months after the tech giant completed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company’s largest acquisition ever. The cutbacks come as Microsoft tries to maintain its profit margins amid heavier capital spending, which is designed to provide the cloud infrastructure needed to train and deploy the models that power AI applications. Microsoft’s headcount surged during the pandemic but has leveled off in the past two years. The company employed about 227,000 people worldwide at the end of the 2023 calendar year, down from 232,000 a year earlier, according to numbers tracked by GeekWire based on regulatory filings and earnings calls. More than 100,000 tech workers have been laid off so far this year, according to Layoffs.fyi. Last year, companies laid off more than 260,000 employees.

        "Extracted Article": "Insurance giant Prudential is shutting down Assurance IQ, five years after spending $2.35 billion to acquire the under-the-radar tech startup based in the Seattle region. “As we look to the future, we believe that directly investing in our core businesses and capabilities will help us become a higher growth, more capital efficient company,” Caroline Feeney, head of Prudential’s U.S. businesses, wrote in an email to employees obtained by GeekWire. “After a careful review of our businesses and strategic initiatives, we have made the difficult decision to wind down our Assurance business.” Prudential noted in its first quarter earnings report on Tuesday that it “decided to exit” the Assurance business. The company confirmed the shutdown in a statement to GeekWire. Assurance uses technology to match consumers with insurance plans that are purchased online or through an agent. Its acquisition to Prudential was one of the largest in Seattle tech history, and the largest insurance tech exit in history, according to Financial Technology Partners. The startup, founded in 2016 by Michael Rowell and Michael Paulus, never raised any outside capital and quietly reached unicorn status as a $1 billion company. At the time of the deal, Prudential said Assurance’s “rapid-growth model offers compelling economic advantages with low fixed costs and low capital requirements that produce high margins and high degree of scalability.” “Assurance accelerates the strategy and growth potential of Prudential’s financial wellness businesses, bringing us closer to more people across the entire socio-economic spectrum to better serve the full picture of their needs,” Prudential CEO Charles Lowrey said in 2019. But just a few years later there were signs of trouble. A story by The Wall Street Journal in 2022, “How Prudential’s Big Tech Bet Went Sour,” cited missed financial targets and government inquiries over regulatory matters. Many insurance technology companies struggled amid the broader tech downturn that started in 2022. Prudential stopped reporting Assurance financial data in January 2023, in part because “its financial results and operations are not considered significant,” the company said at the time. Assurance reported adjusted operating income of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to a net operating loss of $10 million a year prior. Prudential took goodwill impairment charges, used when a company’s value decreases following an acquisition, of $177 million, $903 million and $1.06 billion in the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Assurance had around 1,700 employees as of December 2022 and now has 1,000 employees, in addition to contract workers who help customers find insurance plans. Update: A filing with the Washington state Employment Security Department shows 112 workers in Seattle being laid off, starting July 3. In an email to employees on Tuesday, Assurance CEO Allison Arzeno wrote that “I realize this news comes as a shock and creates uncertainty.” She said a majority of the company’s employees will be laid off. “Together, we built something special here,” wrote Arzeno, who took over as CEO in 2020. “Our work made a difference. We helped hundreds of thousands of people navigate complex insurance tradeoffs and secure coverage that improved and protected their personal and financial well-being.” Prudential reported first quarter net income of $1.1 billion, down from $1.46 billion in the year-ago period. Asked about M&amp;A deals on the company’s earnings call with analysts Wednesday, Lowrey said Prudential “anticipated a different outcome when we purchased Assurance.” “As we look forward we will focus on acquisitions of more established businesses that present opportunities to expand our capabilities and scale in our existing market-leading businesses,” he said. The company’s stock is up nearly 30% in the past 12 months. It has a market capitalization above $39 billion. Read the full memo from Feeney below. “As we look to the future, we believe that directly investing in our core businesses and capabilities will help us become a higher growth, more capital efficient company. After a careful review of our businesses and strategic initiatives, we have made the difficult decision to wind down our Assurance business. Assurance was acquired by Prudential in 2019 to expand the company’s direct-to-consumer access to the U.S. mass market. Since then, the team has made meaningful progress in realizing Assurance’s vision to help people improve and protect their personal and financial well-being, while navigating a challenging business environment for the broader insurtech industry. However, as we sharpen our focus as an enterprise on growth, it is critical that we prioritize core businesses and capabilities where we have a competitive advantage. Business decisions like this are never easy, and we are working with the Assurance leadership team to support our employees, customers, and partners throughout this process. I want to thank all of our employees and other partners at Assurance for their dedication over the past five years. And more broadly to our teams across the U.S., thank you for always keeping our customers, clients, and each other top of mind.” Story updated with comments from earnings call.",

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle-based digital healthcare startup 98point6 has conducted a new round of layoffs, the company confirmed Tuesday. 98point6 did not provide details on the number of employees affected. A number of posts from affected workers began showing up on LinkedIn last week. One affected employee told GeekWire that a majority of staff was let go. Another worker who joined the company more than six years ago called her layoff an “unplanned departure.” The company has around 100 employees in the U.S., according to LinkedIn. In a statement to GeekWire, 98point6 called the workforce reduction “part of a larger action at the company” and said a number of employees transitioned to Transcarent as part of its partnership with the San Francisco-based startup. 98point6 said it will continue to have an appropriate level of staffing as it continues to license its software to other healthcare organizations. LAYOFF TRACKER: A regularly updated list of tech layoffs in the Pacific Northwest. The layoffs follow a tumultuous past several years for 98point6, founded in 2015 as a virtual primary care provider. The company saw huge growth during the pandemic and raised a $118 million Series E round in late 2020. But then the startup went through an abrupt leadership change in 2021 when co-founder and CEO Robbie Cape was pushed out by the board. In July 2022, the company laid off 10% of its workforce, saying that the cuts were made “to align with the future needs of the business.” In March of last year, 98point6 announced that it was selling its virtual care platform and primary care business to Transcarent for $100 million in cash and equity. 98point6 relaunched as a software-only company focused on licensing its tech to third-party healthcare providers. RELATED: Tech job market remains in flux as layoffs continue and experienced workers struggle to get hired A month later, in April 2023, 98point6 raised $30 million to support its transition to the new business model. The investment was intended to help the startup scale the software business and develop new innovations such as data modeling and artificial intelligence. In January, the company acquired the remaining assets of Bright.md, a Portland-based asynchronous telehealth provider. 98point6 currently has no open positions on its jobs board. Cape, a Seattle tech veteran, founded the company alongside Gordon Cohen, a professor at the University of Arizona, and Jeff Greenstein, a longtime Seattle business leader and philanthropist who is chairman of 98point6. Greenstein became CEO after Cape’s departure. The company is currently led by CEO Jay Burrell. The tech downturn in 2022 led to widespread layoffs that continued throughout last year, when more than 250,000 tech workers lost their jobs. The pace of layoffs has slowed but companies are still shedding jobs in 2024, with more than 74,000 jobs cut at more than 250 organizations, according to Layoffs.fyi. 98point6 is currently in the No. 46 spot on the GeekWire 200 ranked index of Pacific Northwest startups. The company won the GeekWire Award for Health Innovation of the Year in 2019. It has raised nearly $300 million.",

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon Web Services will cut several hundred jobs in its Sales, Marketing, and Global Services organization, and a few hundred jobs on its Physical Stores Technology team, executives in the tech giant’s cloud computing division informed employees Wednesday morning in internal emails. In the Sales, Marketing, and Global Services organization, most of the cuts are in training and certification, and sales operations. The company said it’s shifting its focus to self-serve digital training and training programs run by external partners. AWS also cited overlap in some program management and sales operations roles. “We do not take these decisions lightly, and I know change can be difficult,” wrote Matt Garman, AWS senior vice president. “We operate in an incredibly fast-moving industry, and it is important that we stay agile as an organization.” He added, “The changes we are making are preparing the organization for the future, aligning with our strategy and priorities, and reducing duplication and inefficiency. I recognize the effect this has on every individual impacted.” RELATED STORYTech job market remains in flux as layoffs continue and experienced workers struggle to get hired For the AWS team that develops technology for Amazon’s physical retail stores, the cuts follow reports Tuesday that Amazon is shifting away from its “Just Walk Out” technology in its larger Amazon Fresh grocery stores. The layoffs will impact a portion of the AWS identity and checkout teams within the Physical Stores Technology organization, wrote Dilip Kumar, vice president of AWS applications, in a separate message to employees. “We’ve learned a lot through the launch of identity and checkout technologies in our large format Amazon Fresh stores, and have good customer feedback to inform our plans going forward,” Kumar wrote. “We are also expanding our identity and checkout technologies in smaller-format 1P [first-party] stores, and growing our third-party locations.” AWS said it will continue to hire and grow in other parts of its business. The cloud giant currently has thousands of open jobs, and says it’s working to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are being eliminated. In a statement, a spokesperson said AWS “identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact.” The company is “committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon,” the spokesperson said, adding that the decisions “are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers.” The job cuts are expected to take place in regions around the world, although the heavy concentration of AWS roles in Amazon’s hometown means that the decision is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the company’s Seattle workforce. Employees in the U.S. will receive pay and benefits for at least 60 days, outplacement job search support, and access to transitional health benefits, the company said. They will also be eligible for a severance payments. Many large tech companies have been making job cuts periodically for more than a year, starting in late 2022 and early 2023, seeking to focus their businesses and reduce operating costs. AWS was among the Amazon divisions impacted by the company’s overall reduction of 27,000 jobs in two major waves of layoffs last year. After experiencing a decline in profitability from mid-2022 to mid-2023, AWS rebounded with 29% and 38% increases in year-over-year operating profits in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively. AWS reported profits of $7.2 billion on revenue of $24.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing significantly to Amazon’s overall business growth. Amazon’s market share among cloud infrastructure providers dipped to 31% in the fourth quarter, according to Synergy Research Group, despite double-digit revenue growth rates. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud both grew at a faster clip, and boosted their overall market share to 24% and 11%, respectively. Demand for AI services is boosting cloud spending overall by large companies, with total enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services approaching $74 billion in the quarter, up $12 billion or 20%, according to the research firm.",

It now has 71 employees. Textio said it is shifting resources to support Textio Lift, a product it released last year which helps managers write feedback and avoid bias while providing reports to leadership. Founded in 2014, Textio uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help remove bias from workplace language for hiring and performance feedback. Customers include Bloomberg, Cisco, Hulu, Oracle, Spotify, and Warner Music Group. The company went through a small round of layoffs a year ago. More than 200 tech companies have laid off more than 50,000 employees so far this year, according to Layoffs.fyi. Last year, nearly a quarter million tech workers were laid off amid a tightened venture capital market and increased interest rates. Textio has raised $42.5 million from investors including Industry Ventures; Operator Collective; Emergence Capital; Scale Venture Partners; Cowboy Ventures; Bloomberg Beta; and Upside Partnership. Textio co-founder Kieran Snyder stepped down as CEO in January. Jensen Harris, co-founder and previously chief experience officer — and Snyder’s husband — is now CEO. Snyder remains on the board and has a new role as chief scientist emeritus. “The Textio team has evolved over the years, as has my personal relationship to the company,” Snyder wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.” But if you’ve been part of it, especially if you were part of it for a sustained period of time, you have me in your corner forever. This is on my mind right now as several people are moving on from Textio this week.”",

        "Extracted Article": "Expedia Group expects about 1,500 roles to be impacted, primarily in its Product &amp; Technology division, under an operational review announced in an internal memo to the online travel giant’s employees from CEO Peter Kern today. “With so much technical achievement over the last 12 months and so much tech debt behind us, we now are obliged to take a close look at roles, skills, teams, and locations to ensure that our resources are focused in the right areas,” Kern wrote in the memo, obtained by GeekWire. “While this review will result in us eliminating some roles, it will also allow us to continue to invest in core strategic areas.” Expedia Group announced Feb. 8 that Kern will be stepping down as CEO in May, replaced by Ariane Gorin, currently president of Expedia for Business. Kern will remain vice chairman and stay on the board. In a statement Monday, an Expedia Group spokesperson confirmed the key points of Kern’s memo, including the fact that the operational review “will result in approximately 1,500 roles being impacted across the globe” this year. Update: In a regulatory filing, Expedia Group said it will incur pre-tax charges of $80 million to $100 million related to the cutbacks. Update: A filing with the Washington Employment Security Department shows 208 employees in the state affected by the cutbacks. Julie Whalen, the Expedia Group chief financial officer, hinted at the possibility of cutbacks in the company’s fourth quarter earnings call on Feb. 8, saying at the time that the company was “taking a very close look at streamlining our cost structure to align with the next phase of our journey.” Expedia Group made widespread cutbacks as part of a restructuring just prior to the pandemic, after the ouster of its CEO and CFO in December 2019. Media mogul Barry Diller, Expedia Group’s chairman, and Kern, its vice chairman, took over day-to-day management at the time, prior to Kern’s appointment as CEO in April 2020. COVID-19 travel restrictions hit the company hard in the months that followed, along with the rest of the travel industry, but the company has since rebounded, with record annual revenue of $12.8 billion and profits of $797 million in 2023. After peaking at more than 25,000 employees in 2019, the company employed 14,800 people as of 2021. The company has made smaller cutbacks in recent years, including an unspecified number of jobs last year in its Traveler Products team, part of Product &amp; Technology division. However, its total employment still rose to 17,100 at the end of 2023, with about half of those positions in tech roles, according to Expedia’s annual 10-K filing. Expedia Group includes brands such as vrbo, Orbitz, Hotwire, Trivago, and Hotels.com in addition to the flagship Expedia.com. The company has unified the tech platform for its different brands in recent years, and last year launched a unified travel loyalty program called One Key for Expedia, Hotels.com and vrbo. Read the full memo from Kern below. Team, We’ve gone through a massive transformation and changed almost every aspect of our business, including how we’re structured, how our teams work together, and what we’re focused on to deliver the best experiences for our travelers and partners. Through this journey we have consistently had to evaluate how we allocate resources to the most important work to ensure we are as efficient as possible in driving our growth. With so much technical achievement over the last 12 months and so much tech debt behind us, we now are obliged to take a close look at roles, skills, teams, and locations to ensure that our resources are focused in the right areas. As a result, this year we will be reviewing our operations which we expect will result in approximately 1,500 roles being impacted across the globe, mainly in our Product &amp; Technology division. As always, we will be engaging in consultation with local employee representatives, where applicable, before making any final decisions. While this review will result in us eliminating some roles, it will also allow us to continue to invest in core strategic areas. Where we already have clarity on the proposed changes, we will be notifying employees as soon as possible. If your role is impacted or potentially affected, you can expect to hear details from either your leader, the People Team, or your local employee representative within the next week. I know my message may make some of you feel anxious, so I wanted you to hear this news directly from me. We are extremely grateful for every Expedian’s contributions, and I know we wouldn’t be where we are today without the contributions of every member of our team. While the needs of a company may evolve, this does not diminish the contributions you have made to our success now and in the future. It is never easy to say goodbye to colleagues. For those of you who do end up leaving us, a sincere thank you and we wish you every success in your future endeavors. We will be doing everything we can to support you, including providing severance packages, extended access to the Employee Assistance Program, and providing support for those who want to apply for another role internally. Thank you to everyone who has helped get us to this point in our transformation. Please treat each other with empathy and take advantage of our wellbeing resources if you need support. PK",

        "Extracted Article": "Glowforge laid off more employees after an investment round fell through recently at the Seattle-based maker of 3D laser engravers, the company confirmed to GeekWire. Co-founder and CEO Dan Shapiro declined to share how many people were impacted. In mid-December, Glowforge laid off 30 employees, and Shapiro said at the time that the cuts were necessary to help the company “get ready for what’s next.” This week, Shapiro said the last few months at the 9-year-old startup have been “a rollercoaster,” despite what he called a successful launch of the new lower-priced Aura engraver, which was designed to bring home crafting to a wider audience of consumers. “We had a challenging December when a new investment round was delayed,” Shapiro said via email. “Then another setback when it was canceled a few weeks ago.” Shapiro said revenue from the Aura and Glowforge’s other machines — the Plus and Pro — is enough to keep the company going. LAYOFF TRACKER: GeekWire’s regularly updated list of tech job cuts in the Pacific Northwest. “Unfortunately, to be cashflow positive, we had to reduce the size of our company,” he said. Glowforge, ranked No. 24 on the GeekWire 200 index of Pacific Northwest startups, had 145 employees last summer, and still employs roughly 75 people, according to the company’s About Us page. “As a part of our restructuring, we’re moving from 5-day-a-week customer support to 7-day-a-week; we’re doing that by moving to a hybrid of U.S.-based and international support team members,” Shapiro said. He said Glowforge is consolidating teams with fewer executives who have greater spans of responsibility. And internal AI tools will be used to offload busywork and let teams focus on high-impact work. Shapiro founded Glowforge in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Mark Gosselin, the current CTO, and Tony Wright, who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter. The company raised $20 million as part of an extended Series E funding round in May 2023, and has raised $135 million to date. The venture capital market has cooled considerably following a record 2021. More than 260,000 tech employees were laid off last year, and companies continue to make cuts in 2024. “It sucks to lose great people,” Shapiro said. “As the company’s CEO, I’m responsible for this outcome. The folks who are leaving are brilliant, creative, and a part of the reason for our success. It’s my decisions that lead to them departing the company.” Glowforge is providing support to those who were let go with visa assistance, outplacement help, severance, and a full year of medical insurance paid by the company.",

        "Extracted Article": "Editor’s note: This story and GeekWire’s Layoff Tracker were updated to reflect that 42 U.S.-based employees were laid off. Seattle-based First Mode says it’s cutting back on its workforce as it adjusts to the market demand for heavy trucks that rely less on fossil fuels. The company is cutting around 20% of its U.S. workforce, or 42 employees. Most of the 240 employees currently working for First Mode in the United States are in Washington state — for example, at the company’s Seattle HQ and at its proving grounds in Centralia, Wash. Operations in Australia, Britain and South Africa “may also possibly experience redundancies,” while operations in Chile are “not currently impacted,” First Mode CEO Julian Soles said in an email sent to employees. Despite the cutbacks, First Mode is continuing with plans to retrofit mining trucks to reduce their carbon footprint and address the climate challenge. “This is the year that we deliver commercial products to our customer sites. It is also when we finalise our transformation from an engineering services firm to a global decarbonisation product company,” Soles wrote, using British spellings. Next month, First Mode will officially open a 40,000-square-foot factory in Seattle’s SoDo district to manufacture power systems and the associated ground infrastructure for its “Path to Zero” product line. When the Anglo American mining conglomerate acquired a majority share of First Mode a year ago, the business plan focused on converting heavy trucks to use First Mode’s zero-emission, hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain — starting with Anglo American’s fleet. Since then, however, First Mode has determined that potential customers prefer a step-by-step approach to decarbonization. As a result, the company is working on a broader product line that also includes a lower-cost diesel-battery system — more like a Toyota Prius hybrid than a hydrogen-fueled Toyota Mirai. The Hybrid EV Retrofit, or HEV, is currently being tested at First Mode’s Centralia proving grounds, with commercial deployment due by 2025. First Mode says the diesel-electric hybrid reduces fuel usage and carbon emissions by up to 25%, thanks to regenerative braking. The retrofit package is designed so that the diesel-electric version can be reconfigured later as a fuel-cell or battery-electric truck, putting customers further along the path to zero carbon emissions. The #FirstModePathToZero starts with our turnkey HEV Retrofit.Demonstrated to reduce carbon emissions by up to 25%, we’re scaling its production in 2024 for deployment in 2025.Visit https://t.co/w5wmymX4te to unlock decarbonization for your haulage fleet. pic.twitter.com/P9IW5EIhpX— First Mode (@FirstModeHQ) January 2, 2024 “With strong customer interest, HEV has a clear commercial path forward,” Soles wrote in his memo. “By comparison, the nascent global green hydrogen economy is not yet where our customers need it to be for us to justify most of our FCEV [fuel-cell electric vehicle] spend and scope in 2024.” The wider short-term outlook for the hydrogen economy isn’t quite as sunny as it was a year ago. Last September, the International Energy Agency reported that cost concerns were “putting projects at risk and reducing the impact of government support for employment.” The long-term outlook still holds promise, however: In October, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that the Pacific Northwest will be home to one of seven U.S. hydrogen hubs, with up to $1 billion available to fund hydrogen-related projects. First Mode is among the ventures proposing projects. Soles said First Mode will have a key role to play in spurring the market for hydrogen-powered heavy vehicles “by solving the challenge of fuel cell power density, plus liquid hydrogen storage and refuelling as the global ecosystem of green hydrogen continues to develop.” In addition to reflecting First Mode’s revised strategy, the cutbacks address areas where last year’s business combination with Anglo American resulted in redundancies. When the $1.5 billion combination deal was closed, the plan called for First Mode to shift its corporate headquarters to London, where Anglo American is based. But since then, First Mode has decided to keep its HQ in Seattle. Soles, who came to the company from Anglo American, is said to split his time between London and Seattle. First Mode started out in 2018 as an engineering venture formed by veterans of a Seattle-area asteroid mining venture called Planetary Resources. The company initially provided expertise for space projects such as NASA’s Perseverance rover mission and the Psyche mission to a metal-rich asteroid. In 2019, First Mode began building an increasingly close relationship with Anglo American and eventually shifted its focus exclusively to clean tech.",

        "Extracted Article": "Flexe is trimming its headcount again in another round of layoffs. The Seattle-based startup cut 38% of its workforce, CEO Karl Siebrecht confirmed Monday. Update: A new filing from the Washington state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) system revealed 99 affected workers. “We remain committed to supporting our departing employees and to continuing to provide world class service to our customers,” Siebrecht told GeekWire. Flexe previously laid off staff in September, including 131 positions in Washington state. The company did not provide an updated headcount, but Flexe employed about 260 people before the latest cuts. A former Flexe employee posted about a Slack thread for impacted workers. The layoffs reflect how quickly times have changed for startups such as Flexe that raised gobs of venture capital but are now facing roadblocks on multiple fronts — both industry-specific hurdles and broader market challenges. Flexe, which helps online retailers with warehousing space and other shipping needs, is among a crop of logistics startups that have been forced to cut costs in recent months. Seattle-based digital trucking marketplace Convoy, which reached a $3.8 billion valuation in 2022, abruptly shut down late last year. Flexe was another so-called “unicorn,” reaching a $1 billion valuation in 2022 after it raised a $119 million Series D round. At the time, Flexe was coming off big growth, fueled by a pandemic-driven surge in online shopping and higher freight volumes. Layoff tracker: See all recent workforce cuts at our regularly updated list After the company raised its Series D round, Siebrecht told GeekWire that “we need to be really smart about how we manage that cash given the market uncertainty,” adding, “we have to make investments in scalable growth — not just growth itself.” Tech startups across various industries continue to lay off staff or shut down, as venture capitalists remain cautious about deploying money after years of skyrocketing valuations amid lower interest rates. GeekWire reported Monday about Seattle-based camper van startup Cabana closing up shop. Less than a year ago, Flexe won Next Tech Titan honors at the GeekWire Awards in May. The company’s former longtime CTO David Glick stepped down in January. Flexe investors include Activate Capital, Madrona Venture Group, Prologis Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Investment Management, Inc., and Tiger Global. Funds and accounts managed by BlackRock invested in the Series D round.",

        "Extracted Article": "Kaspien Holdings, a publicly traded company that helps online brands boost sales on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms, is closing up shop. The Spokane, Wash-based company said in a filing this week that it has initiated a plan to wind down operations and complete a shutdown by May 1 of next year, following an assessment of its cash and liquidity position and near-term debt maturities. Earlier this month the company said it planned to lay off its workforce with the exception of a “core group of employees” by the end of January. Kaspien has less than 100 employees, according to LinkedIn. Kaspien’s third quarter earnings report shows revenue of $26.4 million for the 13-week period ending Oct. 28, down 9.3% year-over-year, and a net loss of $1.8 million. The company reported a net loss of $5.1 million for the 39-week period ending Oct. 28. It previously reported negative cash flows from operations in fiscal 2022 and 2021. As of Oct. 28 the company had $400,000 in cash and cash equivalents. A number of other agencies that work with Amazon sellers have also faced recent struggles, including Benitago and Thrasio. Kaspien is led by CEO Brock Kowalchuk, who joined the company in 2018 after a 7-year stint with Goldman Sachs. He was previously CFO and became interim CEO in March 2022. The company traces its roots to a largely bootstrapped Spokane startup called Etailz that was acquired by Trans World Entertainment in 2016 for $75 million in cash and stock. Etailz rebranded to Kaspien in 2020, and Trans World also changed its name to Kaspien Holdings at the time. Trans World originally launched in 1972. Kunal Chopra, who led the company as CEO from 2019 to 2022, said on LinkedIn that he was “sad” to see Kaspien going out of business. “Companies that do not innovate are bound to fail,” he wrote in the post. “In a fast-paced, competitive world, getting outcompeted is just a matter of time.” Hannah Sandmeyer, director of sales and business development, commented on Chopra’s post, saying that the company “simply ran out of runway” and “now so many have lost their jobs right before the holidays and are scared.” “The business is a tough one, so many dark corners, margins so thin, and with such a big sail, it was hard one to pivot fast enough,” Sandmeyer wrote. Kaspien’s stock surged at the beginning of 2021, reaching a peak of $46 per share. But it has gone downhill from there, trading at around $0.05/share on Tuesday. The company said it expects the delisting of its common stock from the OTCQB to be effective on or around Jan. 8. Kaspien’s board of directors include W. Michael Reickert, managing member of Independent Family Office LLC; Jonathan Marcus, CEO of Alimco Re Ltd; Tom Simpson, an angel investor who helped start Etailz with Josh and Sarah Neblett in 2008; and Mark Holliday, president of Goshawk Capital Corp. We reached out to the company for comment and we’ll update this story if we hear back.",

And as we prepare for the opportunities ahead, we realized we had to make these changes to get ready for what’s next.” Shapiro declined to get into specific reasons for the cuts or provide an updated headcount number.

LAYOFF TRACKER: Our regularly updated list of layoffs in the Pacific Northwest. Shapiro said he’s “grateful and indebted” to the people who got Glowforge to where it is, as the company looks toward “big plans” in 2024. “As the CEO, I’m responsible for the impacts this has on our departing colleagues, and we are doing everything we can to help,” he said. “We’ve made sure the people affected have outplacement support, severance, visa assistance, and 12 months of paid medical coverage to support them.” Glowforge is also compiling an opt-in list of people affected and encouraging other employers to email great-people@glowforge.com for an introduction. Shapiro founded Glowforge in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Mark Gosselin, the current CTO, and Tony Wright, who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter. The company raised $20 million as part of an extended Series E funding round in May, and has raised $135 million to date.",

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle real estate startup Flyhomes has conducted another round of layoffs as the company faces what it calls “persistent and worsening industry headwinds.” Flyhomes shared the news in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday. The company did not specify how many employees were impacted, only writing that “many beloved teammates” had been let go. And a company spokesperson declined to share the company’s current headcount with GeekWire. The startup, which helps home-buyers secure purchases with all-cash offers, laid off an undisclosed number of employees in June. It cut 20% of its workforce in July 2022 and again reduced headcount in November 2022. LAYOFF TRACKER: Our regularly updated list of layoffs in the Pacific Northwest. More cuts appear to have taken place this fall, as Kyle Munson, a former VP of growth marketing at Flyhomes, posted on LinkedIn in November that he was “laid off a few weeks ago.” “This decision comes in the face of persistent and worsening industry headwinds which have prompted us to restructure our business to best meet the needs of our customers in a rapidly evolving real estate market,” the company’s post on LinkedIn said this week. “Each step we took these past few years was done with thoughtfulness and careful consideration to minimize these types of measures. Ultimately though, they simply were not enough, and for that we are sorry.” Real estate startups have been hit hard by higher mortgage interest rates and broader macroeconomic headwinds, and layoffs have been felt across the industry at companies including Redfin, Opendoor, Compass and others. Founded in 2016, Flyhomes is led by CEO and co-founder Tushar Garg. It has raised more than $200 million to date, including a $150 million Series C round raised in June 2021. The company offers a suite of mortgage and home-buying services. It provides a Buy Before You Sell program that helps sellers buy and move into their next home before selling their current property. In September, Flyhomes vacated office space near the Seattle waterfront to move to a 4,000 square-foot office at 500 Union St. Suite 325 in downtown. A company spokesperson said the downsizing of space was a result of shifting to a remote-first work policy, and an updated headcount was not provided. Flyhomes acquired the host-to-own startup Loftium in February. The company also acquired assets from Home Sale Assured, a Chicago-area company that helps homeowners move into a new home without needing to sell their current home. Flyhomes investors include Norwest Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Fifth Wall, Camber Creek, Balyasny Asset Management, Andreessen Horowitz, Canvas Partners, and former Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff.",

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon will eliminate several hundred roles in its Alexa division as part of a broader shift in priorities and a focus on developing new forms of artificial intelligence, according to an internal memo sent to employees Friday morning. “As we continue to invent, we’re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers—which includes maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI,” wrote Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV, in the memo, obtained by GeekWire. “These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in several hundred roles being eliminated.” Amazon did not provide further details on the initiatives being discontinued. It’s the latest restructuring to impact the Alexa team. Amazon conducted layoffs in its Devices &amp; Services division last year as part of company-wide cuts, amid reports that the unit was losing as much as $10 billion a year. The company is under pressure to keep pace in the rapidly advancing field of generative AI. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been grabbing attention for its advanced natural language conversations, including a mobile feature released by the San Francisco-based company for interacting with ChatGPT via voice and audio. Amazon in September previewed a generative AI-based Alexa feature called “Let’s Chat” that will allow users to engage in longer conversations with the voice assistant while maintaining the context of the discussion. Dave Limp, the longtime executive in charge of the Devices &amp; Services division, announced in August that he would be leaving the company. Former Microsoft executive Panos Panay was named his successor in September. Amazon has made recent cuts in other departments including music and gaming. Here’s the full text of the email sent this morning. From: Daniel RauschSubject: An Important Update for our Alexa Team Team, We’re really encouraged by the progress we’re making with Alexa: customers are interacting with Alexa tens of millions of times every hour and there are more than half a billion Alexa devices in customers’ homes. Our investments in generative AI are also bringing our vision for an even more intuitive, intelligent, and useful Alexa closer than ever before. As we continue to invent, we’re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers—which includes maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI. These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in several hundred roles being eliminated. Today, we will reach out to colleagues in the U.S. and Canada who are impacted by these role reductions. Notification emails will be sent out shortly, and we expect all notifications in the U.S. and Canada to be completed this morning (Pacific time). We will communicate with impacted colleagues in India next week, and are following local processes in other regions, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies, and possibly resulting in longer timelines to communicate. To those of you impacted by these reductions, please know we did not make this decision lightly. I want to sincerely thank you for all your hard work and dedication to the organization, and to our customers. We are committed to supporting you, and are providing packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, external job placement support, and paid time to conduct your job search. While this was a hard decision to make, we remain very optimistic about the future of Alexa. I want to reiterate that Alexa remains an incredibly important part of our business. I’m proud of the innovation we’ve driven, and continue to drive. Incorporating a new large language model into a voice-forward, personal AI, has been and continues to be an enormous scientific and engineering challenge. I’m excited for our customers to soon experience the future of Alexa, and to hear their feedback, so that we can continue to invent and evolve the experience for them. As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me or anyone on the leadership team if you have any questions. -Daniel",

        "Extracted Article": "Convoy’s plan to transform the trucking industry has come to a screeching halt. The Seattle company is closing its core business and laying off a majority of its workforce. “We hoped this day would never come,” Convoy CEO Dan Lewis wrote in a memo sent to employees Thursday morning. The startup sent shockwaves through the Seattle tech ecosystem and broader trucking sector after abruptly shutting down operations on Wednesday. In the memo, Lewis said the company faced both an “unprecedented freight market collapse” and “dramatic monetary tightening.” “This combination ultimately crushed our progress at the same time that it was crushing our logical strategic acquirer — it was the perfect storm,” he wrote in the memo, which you can read in full below. Lewis said the company spent the past four months assessing all possible strategic options for the business. “However, none of the options ultimately materialized into anything sufficient to keep the company going in its then current form,” he wrote. FOLLOW-UP: ‘The markets crushed us’: In tearful farewell to employees, Convoy execs reflect on shutdown The memo noted “potential future strategic options” but did not mention an acquisition. Before this week, Convoy had around 500 employees, down from a peak of about 1,500 people. The company raised $260 million at a $3.8 billion valuation just 18 months ago. Laid-off employees reportedly did not receive severance. Convoy certainly faced huge macroeconomic challenges. Freight demand has dipped, revenue per truckload is down, and there’s an oversupply of trucking companies. Avery Vise, a trucking analyst with FTR Transportation Intelligence, said it’s a challenging time for freight brokers because truck capacity is plentiful. That means shippers can find attractive freight rates with large asset-based carriers — versus smaller trucking companies like the ones Convoy targeted. Tim Denoyer, vice president and senior analyst with ACT Research, said he’s seeing shippers moving freight loads to their privately-owned fleets, which hurts the brokerage market. At the same time, digital brokerages such as Convoy are facing a liquidity crunch, according to Craig Fuller, CEO at freight industry news site FreightWaves. “Convoy was a victim of a violent commoditized industry that is facing one of its deepest recessions in decades and a sudden change in investor appetite from risk to unit economics,” Fuller wrote on Wednesday. Convoy co-founders Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale inside the company’s Seattle headquarters. (GeekWire File Photo / Taylor Soper) Convoy developed an Uber-like system that matched truckers with shippers. The company, backed by investors such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, bet that its technology would reduce costs and increase utilization compared to traditional brokerages. A former executive told GeekWire that Convoy didn’t build enough of a tech advantage. Other brokers either had similar apps or were “fast followers” and built new functionality. Another former employee cited a tension between leadership over how Convoy positioned itself — as a tech company or a logistics company. Speaking at a GeekWire event this summer, Lewis said Convoy leaned into tech more heavily as it started to trim expenses. “We became even more of a tech company in the last 12-to-18 months,” he said. RELATED: ‘Convoy Mafia’: Alumni from trucking marketplace company take the wheel at their own startups Convoy said in April 2022 that it expected to surpass $1 billion in annual revenue. Then the layoffs began. The company started trimming headcount in June of that year, just months after it raised the massive Series E funding round. Convoy went through another layoff in October 2022. Then this past February, Convoy cut staff and closed its Atlanta office, which opened in 2019. Another round of layoffs happened in June. Co-founder Grant Goodale announced that month that he would step down from his position as chief experience officer and transition to an advisory role. Other logistics startups such as Flexport and Flexe, which grew rapidly during the pandemic, have laid off staff amid the broader market slowdown and a lack of available venture capital dollars. Convoy competitors, ranging from traditional brokerages such as C.H. Robinson and newer players including Uber Freight, are also struggling amid the shaky trucking market. Reports emerged in August that Convoy was seeking a sale. But not many predicted that this week’s collapse was how the company would enter its next — or final — chapter. Read the full memo below: From: Dan Re: Business Update All, As you’re all aware, over the past few days we’ve been taking actions to minimize disruptions to shippers and carriers by ensuring that all in-transit shipments get to their proper destinations. Thank you to everyone who stayed focused and got it done. As usual, you guys do amazing work. With that action nearing completion, Convoy will be closing down its current core business operations. Some of our team will continue on to handle this windup transition and potential future strategic options (all whom have already been spoken with), today is your last day at the company. We hoped this day would never come. We spent over 4 months exhausting all viable strategic options for the business. However, none of the options ultimately materialized into anything sufficient to keep the company going in its then current form. So, what happened? In short, we are in the middle of a massive freight recession and a contraction in the capital markets. This combination ultimately crushed our progress at the same time that it was crushing our logical strategic acquirer – it was the perfect storm. Convoy’s tech centric approach to trucking created real benefits. It also created the conditions for a truly scalable technology platform and business model that would have yielded real financial gains when market conditions improve. But in the end, market forces were too strong for us to withstand on our own. We moved all business levers possible. But we were running up the down escalator…. and it kept speeding up. So despite your excellent work on our product and service innovation, extensive revenue driving efforts, and the painful and sweeping cost cuts you have had to endure, it was still not enough to get us into the financial position necessary to withstand the increasing pressures of the industry, without the need for outside funding. Alongside this unprecedented freight market collapse, the dramatic monetary tightening we’ve seen over the last 18 months has dramatically dampened investment appetite and shrunk flows into unprofitable late stage private companies. Add to that, amidst these freight and financial conditions, M&amp;A activity has shrunk substantially and most of logical strategic acquirers of Convoy are also suffering from the freight market collapse, making the deal doing that much harder. The perfect storm. Following an exhaustive process, spanning many, many months during which we explored all viable strategic options for the business, the result is where we are today. Convoy is closing the doors on its current core business operations and exploring and evaluating strategic options for what might come next. The work you’ve all done will leave its mark on the freight industry forever. This industry needs to modernize. Shippers want it, carriers want it, and the market wants it. We still believe that this will be the future for this industry. As I just shared on our call, I think the world of you. Over the past few months I experienced some of the highest highs and lowest lows in business, but throughout it I remained motivated because of the incredible people at Convoy who gave me inspiration every day. You guys rock. #TruckYeah, Dan",

Its office in downtown Seattle will remain in operation after the layoffs, according to the company. “Rapid hiring was essential to enable our growth up to this point, but it also created complexity that does not support continued growth at our scale,” Serafin wrote in the memo. “Simply put, the organizational structures, work processes and the way we made decisions previously don’t work for the company we’ve become, or the company we aspire to be.” In addition to the layoffs, “several hundred roles are changing or moving locations over the next year,” he wrote in the memo provided by the company to GeekWire and later made public on its site. Serafin explained that the changes will “touch every team at the company,” adding that they follow “a deep review of every function in the company.” The changes are meant to improve collaboration, time to market, and the ease of doing business with customers and partners, he wrote. He thanked and apologized to departing employees, outlining plans for a minimum of 10 weeks of severance pay for U.S. employees, depending on tenure and level, in addition to other benefits and career services. Qualtrics laid off about 270 employees in January. Hundreds of tech companies have laid off staff over the past few years amid a broader industry downturn, which came after a pandemic-driven software boom. Founded in 2002, Qualtrics bills itself as the leader and creator of the “experience management” category. Its products help companies collect and analyze data, through surveys and other technologies, to make customer and employee decisions. More than 90% of the Fortune 100 are Qualtrics customers. SAP acquired Qualtrics for $8 billion in 2019. The company spun out of SAP two years later and raised $1.55 billion in an initial public offering. Earlier this year Qualtrics went private again, with Silver Lake buying the company in a $12.5 billion deal. In the first quarter — the last time Qualtrics publicly reported financials — Qualtrics reported $409.8 million in revenue, up 22% year-over-year. The company has 28 offices globally. Qualtrics’ downtown Seattle tower was renamed Qualtrics Tower in 2019 when the company leased 275,000 square feet across 13 stories in the building, then under development. Qualtrics is now using eight of those floors.",

The company confirmed the cuts to GeekWire but did not provide specific headcount data. Flexe employs more than 400 people, according to LinkedIn. Update: A new filing with the Washington state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) system shows 131 layoffs at Flexe. Founded in 2013, Flexe sells on-demand warehousing space for online retailers, as well as transportation and fulfillment services. The company raised a $119 million Series D round last year, becoming one of Seattle’s rare “unicorns,” or startups valued at $1 billion or more. The freight market slowdown is impacting various logistics startups, including freight forwarding giant Flexport, which laid off 20% of its workforce in January and is in cost-cutting mode. Seattle digital trucking marketplace Convoy, another unicorn, has laid off employees several times over the past year. It’s a different environment than 2021, when funding to logistics startups such as Flexe nearly doubled year-over-year amid a pandemic-driven surge in online shopping and higher freight volumes. Flexe is led by CEO and co-founder Karl Siebrecht, the former CEO of AdReady and former president of aQuantive’s Atlas technology division. After the company raised its Series D round last year, Siebrecht told GeekWire that “we need to be really smart about how we manage that cash given the market uncertainty,” adding, “we have to make investments in scalable growth — not just growth itself.” The broader tech downturn spurred thousands of layoffs across the tech sector, though cuts have slowed in recent months. Flexe won Next Tech Titan honors at the GeekWire Awards in May. The company’s former longtime CTO David Glick stepped down in January. Flexe investors include Activate Capital, Madrona Venture Group, Prologis Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Investment Management, Inc., and Tiger Global. Funds and accounts managed by BlackRock invested in the Series D round.",

        "Extracted Article": "Outreach laid off 12% of its staff this week, the latest round of layoffs at the Seattle-based startup. A company spokesperson confirmed the headcount reduction in response to a GeekWire inquiry Wednesday evening. Outreach cited shifting economic conditions that have pushed the sales tech startup to implement a wide array of cost-cutting measures. Outreach did not provide an updated headcount. It will offshore certain business functions to Mexico City and India. “This decision was not made lightly,” the spokesperson said. “The overall economic environment has changed significantly over the last year. In order to ensure Outreach’s long-term success, we are making several changes to keep our costs in-line with a company of our size and stage.” The layoffs come after Outreach had a 5% cut in August 2022 and a 7% workforce reduction in February. It most recently laid off 5% of its staff last month. The startup also said in February that it suspended merit increases and the expansion or relocation of offices. “Our balance sheet remains strong, and we’re confident that these changes, along with ones we’re making internally, will help us achieve our goal of reaching profitability next year,” the spokesperson added. Outreach, launched in 2014, has more than 6,000 customers including Zoom, Siemens, Okta, DocuSign, and McKesson. It became a so-called unicorn startup in 2019 when it raised $114 million and surpassed a $1 billion valuation. It raised two additional fundraising rounds in 2020 and 2021. Seattle unicorn startups including Rad Power Bikes, Highspot, Karat, Convoy, and others have made cuts this year. Outreach is backed by Sands Capital, Salesforce Ventures, Operator Collective, Lone Pine Capital, Spark Capital, Meritech Capital Partners, Trinity Ventures, Mayfield, and Sapphire Ventures. The startup is ranked No. 2 on the GeekWire 200, our list of the top privately held companies in the Pacific Northwest. Update: Outreach confirmed that Amritansh Raghav, executive vice president of engineering, resigned from the company on Sept. 21. “We’re grateful for Amritansh’s many contributions to building a great engineering team and appreciate his commitment to ensuring a successful transition to new engineering leadership,” the company said in a statement.",

        "Extracted Article": "Several employees at Kent, Wash.-based Blue Origin are reporting that they’ve been laid off, marking a rare turnabout in the rapid growth of Jeff Bezos’ space venture. The reduction in force appears to be focused in the areas of human resources and talent acquisition, based on employees’ postings to LinkedIn. TechCrunch’s Aria Alamalhodaei, who reported the layoff trend on X / Twitter, said it looked as if “some (but not all) folks were given the opportunity to find another role” within the privately held company. Micah Thornton, a production control specialist at Blue Origin, wrote on LinkedIn that “several people from the Blue Origin Space Human Resource/Talent Acquisition team have been let go due to downsizing.” Several other employees wrote that they were laid off on Tuesday and are seeking new roles elsewhere. We’ve reached out to Blue Origin and will be updating this story with anything further that we can pass along. Founded in 2000, Blue Origin’s employment profile has been trending sharply upward in recent years, due to projects that include the suborbital New Shepard program (currently grounded after a launch anomaly that occurred a year ago), the BE-4 rocket engine and the orbital-class New Glenn rocket, the Blue Moon lunar lander and the Orbital Reef space station. The company’s workforce tally was less than 1,000 as recently as 2018. Two years ago, that count was reported at nearly 4,000 employees, and the figure rose to 6,000 by July 2022. Blue Origin’s current number of employees — including workers in Kent as well as in Alabama, California, Florida, Texas, the Washington, D.C., area and other locales — is said to have hit nearly 11,000. Despite the newly reported layoffs, Blue Origin is continuing to hire employees for other types of jobs, primarily in technical fields. The company’s career website currently has more than 440 job listings, although some of those listings refer to the same job. Update for Nov. 30: I’ve updated the reference to job listings to provide additional context.",

        "Extracted Article": "Expedia Group informed an unspecified number of workers in its technology organization Thursday that it’s eliminating their positions, the latest in a series of moves by the Seattle-based travel giant to overhaul its workforce. Those impacted by the cutbacks include employees in Expedia Group’s Traveler Products team, which is part of Expedia Group Chief Technology Officer Rathi Murthy’s larger Product &amp; Technology organization. “As we have begun looking to 2024, it is important that we are ready to ‘Build the world’s most loved AI powered travel apps.’ These changes to our org will help us take the next steps to move quickly and stay tightly aligned while simplifying where we can,” said Tript Singh Lamba, an Expedia Group senior vice president, alluding to the layoffs in an internal message Thursday evening, obtained by GeekWire. The primary focus of the internal email was not the cutbacks among rank-and-file employees but a series of changes in executive leadership, including one departure and one new hire. Eric Toyofuku, VP of research and advocacy, is leaving Expedia Group to pursue other opportunities, according to the email. Jonathan Finch, former Global CTO for Amazon Insurance, is joining Expedia Group and will lead its InsurTech business. The company acknowledged that it made cuts but did not provide specifics, including the number of employees impacted by the layoffs, in response to questions from GeekWire on Thursday afternoon. “We are committed to delivering great travel experiences for our customers as demand remains high,” a spokesperson said. “As we align operations to our business transformation, this has resulted in the elimination of some roles. We remain confident in our strategy and value the contribution of all our employees.” The company has made targeted layoffs at various points this year. Expedia Group made more widespread cutbacks as part of a restructuring just before the pandemic, when the travel industry was rocked by COVID-19 restrictions. At the same time, Expedia Group has continued to hire for some technology roles, capitalizing in some instances on layoffs by major tech companies earlier this year. After peaking at more than 25,000 employees in 2019, the company employed 14,800 people at the end of 2021, nearly half of them in tech-related positions. That rose to 16,500 at the end of 2022, more than half in tech roles. Expedia Group said previously that a new employee count won’t be disclosed publicly until the end of the year. Due in part to its increased employment and compensation expenses, Expedia Group reported that overhead expenses rose 14% in the second quarter to $627 million. Still, with record revenue of $3.36 billion, up more than 5%, the company was able to post a $385 million profit in the quarter, from a $185 million loss a year earlier. Expedia Group includes brands such as vrbo, Orbitz, Hotwire, Trivago, and Hotels.com in addition to the flagship Expedia.com. The company has combined the tech platform beneath its different brands in recent years, and recently launched a unified travel loyalty program called One Key for Expedia, Hotels.com and vrbo. Updated to correct the timing of Expedia’s February 2020 cutbacks.",

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle technical recruiting startup Karat is laying off 47 employees for the second time this year, part of an effort to restructure various organizations within the company and make progress towards profitability. The startup confirmed the cuts to GeekWire on Wednesday. It did not provide an updated headcount, but according to LinkedIn, the company has 393 employees, down from 423 employees in January. “Karat has made significant progress against the investment areas we outlined at the start of the year — we are on track to double our number of global enterprise customers and have become the first end-to-end hiring solution,” a company spokesperson said via email Wednesday. “We also continue to advance equity across the tech industry, scaling up our Brilliant Black Minds community to over 4,000+ Black engineers and adding new corporate Partners of Brilliance to hire them.” The layoffs impacted various roles, including product, client service, and go-to-market organizations, the spokesperson said. This is the second round of cuts this year, including a workforce reduction that also impacted 47 employees in January. Companies of all sizes are being advised to cut costs and reduce spending amid the broader tightening of the economy and slowdown in venture capital spending. Large Seattle startups including Convoy, Highspot, Flyhomes, and others have announced layoffs this month. Founded in 2014, Karat is led by Mo Bhende, a former director for Xbox at Microsoft, and co-founder Jeff Spector, who previously was chief of staff to Melinda French Gates at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The startup uses a network of vetted interviewers who run the interviews via video conference, using a question format and scoring rubric based on research and analysis done by Karat. Companies receive feedback on the top qualified applicants, based on Karat’s due diligence, as well as insights about their hiring process. The idea is to help companies screen more candidates while freeing up their own employees from interviewing responsibilities. Its software is used by tech companies such as Compass, Intuit, and Indeed, and others including Ford, American Express, and Bank of America that need help interviewing engineers. Karat became one of Seattle’s highest-valued privately held startups after it raised $110 million in a Series C round in 2021, which brought its total valuation to $1.1 billion. It currently ranks No. 25 on the GeekWire 200, our list of the top startups in the Pacific Northwest. Karat’s Brilliant Black Minds uses Karat’s Interviewing Cloud to deliver free interview practice, feedback, and coaching to help aspiring Black software engineers prepare to successfully enter the tech industry. Tennis star Serena Williams invested in the startup last April.",

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle-based trucking marketplace Convoy has conducted another round of layoffs, its fourth in the past year, the company confirmed to GeekWire on Monday. The cuts impact the company’s customer-experience operations team. Convoy did not disclose how many people lost their jobs and did not provide an updated overall headcount. LinkedIn lists more than 800 employees at the company. “Earlier this year, we staffed this team at levels necessary to ensure a smooth transition to our new dedicated service model and to be prepared for a potential freight market rebound,” a Convoy spokesperson said in a statement. “With our customer service model transition complete and demonstrating efficiency levels double that of 2022 in many cases, coupled with a delayed rebound in the overall freight market, we are now right sizing staffing levels accordingly.” Convoy said the adjustment is specific to, and does not extend beyond, the customer experience operations team. That team’s staffing model is designed to be flexible for changing seasonal and economic conditions. Convoy previously made layoffs in February and closed its Atlanta office, which it first opened in 2019. Last year, cuts were made in October and June. Co-founded in 2015 by Amazon vets Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale, Convoy aims to increase earnings for truck drivers while simultaneously reducing cost for shippers by removing inefficiencies in the existing supply chain. Truck drivers download Convoy’s free app to find work without going through brokers who typically use emails and phone calls. Goodale announced last week that he is stepping down from his position as chief experience officer and transitioning to an advisory role by the end of the month. Lewis discussed the state of the trucking industry and more during a GeekWire interview on June 15. Convoy has grown to become one of the highest-valued privately held startups in the Seattle region. It raised $260 million at a $3.8 billion valuation last year. Convoy is No. 5 on the GeekWire 200, our list of the top startups in the Pacific Northwest.",

        "Extracted Article": "Zulily is laying off workers again. Several employees of the Seattle-based e-commerce retailer were let go from the company this week. The latest cuts follow an ownership change last month. Qurate sold the company to Los Angeles-based private equity firm Regent for an undisclosed purchase price. “We announced to our team members some difficult choices that have required the elimination of positions within the Zulily corporate teams as we focus on transforming the business for the future,” a Zulily spokesperson said in a statement. The company declined to provide details about the number of employees let go. Affected employees told GeekWire that they did not receive severance. Zulily laid off employees in March to help cut costs, and had another round of layoffs a year ago. Zulily reported a 17% drop in revenue during the first quarter, to $192 million, and a $43 million operating loss. Qurate cited lower unit volume and a reduction in shipping revenue “largely driven by reduced traffic to the site.” Zulily revenue dropped 28% in the fourth quarter. Qurate said it divested Zulily to focus on its core assets, including QVC and HSN. It paid $2.4 billion to acquire Zulily in 2015. In a press release announcing its acquisition, Regent said it planned to grow Zulily’s business in new markets. Regent’s portfolio includes Club Monaco, Dim Paris, and Redline Bicycles. Founded in 2010, Zulily went public in 2013. The company got its start by offering daily deals on products for moms and kids, and later expanded its product selection. Zulily last year hired former Nordstrom exec Terry Boyle as president and CEO.",

        "Extracted Article": "Real estate startup Flyhomes is laying off employees for the third time in a year, citing an effort to focus on profitability amid the broader housing market downturn. The Seattle company confirmed the cuts to GeekWire on Monday. A spokesperson declined to provide details on the number of employees affected or an updated headcount. LinkedIn posts from recently laid off employees suggest the cuts impacted operations associates and underwriters. “I will confirm that this extremely difficult decision was necessary for the company to navigate the sustained, challenging real estate market conditions and drive our continued focus toward profitability,” Flyhomes spokesperson Justin O’Neill told GeekWire in an emailed statement. Flyhomes, which helps home-buyers secure purchases with all-cash offers, laid off 20% of its employees in July. The company reduced headcount again in November. It now has about 470 employees, down from about 700 in November, according to LinkedIn. Seattle real estate tech companies including Redfin, Zillow, Loftium, and Inspectify have also trimmed their workforces. U.S. home prices and sales continue to trend downward amid higher mortgage rates and a lack of supply. Pending home sales were down 17% in the four-week period ended May 28; median sale prices were down 1.9%; and new listings were down 23%, according to a recent Redfin report. Many venture-backed startups across various industries are being advised to reduce headcount and extend cash runways to withstand prolonged economic headwinds and slower funding. Venture capital allocated to Seattle-based startups hit a 6-year low in the first quarter. Founded in 2016, Flyhomes offers a suite of mortgage and home-buying services. It offers a Buy Before You Sell program that helps sellers buy and move into their next home before selling their current property. Flyhomes’ reduction comes after the company acquired the host-to-own startup Loftium in February, which included onboarding 11 new employees as part of the deal. The company is led by CEO and co-founder Tushar Garg. It has raised more than $200 million to date, including a $150 million Series C round raised in June 2021. Investors include Norwest Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Fifth Wall, Camber Creek, Balyasny Asset Management, Andreessen Horowitz, Canvas Partners, and former Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff.",

The company is slashing 158 jobs in Washington state, where it is headquartered, according to a new filing with the state Employment Security Department (ESD). The layoffs are not part of the 10,000 global layoffs announced by Microsoft on Jan. 18. “Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. “We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners.” The company declined to provide details about additional cuts beyond Washington state, or which areas of the company were affected. More than 2,700 Seattle-area workers were affected by the layoffs announced in January. The company said originally that those layoffs would be made between January and the end of March, the end of the company’s fiscal third quarter. Microsoft is one of numerous tech companies to make layoffs in recent months, including Facebook parent Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce, and many startups. Microsoft is navigating various macroeconomic headwinds, including a pullback in business technology budgets and more cautious customer spending for cloud services and software licenses that drive the bulk of its business. The company told employees Wednesday it is not raising salaries this year, citing a “dynamic economic environment.” Microsoft had 221,000 employees as of June 30 (when it last reported headcount), an increase of 40,000 people or 22% from the same point the prior year. It was the largest annual increase in employment in Microsoft’s history, based on data tracked by GeekWire. Microsoft last month reported revenue of $52.9 billion for its fiscal third quarter, a 7% increase from last year. The company beat analyst expectations of $51 billion. Profits came in at $18.3 billion, up 9%. The 7% revenue increase represents the second straight quarter of single-digit growth. It’s a far cry from 18 months ago, when Microsoft’s year-over-year revenue growth peaked at more than 20% as the company and broader tech economy emerged from the pandemic with a head of steam. Microsoft stock is up 29% this year, and up 15% over the past 12 months. The company ended its fiscal third quarter with $104.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.",

A company spokesperson confirmed the cuts to GeekWire on Wednesday. This is the third time in less than a year the Seattle real estate company has conducted a workforce reduction. “While another layoff is painful, especially for those leaving the company, Redfin must continue to adapt to the current economic climate,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Redfin said last November that it would wind down its home-flipping program RedfinNow and eliminate 862 positions, or 13% of its workforce. That came after an 8% workforce reduction last June. Redfin revenue fell 25% in the fourth quarter after mortgage rates and a sluggish market kept many buyers and sellers on the sidelines. The company also reported a net loss of $61.9 million, compared to $27 million in the year-ago quarter. The layoffs come despite Redfin’s statement in January that the housing market had begun to recover. That report cited increases in the number of users requesting tours and contacting agents to start the home-buying process. The most recent round of cuts will mostly affect workers in the real estate support segment. Laid off employees will receive 10-15 weeks of severance depending on tenure and healthcare coverage for three months, according to the spokesperson. A number of real estate tech companies have laid off employees in Washington state over the last year in response to the market downturn including Zillow, Flyhomes, Compass, and others.",

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Outreach, Convoy, Leafly and numerous other companies in the Seattle region have reduced headcount amid the broader tech industry downturn and ongoing economic uncertainty. Founded in 2017, Nori’s blockchain-based model pays farmers to use verifiable, sustainable practices that store carbon dioxide. Its current focus is selling carbon sequestered in soils via its partnership with Bayer and individual growers. Nori recently launched its Web3 integration by moving the entire marketplace on-chain. Gambill said that makes it simple for any decentralized application “to automatically incorporate carbon removal and give their users the ability to make a difference in reversing climate change.” A Techstars Sustainability Accelerator graduate, Nori raised $7 million in February 2022 in a Series A round led by M13.

Co-founder and CEO Kieran Snyder told GeekWire that the reduction was a result of the uncertainty that lies ahead in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The cuts leave the company with about 120 employees. Coronavirus Live Updates: The latest COVID-19 developments in Seattle and the world of tech “As we think about what the year ahead looks like, I think there’s a broad shift for us,” Snyder said. “Obviously we make software that helps organizations hire and I’d say that hiring in many places is very, very active and in several other places is slowing down, just in response to the COVID-19.” Snyder referenced the record 3.3 million Americans who filed for unemployment last week and said that part of the 6-year-old startup’s ability to wrap its head around the entire situation will be understanding what it can do to help talented people find jobs. “We’re in a position where we see that we have some technology that can help with the other side of the equation. We’ve been supporting employers for such a long time, there’s some opportunity to support job seekers in this environment,” Snyder said of the desire to quickly implement new features in Textio’s AI-powered natural language processing technology. Job seekers using Textio would be encouraged to better understand how language they use best represents them, their skills and their interests in the job market. It’s about making an effective case personally, in a way that Snyder said companies have had to do for the last five years. Snyder elaborated more in a string of Tweets on Friday: 1 Today we are saying farewell to several incredible people from our @textio team. If you hire them, you’ll be lucky. I’d like to share their stories with you, and will, in their own words, on this thread. &gt;&gt; — Kieran Snyder (@KieranSnyder) March 27, 2020 The desire to act fast, not just to help her own team members, is the right thing to do, Snyder said. But it doesn’t lessen the pain of what she was dealing with on Friday as a company leader. CEO Kieran Snyder and some of the Textio team on stage at the 2019 GeekWire Awards in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) “It’s painful. How could it be anything other than painful?” she said. “You build a group of people who are passionate about language and culture and impact and improving the state of the world. And those relationships aren’t just about work, people joined Textio because they believed in what Textio was creating. “I think for a lot of people on the team, it isn’t just a job and for me as a leader, they’re not just people on the team,” she added. Snyder and co-founder Jensen Harris launched Textio in 2014 after working on productivity tools at Microsoft. The company raised a $20 million Series B investment round in 2017 and SEC filing from earlier this month noted that the company was raising new funding. Textio was among the startups featured in a recent GeekWire story about how Seattle companies are adjusting to remote work amid the COVID-19 outbreak. And this week they released new features aimed at addressing language bias related to ageism and ableism.",

        "Extracted Article": "Editor’s note: This story was updated with information from Leafly’s fourth quarter earnings report and an internal email sent from the company’s CEO. Leafly is laying off 40 employees, about 21% of its workforce, as it looks to conserve cash and reach profitability amid various headwinds affecting the cannabis company’s business. The company revealed the news as part of its fourth quarter earnings report. GeekWire reported the cuts earlier Thursday, citing posts from several employees — including a creative lead and vice president of retail sales — who said they were laid off. Leafly previously cut 56 positions, or 21% of its workforce at the time, in October. In an email to employees obtained by GeekWire, Leafly CEO Yoko Miyashita cited reduced advertising spend and “a slower start to 2023 than anticipated.” “Our customers are in belt-tightening mode and that necessarily impacts their spend on Leafly,” she wrote in the memo, which you can read in full below. The company went public last year in a SPAC deal and its stock has lost nearly all of its value since then. Leafly received a letter Oct. 28 from the Nasdaq notifying the company that it did not comply with the $50 million market value minimum required to be listed on the exchange. Nasdaq said Leafly’s market value must be $50 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time before April 26. The company has a market capitalization of around $20 million and is among Nasdaq’s list of noncompliant companies. “Rationalizing our cost structure, preserving cash, and ensuring sustainability of Leafly as a public company by focusing on improving our path to profitability,” Miyashita wrote in the memo, as part of the company’s current priorities. Leafly’s revenue in Q4 stayed flat year-over-year at $12.1 million, and losses grew slightly to $5.8 million. It ended the quarter with about $25 million in cash. The company’s average monthly users; ending retail accounts; and retailer average revenue per account all fell year-over-year in 2022. Average monthly users came in at 7.96 million for 2022, down 22% from the year prior. Founded in 2010, Leafly’s online marketplace lets customers shop and select cannabis products from licensed retailers. The startup also serves as an educational resource. Its revenue primarily comes from a monthly subscription fee paid by cannabis retailers to be listed on the platform and to access e-commerce tools. Leafly is facing headwinds in the form of decelerating digital ad spend, part of a broader shift by companies to cut costs amid higher interest rates and the tech downturn. Cannabis sales in some regions are declining following a pandemic-driven boost. Sales in Washington state slowed year-over-year in 2022 for the first time since cannabis was legalized. Retail and wholesale prices are also down. Leafly’s average revenue per account in Q4 was $566, down $70 from the year-ago period. The company is reorganizing its sales and content/creative teams to focus on “high-value customers” and create content that drives shopping behavior. Read Miyashita’s full memo below. Dear Team Leafly, We are experiencing times of significant change and uncertainty in the cannabis industry. Over the past several months, we’ve seen our revenue come under additional pressure with a weaker holiday season and a slower start to 2023 than anticipated, as clients reduced their advertising spend. Our customers are in belt-tightening mode and that necessarily impacts their spend on Leafly. This is the broad context under which I share the difficult news that we have decided to make additional headcount reductions that will impact 41 positions – or roughly 21 percent of our current workforce. Those impacted have already received meeting invites to speak with leadership and HR later today – if you have not received a meeting invite by 10:30am PT/1:30pm ET today, your role is not impacted. Transitions like this are very difficult as the impact is felt by our teammates, colleagues, and friends. People we have come to know and partnered with through the ups and downs at Leafly. I fully acknowledge that and I am deeply sorry for the circumstances that have led to this outcome. Leafly is, and will remain, a prominent player in the cannabis space, but to navigate current realities, we must operate differently and become intently grounded in three priorities: Aligning our resources around one common theme: building a stronger marketplace – one that delivers against the need to help consumers identify what to try and buy, then delivers them to the virtual and physical doorsteps of our retail and brand partners; Focusing on the areas of our business that deliver the most near-term revenue; and Rationalizing our cost structure, preserving cash, and ensuring sustainability of Leafly as a public company by focusing on improving our path to profitability. These priorities mean significant changes to certain areas of our business, including to sales and to our content and creative teams. On the sales side, we need to get closer to our most high-value customers, requiring a shift from a broad-based, high-touch model to most clients, to a model that is hyper-focused on deepening relationships and growing spend from our emerging and highest-value clients. As part of this shift, we must align our customer account management, services, and support to be more cost-efficient and in-line with a client’s revenue contribution. These priorities also mean changes to our content and creative teams. Over the past 10+ years, we built from scratch one of the most recognized news and learn sections in the industry, and we now have a rich catalog of thousands of pieces of useful and sought-after cannabis information. At the same time, we are now competing against some of the biggest names in journalism. Under this new reality, we are making an explicit shift to anchor our content strategy directly to the revenue generating aspects of our cannabis marketplace to include more content that drives shopping behavior and creates value for our retailers and brands in the form of more bottom-of-the-funnel sessions and orders. To those who are leaving us: Thank you. Thank you for working so hard to bring the magic of cannabis to countless people and for your contributions to Leafly. We are grateful for you. For those who are continuing forward, we are competing in a tough environment. By making the necessary changes to how we operate, and sustaining this business and one another through a difficult period, I am confident about the opportunity for Leafly ahead. Our partners tell us there is tremendous value in working with Leafly and we should all be proud of the work we have accomplished together and our commitment to serving those partners for many years to come.

        "Extracted Article": "Neoleukin Therapeutics is slashing its workforce by about 70% as it seeks “strategic alternatives” for its future, according to a company statement Wednesday. The publicly traded Seattle biotech company hired investment bank SVB Securities to review potential alternatives including a sale, merger, asset divestiture or licensing. “It was a difficult decision to restructure our workforce as we conduct this review of strategic alternatives; however, we believe it was a prudent decision that will maximize shareholder value,” said board chairman Todd Simpson in the statement. Neoleukin’s stock was up more than 30% in Thursday trading. The company said CEO Jonathan Drachman will also step down after a short transition. Drachman, a former executive at Seagen, led Neoleukin since it spun out of the University of Washington in 2019. The job cuts are expected to be completed by the end of June. The cuts are the second round of layoffs for the company, which announced a 40% workforce reduction in November. Neoleukin currently has 46 employees, according to a spokesperson, down from 77 in September. The November layoffs coincided with a decision by Neoleukin to discontinue development of a computationally designed protein therapeutic being tested in a phase 1 trial. The protein was designed to mimic the powerful immune molecules Interleukin-15 and Interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 can quell cancer but it can also have toxic effects, which Neoleukin’s protein aimed to to minimize. The trial was the first to test a synthesized protein engineered “de novo” from scratch, according to the company. The program was shuttered “based on a review of the preliminary data, the expected benefit to risk ratio for patients, and recent developments in the field of IL-2 therapeutics,” according to a November company statement. Neoleukin shifted its focus to developing other protein therapeutics. In Wednesday’s statement, Simpson cited “challenging capital markets” and the time and investment needed to further develop Neoleukin’s technology as barriers. Multiple other companies are testing IL-2 therapies in the clinic, including Cue Biopharma, Anaveon and Aulos Bioscience. Seattle biotech company Good Therapeutics sold its IL-2 program to Roche for $250 million in September and later rebranded as Bonum Therapeutics. Neoleukin was incubated at the UW’s Institute for Protein Design and merged with another biotech company to go public in August 2019, raising more than $40 million. Neoleukin later raised $86.2 million in a public offering. As of September 30, the company had $106.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The layoffs are the latest to hit biopharma in Washington state, which has seen workforce cuts at Absci, Zymeworks, TwinStrand Biosciences, NanoString Technologies, Sana Biotechnology, Eliem Therapeutics and others. Last week Novo Nordisk announced it was laying off 86 workers and shutting a lab site in Seattle. More than 40 biotech companies have laid off employees this year, adding to 119 last year, according to Fierce Biotech’s layoff tracker. Novartis and other big pharma companies have also seen workforce cuts.",

A company spokesperson confirmed the layoffs but declined to provide details on how many positions were impacted or current headcount. “Yesterday, we announced to our team members some hard choices we have made for our organization to bring our operating expenses in line with our revenue and position our business for future growth,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. Laid off workers will receive severance, continuation of some benefits, and outplacement assistance, the spokesperson said. Zulily previously laid off employees in May. The company employs more than 800 people in the Seattle region and nearly 2,000 total, according to LinkedIn. Zulily’s revenue dropped 28% to $254 million in the fourth quarter due to lower unit volume, reduced shipping rates, and lower site traffic, according to the company’s earnings report. Revenue dropped 38% for the full year. Its parent company Qurate Retail Group, which acquired Zulily in 2015, reported a 13% year-over-year revenue decline for the fourth quarter. Qurate last week said it was laying off 12% of its workforce, or 400 people. Those cuts did not impact Zulily. Last year Zulily closed a fulfillment center in Pennsylvania, resulting in more than 500 layoffs. Many e-commerce companies are dealing with slowing growth following online shopping surges during the pandemic. Qurate CEO David Rawlinson called 2022 a “challenging year for the company” and cited “macro pressure that impacted consumer demand.” “We have taken action to strengthen the balance sheet, improve execution and aggressively cut costs, including meaningfully reducing excess inventory and undergoing a structural reorganization,” Rawlinson said in a statement last week, as part of the company’s earnings report. Zulily last year hired former Nordstrom exec Terry Boyle as president and CEO. Boyle replaced Jeff Yurcisin, the former Amazon executive and Shopbop CEO who took over in May 2018 for longtime CEO and co-founder Darrell Cavens. Zulily went public in 2013 and was acquired by Qurate for $2.4 billion in August 2015.",

        "Extracted Article": "Outreach is laying off 70 workers, about 7% of its workforce, marking the second round of cuts the Seattle sales software startup has made in the past six months. A company spokesperson confirmed the headcount reduction to GeekWire Monday evening. “Outreach regularly identifies the need to make operational and organizational adjustments to align with our strategic growth plan and path to profitability,” the spokesperson said. In an email to staff, Outreach CEO Manny Medina said the company failed to meet annual recurring revenue targets for its most recent fiscal year. “Even given the reduction in projected spending, we must find other savings in efficiencies and cut deeper,” he said in the email obtained by GeekWire. “In a software company, headcount is one of our greatest costs and, unfortunately, that means more layoffs within our Outreach team.” Outreach will suspend merit increases and the expansion or relocation of offices, Medina wrote in the email. The company laid off 5% of its staff in August. It has about 1,000 employees and offices in Prague, London, Atlanta, and Indianapolis, in addition to the Seattle headquarters. The announcement comes amid a tech slowdown that has affected enterprise sales teams and slowed demand for sales software. Many startups are being advised to lay off employees in an effort to reduce costs and extend cash runways. Outreach is the latest Seattle unicorn to slash positions; others including Karat, Icertis, Rad Power Bikes, Convoy, Qumulo, and Highspot have also conducted layoffs. Medina told GeekWire earlier this month that Outreach sales have taken a hit due to the tech layoffs, as it operates on a per-user basis. However, the tighter spending climate has driven sales reps to rely more heavily on the startup’s tools for buyer qualification, offsetting some of that loss in demand, he added. Outreach, launched in 2014, has more than 5,500 clients including Tableau, Okta and DocuSign. It became a so-called unicorn startup in 2019 when it raised $114 million. It raised two additional fundraising rounds in 2020 and 2021. Outreach recently announced it is testing a new feature called Smart Email Assist, an AI tool powered by OpenAI’s GPT-3 model that spits out a draft email to a potential customer based on prior exchanges between the buyer and seller. The startup is backed by Sands Capital, Salesforce Ventures, Operator Collective, Lone Pine Capital, Spark Capital, Meritech Capital Partners, Trinity Ventures, Mayfield, and Sapphire Ventures. Outreach, ranked No. 3 on the GeekWire 200, has been gearing up for a public offering.",

It has around 100 employees, according to LinkedIn. “Due to the current economic environment, we have had to make the difficult decision to reduce our company size and say goodbye to some colleagues,” Picnic CEO Clayton Wood wrote in a LinkedIn post Wednesday. Startups are being advised to reduce headcount in an effort to lower costs and extend cash runways. There have been thousands of layoffs at tech companies in the Pacific Northwest over the past two months. Picnic, founded in 2016, has raised more than $20 million to sell food assembly robots to restaurants and hospitality companies around the world. The food-automation company sells a pizza-making robot called the Picnic Pizza Station. The machine can help a single employee churn out up to 100 12-inch customized pizzas per hour. Picnic announced a partnership with pizza giant Dominos in September. It also works with Ole Miss, The Ohio State University, and a number of regional pizza restaurants and automation partners across the country. Wood said the layoffs will not affect these partnerships and that the company has installations planned across the U.S. and Canada. “Until the economic situation improves, we’re slimming down and running as efficiently as possible without impacting our mission or our core business,” he wrote.",

A LinkedIn search on Friday listed 423 employees, but Karat declined to say how many people remain at the company. RELATED COMMENTARY: Washington state’s tech industry will continue to grow, despite layoffs “These teammates were integral to growing Karat into the successful company it is today, and we are incredibly grateful to them,” the spokesperson added. “We have provided them with comprehensive exit packages, and we will do all we can to support their transitions.” Founded in 2014, Karat is led by Mo Bhende, a former director for Xbox at Microsoft, and co-founder Jeff Spector, who previously was chief of staff to Melinda French Gates at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The startup uses a network of vetted interviewers who run the interviews via video conference, using a question format and scoring rubric based on research and analysis done by Karat. Companies receive feedback on the top qualified applicants, based on Karat’s diligence, as well as insights about their hiring process. The idea is to help companies screen more candidates while freeing up their own employees from interviewing responsibilities. Its software is used by tech companies such as Compass, Intuit, and Indeed, and others including Ford, American Express, and Bank of America that need help interviewing engineers. Karat’s Brilliant Black Minds uses Karat’s Interviewing Cloud to deliver free interview practice, feedback, and coaching to help aspiring Black software engineers prepare to successfully enter the tech industry.

The cuts are part of a “company restructuring,” according to a statement shared with GeekWire. “Despite strong customer and revenue growth in 2022, we felt it necessary to optimize the efficiency of the company’s operating costs, given the unpredictable business environment in 2023,” the company said in its statement. Esper laid off 12% of its staff in June. The startup operates a DevOps platform for customers that manage fleets of company-owned Android devices. Esper has around 260 employees, according to LinkedIn, and employed 150 people when it raised a $60 million Series C round in October 2021. Layoffs continue to hit the tech industry amid an uncertain economic environment. Amazon confirmed this month that it’s slashing 18,000 corporate and tech employees; Salesforce is cutting 10% of its workforce, impacting Seattle-based Tableau; while Seattle startups such as Rad Power Bikes, OfferUp, Flyhomes, and others have also reduced headcount. Founded in 2018 by Microsoft vets Yadhu Gopalan and Shiv Sundar, Esper helps companies with development, deployment, and maintenance of devices used across industries such as healthcare, education, retail, restaurants, and more. The idea is to beef up traditional mobile device management (MDM) software with modern DevOps capabilities.

        "Extracted Article": "Bellevue, Wash.-based mobile marketplace operator OfferUp is laying off about 19% of its staff, joining a growing list of tech companies slashing costs amid a shaky economy. “We grew headcount rapidly over the past few years — at a rate that outpaced revenue growth,” OfferUp CEO Todd Dunlap wrote in an email to employees Tuesday. OfferUp did not provide details on total headcount. The company has just shy of 500 employees listed on LinkedIn. Nearly 800 tech companies have laid off workers in 2022, including many with a presence in the Pacific Northwest. Amazon is reportedly laying off 10,000 corporate and tech jobs; Seattle-area startups such as Convoy and Flyhomes also recently announced cuts. OfferUp still had “multiple years of runway” before deciding to cut staff, Dunlap wrote in the memo. But OfferUp is not hitting its revenue growth projections for 2022 and leadership concluded that “our current cost structure is preventing us from achieving our goals.” Dunlap, a former leader at Microsoft and Booking.com, took the CEO reins at OfferUp last year. He replaced founder Nick Huzar, who remains at the company as a board director. Founded in 2011, OfferUp competes against Craigslist, eBay, Facebook and other marketplaces where users buy and sell goods. The company has 56 million buyers and sellers on its platform and is currently ranked No. 6 on the GeekWire 200, our index of Pacific Northwest startups. OfferUp raised $120 million in March 2020 and acquired rival Letgo. The company is among an elite group of Seattle-area unicorns with a valuation of more than $1 billion. Earlier this year OfferUp added job listings with the launch of OfferUp Jobs in the company’s mobile app. Read Dunlap’s full memo below: OfferUp Team: Today is a difficult day for OfferUp and its employees, as I just met with some of our friends and colleagues to let them know that they are leaving OfferUp. This was a tough decision and it will have significant impacts on the people who are leaving, those who are staying, and the Company, so I wanted to take a few minutes to share with you the reasons for the decision and why I think it is necessary for OfferUp’s long-term success. Before I talk about the future, I want to acknowledge our colleagues who are leaving. They are valued contributors to OfferUp who had the misfortune to be in roles that are not required for our 2023 plans. We will miss them and I encourage you to reach out to them. I want you to know that we are doing everything we can to ease this transition. For those who are leaving today, we are offering: Severance – We wanted our colleagues to have pay through the holidays and into the new year, so all departing employees will receive at least 8 weeks of pay. Healthcare – To lessen the burden of healthcare costs, we will cover the employee portion of COBRA through January 2023. Outplacement Services – To help our departing colleagues transition into new roles, all of them will have access to career services through a company that specializes in career transition and job placement services. Stock Options – To give everyone a better opportunity to share in our future success, we are asking the Board to approve an extension of the expiration of departing employees’ vested stock options from the standard 3 months to 12 months. Laptops – In an effort to empower people to find their next job, we are allowing everyone to keep their OfferUp-issued computers at no cost. We wish our colleagues well and we hope to cross paths with them again in the future. Please join me in thanking them for their contributions to OfferUp. Now I’d like to talk about how we came to this decision. Many other companies at our stage are currently laying off employees and cutting costs because they face the possibility of going out of business if they don’t. Fortunately, we are not in that position and had multiple years of runway before the changes today. Having a stronger financial position is a benefit, but it can also allow leadership to avoid hard choices that are necessary. We grew headcount rapidly over the past few years – at a rate that outpaced revenue growth. I had hoped that our 2022 operating plan would generate enough revenue growth to allow us to grow into our current cost structure. However, by mid-year, it became clear that we would miss our revenue growth projections. The management team and the Board had a number of strategic discussions, both internally and with advisors, about how to proceed. These conversations always ended with the same conclusion – our current cost structure is preventing us from achieving our goals. We have built a large and active marketplace that serves tens of millions of users every month, but we’re not yet at a revenue scale that allows us to thrive without continued growth. At our stage, we need to demonstrate at least 2 or 3 of the following factors: Significant user growth, Significant revenue growth, Profitability, and Expansion of our market opportunity that will allow us to sustain growth and profitability well into the future. Our cost structure has not allowed us to make as much progress on these factors as we should have. As one example, to save expenses, we’ve mostly relied on organic growth in recent years. We spent a fraction of what other marketplaces spend on marketing, missing the opportunity to further raise awareness of OfferUp. Successful marketing tests earlier this year and increasing revenue per user give us some signal that we can spend more to bring users onto our platform in a manner that will be sustainable and profitable. However, that investment was not possible with our cost structure. There are other ways that we hope to do more by shifting our spending that I will share as we discuss more over the coming weeks. I am enthusiastic about the 2023 plan we just previewed with the Board, and I look forward to sharing details with all of you in the coming weeks. This is a plan that is both attainable and exciting, and it is only possible because of the additional capital available as a result of today’s decision. With a leaner, nimbler Company in 2023, we intend to: Develop features for our advertising products that will allow us to better monetize our marketplace activity – ideally in a way that improves the experience for both advertisers and users. Continue to expand our offerings into adjacent spaces – most notably by building on the early success of the jobs marketplace we launched this year. We’ve seen really strong signals in this effort and we think it can be a big part of the future of OfferUp and open the door to additional expansion opportunities. Significantly increase our user growth marketing investment to drive additional users, revenue, and profit. Offer additional tools and services to help the numerous sellers on our platform who are already successfully using OfferUp to enable their own business – whether they be a local merchant, a regional retail chain, or an individual making extra cash as a “side hustle”. Continue investment in the trust and safety initiatives that have made OfferUp the safest, most trusted local marketplace. Become EBITDA profitable by Q4 2023. Our 2023 plan is very focused on our best opportunities. If we achieve these plans, we will have many more options than we have today. It’s important that everyone who continues with OfferUp has the opportunity to benefit from those increased options, so I’ll be sharing some plans we have to share Company success with each of you. The leadership team will host a town hall discussion and listening session this Friday. More details on where to submit your questions for the town hall will come later today. I want to close by thanking you for your continued support of OfferUp and assuring you that I will do all I can to make sure that support is appropriately rewarded. For those of you who don’t have any urgent tasks today, please feel free to take the rest of the day to process today’s news. Todd Lost a job? Need help finding work?

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle real estate startup Flyhomes is laying off employees for the second time in five months. “Building the world’s best home buying and selling experience can only happen if we continue to adapt to the rapidly shifting market conditions, and take the necessary, albeit painful steps, to preserve capital through uncertain economic conditions to ensure the long term trajectory of the company,” the company wrote on LinkedIn. “The reality is, the housing sector is now in a recession, and the latest reports show that the market is expected to continue cooling for longer than anyone initially predicted.” A spokesperson declined to provide details on the number of cuts or total headcount. Update: Tracy Adamo, a director at the company who was laid off, wrote on LinkedIn that nearly 40% of the workforce was cut. The company laid off approximately 20% of its staff in July. It has around 700 employees, according to LinkedIn. Real estate tech companies are looking to cut costs amid a slowing housing market and rising interest rates, as well as broader economic uncertainty. Redfin announced it was laying off 13% of its workforce Wednesday. Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said the market in 2023 “is likely to be 30% smaller than it was in 2021.” Founded in 2016, Flyhomes helps people buy homes using a cash offer program which presents customers as the equivalent of cash buyers. The startup also offers mortgage services and has a Buy Before You Sell program that helps sellers buy and move into their next home before selling their current property. Flyhomes has helped customers buy more than $3 billion worth of homes. The company is led by CEO and co-founder Tushar Garg. It has raised more than $200 million to date, including a $150 million Series C round raised in June 2021. Investors include Norwest Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Fifth Wall, Camber Creek, Balyasny Asset Management, Andreessen Horowitz, Canvas Partners, and former Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff.

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon’s plan to “reimagine radio” has run into a bit of static as the company is making staff cuts at Amp, the app it launched earlier this year. Business Insider first reported the news on Friday and said “roughly 150 people,” or half of the division, were let go. Amazon would not comment on any figures when contacted by GeekWire. “At Amazon we think big, experiment, and invest in new ideas to delight customers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We also continually evaluate the progress and potential of our products and services to deliver customer value, and we regularly make adjustments based on those assessments. Following a recent review, we’ve made the decision to consolidate a few teams so we can focus on the growth and scaling of Amp.” Amazon is working with affected employees to identify other internal job opportunities. The company first revealed the new iOS app in beta in March, touting Amp as a way to give DJs their own live radio shows complete with a catalog of millions of licensed songs and the ability to engage with callers. “A person with their own unique music taste doesn’t have to land a job at a radio station to reach an audience,” Amp VP John Ciancutti said in March. “They just need to launch a show from their phone on Amp and reach anyone.” Fast forward seven months, where Thursday the tech giant saw its shares get hammered after it issued lower-than-expected guidance for the holiday quarter. Amazon is joining other tech companies taking steps to counter macroeconomic headwinds. The company has already slowed its hiring pace. During a third quarter earnings call on Thursday, CFO Brian Olsavsky said Amazon is preparing for “what could be a slower growth period” due to increased foreign currency headwinds, global inflation, heightened fuel prices, and rising energy costs. To help mitigate slowing sales, Olsavsky said Amazon is “taking actions to tighten our belt,” including pausing hiring in certain businesses and shutting down products and services. “We’re going to be very careful on our hiring,” he said.",

Advata laid off 32 workers yesterday, according to a statement from the company provided to GeekWire. Advata employed about 150 people in June, when it launched from the merger of six companies owned by Renton, Wash.-based healthcare giant Providence. “We are sincerely grateful for everyone’s contributions and extremely sad to see any of our team members depart from the Company,” said CEO Julie Rezek in an email to employees, a portion of which was provided to GeekWire. Several Seattle-area startups have laid off employees this year amid the broader economic slowdown and the decline in venture capital funding. Amazon, Microsoft, and other tech giants which grew headcount rapidly during the pandemic, are also cutting staff or slowing hiring. Advata was formed from Kensci, Colburn Hill Group, Alphalytics, Lumedic, Quiviq, and MultiScale by Providence. Software from each company integrated into Advata, which sells products for revenue cycle management, as well as population health tools. These tools, bolstered by artificial intelligence, aim to improve patient experiences, workflows, and accuracy of diagnoses. The independently operated company’s customers include Providence and other healthcare providers, as well as insurance and medical device companies. In September, Advata introduced a new revenue cycle management tool for healthcare providers that automates processing and advises staff on recommended actions. The company said the tool can enable teams to increase cash collections by as much as 1%. Lost a job? Need help finding work? GeekWire’s new recruiting service, GeekWork, can help.

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle-based trucking marketplace startup Convoy is doing another round of layoffs. It’s the latest tech company to trim headcount amid ongoing economic uncertainty and the possibility of a recession. In an email to staff, Convoy CEO Dan Lewis described a “reorganization and resource realignment.” He said Convoy’s customers are facing external pressures including supply chain shortages and inflation. “In an environment like this, companies that embrace change as the new normal and build resilience will be the winners in the years to come,” Lewis wrote. “Just as we need to embrace change and stay ever resilient, our customers are looking for partners to help them do so as well.” A Convoy spokesperson declined to provide details about the number of employees laid off. Several workers based in Seattle and Atlanta posted on LinkedIn on Monday, reporting that they were let go. Earlier this summer, Convoy cut 7% of its workforce. The company said it employed 1,300 people in April, when it raised a $260 million investment round at a $3.8 billion valuation, so those layoffs affected around 90 employees. Founded in 2015 and backed by the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, Convoy’s software automates transactions between trucking companies and shippers. Its network has more than 400,000 trucks and a roster of shippers including Home Depot, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, and Anheuser-Busch. The company, ranked No. 4 on the GeekWire 200 list of top Pacific Northwest startups, said in April it expected to surpass $1 billion in revenue this year. Convoy competes with a number of similar digital-focused shipping companies including Uber Freight, in addition to traditional brokers investing in their own technology. They are battling for a share of a $800 billion U.S. trucking industry. Convoy Chief Growth Officer Ryan Gavin. (Convoy Photo) In his email to staff, Lewis said the company is reorganizing its shipper-facing business function into a single organization led by Ryan Gavin, chief growth officer, who joined in 2019 after stints with Amazon and Microsoft. The company’s chief revenue officer, Melissa McCann-Tilton, will transition to advisor to the president and CEO and then depart Convoy at the end of this year. Lewis and Grant Goodale both worked at Amazon before launching Convoy. Goodale transitioned from the CTO role to chief experience officer last year. Convoy hired former Expedia CEO Mark Okerstrom as president and COO in 2020. A number of tech companies are laying off workers. Microsoft confirmed it was making cuts last week, as did application security and delivery giant F5, which cut about 100 jobs. Tech giants including Snap and Oracle have cut staff and others such as Meta and Apple are slowing or freezing hiring. Other Seattle-area companies including T-Mobile, Compass, Leafly and DreamBox Learning have recently been impacted by layoffs. Lost a job? Need help finding work?

        "Extracted Article": "New York-based real estate brokerage Compass has laid off 84 employees based in Washington state as part of a reduction that largely targets the company’s technology workforce. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, Compass said a significant portion of its cuts in headcount would come from the company’s product and engineering team. A Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification from the Washington state Employment Security Department on Wednesday put the number at 271 workers, with 84 “local” and 187 “virtual.” A Compass spokesperson said “virtual” employees were remote or spread across the country, but have to be assigned a location, so the Compass system considers them Washington employees. Amid a cooling U.S. housing market driven by increased mortgage rates, Compass previously stated in an Aug. 15 earnings call that it would be cutting costs in order to achieve profitability in 2023. Seattle-based Redfin also made cuts this summer, laying off 8% of its workforce to address to the housing downturn. LAYOFF TRACKER: A regularly updated list of layoffs in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest in 2022. In an email to Compass agents on Tuesday, founder and CEO Robert Reffkin said the company was fortunate to be able to reduce costs while still investing more than any other company in the real estate industry. “For example, the biggest reduction came from the technology team, however, our technology team is still over 700 people strong and likely larger than every traditional brokerage company’s tech team combined,” Reffkin wrote. Founded in 2012, heavily funded Compass made a splash in 2019 when it cut the ribbon on a West Coast engineering hub in Seattle, right in Amazon’s backyard. Reffkin said at the time that big companies like Amazon, Microsoft and the engineering hubs of Facebook and Google that are set up in Seattle drew Compass to the city. “A lot of big companies have enough people that want to be part of transforming a new industry,” Reffkin said. In March 2020, Compass laid off about 375 employees due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven months later, Compass acquired Modus, a Seattle startup that automated the title and escrow phase of closing on a home. After raising more than $1.5 billion from investors, Compass raised another $450 million when it went public in April 2021. The company posted a loss of $494 million that year. This past June, it shut down Modus, as it began its cost-cutting moves. The company laid off 450 workers, or 10% of its total workforce.",

        "Extracted Article": "DreamBox Learning laid off an undisclosed number of employees this week, citing the need for a “realignment” at the Seattle-area education technology company. Founded in 2006, DreamBox sells software to K-12 schools. The company’s technology adapts to individual students based on their answers and how they solve problems. Teachers and administrators get access to analytics and reporting. DreamBox says its products support 6 million students and 400,000 educators.s DreamBox employed 400 people as of last November, but the company would not say how many employees were impacted by layoffs or provide a current workforce total. Posts on LinkedIn by some former employees referenced a “large” and “unexpected” reduction in force. The layoffs come almost a year after the company sold a majority stake to Evergreen Coast Capital Corp., a tech-focused Silicon Valley affiliate of private equity firm Elliott Investment Management. “The recent realignment requires important strategic choices now that impact some employees,” DreamBox said in a statement provided to GeekWire. “Our leadership and investors agree that these changes effectively position DreamBox for long-term growth and sustainability, which enables us to continue to pursue a future in which all students have equal opportunity to achieve their highest potential in learning and in life.” DreamBox, led by President and CEO Jessie Woolley-Wilson, is one of many ed-tech startups that attracted attention during the pandemic and the shift to remote learning. But the layoffs reflect a tumultuous time in education. A survey earlier this year by National Education Association found that 55 percent of educators are thinking about leaving the profession earlier than they had planned. In August, The New York Times reported on staffing shortages affecting public schools across the country and inequities worsened by the pandemic. In DreamBox’s own backyard, a strike delayed the start of the new school year as Seattle Public Schools teachers and staff walked out over issues including pay and staff-to-student ratios for special education and multilingual students. Furthermore, troubling numbers have emerged from the pandemic, showing the worst drop in math and reading scores in decades for students in fourth grade. The Wall Street Journal reported that the “test scores indicate a learning deficit that could resonate for years and weigh on economic output.” LAYOFF TRACKER: A regularly updated list of layoffs in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest in 2022. DreamBox referenced the turmoil in its statement to GeekWire, saying that the solutions that it provides are needed now more than ever to reverse “troubling trends in learning.” “As district strategies are reshaped by unprecedented forces of change, DreamBox will continue to adapt how it partners with administrators to support all students and educators and intentionally evolve its own growth strategy and priorities,” the company said. TPG’s The Rise Fund, a social impact VC, invested $130 million in DreamBox three years ago. The company previously raised $14.5 million in 2013 and raised a $10 million Series B round in 2015. DreamBox was targeting 40% growth and annual revenue of more than $100 million last year.",

        "Extracted Article": "Amperity this week joined a growing list of Seattle startups that are trimming headcount. The customer intelligence company laid off 13 employees, or about 3% of its staff, a spokesperson confirmed to GeekWire. The company employs 375 people and plans to hire an additional 25 across the organization. “At Amperity, we are constantly monitoring our business to ensure there is alignment across the organization to support our strategic growth plans,” Amperity CEO Barry Padgett said in a statement Friday. “Today, we made the very difficult decision to eliminate thirteen roles primarily on our talent acquisition team. We are, however, continuing to hire and invest in specific areas of the business to help us execute on our growth strategy.” Tech companies have been laying off employees and slowing hiring in an effort to cut expenses amid uncertain economic conditions. Other Seattle-area tech startups including Flyhomes, Shelf Engine, Convoy, Outreach, Qumulo, and Esper have laid off employees in recent months. Founded in 2016, Amperity’s software lets companies fine-tune their targeted marketing campaigns by connecting fragmented data sources about individual customer habits via emails, purchase history, mobile app usage, website traffic, physical store visits, etc. The idea is to give marketers a holistic understanding of a given user and increase sales while driving brand loyalty. Amperity earned “unicorn” status in July 2021, reaching a $1 billion valuation after raising $100 million. The company’s co-founder Kabir Shahani stepped down as CEO and a board member earlier this year, with no public explanation. Padgett, who was previously president and COO, has been CEO since February of this year. He is a veteran of Concur Technologies and former chief revenue officer at Stripe. Derek Slager, who co-founded Amperity with Shahani, remains at the company as CTO. Shahani and Slager previously co-founded Appature, a health marketing startup that sold to IMS Health in 2013. Amperity’s backers include HighSage Ventures, Tiger Global Management, Declaration Partners, Madrona Venture Group and Madera Technology Partners. Its board includes Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain; Accolade CEO Raj Singh; former Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson; and singer-songwriter Ciara.",

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon is set to make another major acquisition. The Seattle tech giant said Friday it will scoop up iRobot, the Boston-area company known for its Roomba vacuum, in a $1.7 billion deal. The news comes just two weeks after Amazon announced it will acquire primary care company One Medical for $3.9 billion. This would be Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition ever, behind its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods, the $8.45 billion deal to buy MGM, and the One Medical acquisition. The iRobot deal signals Amazon’s large appetite for acquisitions amid the economic downturn and despite increasing U.S. antitrust scrutiny. Amazon will acquire iRobot for $61 per share, about a 22% premium from the company’s stock price at market close Thursday. Shares of iRobot were up nearly 20% in pre-market trading Friday. RELATED: As Amazon vacuums up iRobot, critics call on regulators to pull the plug on Big Tech deals The deal marks Amazon’s latest investment in the smart home. The company is working on its own home robot, Astro, which debuted in September, and has an array of smart home technology products such as Ring cameras and Alexa-enabled devices. Amazon acquired Ring in 2018 for $1 billion, and bought mesh WiFi startup eero in 2019. There are existing connections between Amazon and iRobot: Alexa can control Roomba devices already, and iRobot uses Amazon Web Services. In addition to consumer robotics, Amazon is also developing robots for the company’s warehouses. Amazon earlier this year invested in Agility Robotics, maker of a bipedal warehouse robot called Digit. It acquired warehouse robot developer Kiva for $775 million in 2012. Ken Washington, who leads the Astro team as Amazon’s vice president of consumer robotics, made it clear that the company would be expanding its family of home robots, speaking in an interview with GeekWire at the company’s re:MARS conference in Las Vegas. However, it wasn’t apparent until now that the company would do that in part through a major acquisition. “Astro is our first consumer home robot,” Washington said at the time. “It’s not going to be our last.” With Astro, the company has embraced a vision for a multi-purpose home robot, able to conduct security patrols, dance, or deliver items to specific people around the house. iRobot has taken a different approach with Roomba as a single-purpose device. Founded in 1990 by researchers from MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, iRobot unveiled the Roomba in 2002. The company also sells robotic mops, air purifiers, and more. iRobot shares have fallen more than 40% this year. The company’s second quarter revenue, reported Friday, fell to $255.4 million, down from $365.6 million in the year-ago period. It blamed declining revenue on unanticipated order reductions, delays and cancellations from retailers, lower-than-anticipated direct-to-consumer sales, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The company’s GAAP operating loss grew to $63.9 million in the quarter, up from a $3 million loss last year. iRobot said it plans to lay off 140 people, about 10% of its workforce, as part of a restructuring. iRobot has 15.7 million customers (those who have opted-in to its digital communications), up 35% from the second quarter of 2021. The company’s CEO and chairman, Colin Angle, will continue leading iRobot following the acquisition. Perhaps there were earlier signs of Amazon’s interest in iRobot — CNBC reporter Jordan Novet recalled this Instagram post from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos back in 2018.

The company, which helps grocers manage food orders, confirmed to GeekWire that it laid off 43 employees due to “challenging economic conditions.” It didn’t provide an updated headcount; the startup employed 200 people in September when it raised cash from a group of celebrities. According to LinkedIn, the company currently has around 150 employees. “Due to the current challenging economic conditions, Shelf Engine made the very difficult decision to reduce the number of positions at the company,” CEO and co-founder Stefan Kalb wrote in an email to GeekWire. “We are moving forward aligned in pursuit of our mission to reduce food waste through automation.” Amid the broader economic downturn, many companies are being advised to reduce costs and extend cash runways, which often means laying off employees. Seattle startups such as Convoy, Flyhomes, Rad Power Bikes, 98point6, and Esper all had rounds of layoffs this year. Founded in 2016, Shelf uses machine learning to streamline the ordering process for grocers stocking their produce sections, aiming to trim costs and reduce waste in the process. The company reported in September that retailers who use the platform can reduce food waste by as much as 32% while increasing profits. Shelf Engine makes money by marking up products it buys from vendors that it sells to retailers. In September, the startup said that it was being used in at least 3,500 U.S. stores, with large retailers such as Kroger, Target and Whole Foods, as well as the food service company Compass Group named as clients. It also opened a second office in Denver. Shelf Engine co-founders Bede Jordan (left) and Stefan Kalb. (Shelf Engine Photo) Kalb got the idea for the company through another startup he co-founded, Molly’s, which provides healthy food to hospitals, grocery stores, coffee shops, gyms and offices. Kalb noticed the difficulty of building efficient fresh food orders and decided to build software that helped Molly’s purchase the right amount of bulk food to fulfill customer requests. Kalb co-founded Shelf Engine in 2016 with Bede Jordan, a Microsoft veteran who was the principal software engineering lead for the company’s HoloLens team. The leadership team also includes Deborah Alexander, chief operating officer and head of finance. The company has raised around $60 million to date, including a $41 million round in March 2021 and a $2 million round in September led by celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Shaun White and Shawn Mendes. Other investors include General Catalyst, GGV Capital, Foundational Capital, 1984 Ventures, Correlation Ventures, Founders’ Co-op, Soma Capital, Firebolt Ventures, and Initialized Capital. Shelf’s post-money valuation in September was about $180 million, according to PitchBook.",

        "Extracted Article": "Seattle-based data storage provider Qumulo laid off about 80 employees Wednesday, or roughly 19% of its staff, in the latest round of job cuts affecting tech companies. In a memo sent to employees and obtained by GeekWire, Qumulo CEO Bill Richter cited economic conditions and getting the company to profitability as reasons for the cuts. Hundreds of tech companies are slashing staff amid inflation and the possibility of a recession. Venture capitalists are advising startups to cut expenses and extend their cash runways. Other Seattle startups including Esper, Convoy, and Keepe have laid off employees in recent months, in addition to larger companies such as Redfin and SAP. In an interview with GeekWire on Wednesday, Richter said Qumulo is not seeing a slowdown in demand from customers. But the company is now operating in a different macroeconomic environment, he said. “The two most important things are growth and profitability — not one or the other,” Richter said. Qumulo last raised capital in 2020 when it reeled in a $125 million Series E round at a $1.2 billion valuation, making it one of a handful of Seattle “unicorns” to eclipse the $1 billion valuation mark.

There are now more than 200 billion files handled by Qumulo for customers such as Telus, University of Florida, and others. The acceleration of cloud technologies during the pandemic contributed to record growth in its business, Richter told us on the GeekWire Podcast last fall. Qumulo had about 300 employees at the start of 2020, and then ramped up hiring, reaching a peak of 450 people. But some growth expectations “did not sufficiently materialize,” Richter wrote in the memo, and excess headcount “added organizational complexity.” “We must operate a lean organization, invest where there are clear and repeatable returns, and be honest about what’s not paying off or sustainable,” Richter wrote in the memo. There are now about 350 employees at the company following the job cuts, Richter said. RELATED: GeekWire’s 2022 layoff tracker Qumulo investors include BlackRock, which led the Series E round; Highland Capital Partners; Madrona Venture Group; Kleiner Perkins; and Amity Ventures. Total funding to date is $351 million. Richter, also a venture partner at Madrona, joined Qumulo in 2016. He previously was an executive at Isilon Systems, a data storage company that sold to EMC for $2.25 billion in 2010. Former Isilon employees Peter Godman, Neal Fachan, and Aaron Passey founded Qumulo a decade ago. Godman stepped down as CEO when Richter was hired, and left the company in 2018. Passey left in 2016 and was a principal engineer at Dropbox from 2017 to 2021. Fachan left Qumulo in April but remains on the board. Qumulo in May hired Kiran Bhageshpur as chief technology officer. Bhageshpur was CEO and founder of Igneous, which sold to Rubrik in 2020, and also previously worked at Isilon. Editor’s note: This story was updated to reflect that Neal Fachan left the company April 1.",

The company confirmed the cuts to GeekWire. It did not provide a number for total employees affected, or total headcount after the layoffs. Esper has more than 260 employees, according to LinkedIn, and employed 150 people when it raised a $60 million Series C round in October. “Today, as part of a company restructuring, Esper has reduced its workforce by 12%,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “Based on the current economic climate and projections for future access to venture capital, we made the tough decision to eliminate roles and reduce expenditures. It’s rooted in changing our plan so that Esper can operate with the funding that we currently have and achieve revenue targets that will sustain us beyond the next two years.” An affected employee who said he was promoted three weeks ago wrote on LinkedIn that the layoffs were made without email or call notification — “just locked out of my devices.” Update: An Esper spokesperson said “every affected employee was personally contacted to share this unfortunate news before system changes were made.” RELATED: GeekWire’s 2022 layoff tracker Esper is the latest tech company to slash staff amid an uncertain economy affected by inflation and other factors. Venture capitalists are advising startups to cut expenses and extend their cash runways. Founded in 2018 by Microsoft vets Yadhu Gopalan and Shiv Sundar, Esper helps companies with development, deployment, and maintenance of devices used across industries such as healthcare, education, retail, restaurants, and more. The idea is to beef up traditional mobile device management (MDM) software with modern DevOps capabilities. Insight Partners led the Series C round, which came shortly after the company raised a $30 million Series B round in May 2021. Other backers include Scale Ventures, Madrona Venture Group, and Root Ventures. Total funding to date is $100 million. Esper hired a new CFO, David Barclay, in April.

        "Extracted Article": "JetClosing, a 6-year-old Seattle startup that digitizes the home closing process for buyers, sellers, and realtors, is shutting down, GeekWire has learned. The company is closing June 15, according to an email viewed by GeekWire that was sent from a JetClosing employee to a customer. In the email, the customer was encouraged to take their business to another title company. GeekWire called JetClosing’s corporate phone number and reached a receptionist, who wasn’t able to provide comment when asked about the company’s shutdown. GeekWire has reached out to others at the company, and its investors, and will update when we hear back. The company, founded in 2016, was one of the first spinouts of Seattle startup studio Pioneer Square Labs and was part of a growing trend in real estate to shift the homebuying experience online. JetClosing used machine learning, cloud computing, and other technology to digitize the title and escrow process and eliminate loads of paperwork. Its competitors — incumbent title and escrow services — could do the same job, but JetClosing sold itself on being able to do it faster, cheaper, on mobile, and with more transparency. The company charged a flat escrow fee to both sides for each transaction and made additional revenue on issuing owners and lenders title insurance policies. It also helped homeowners refinance. The startup benefited from a strong U.S. real estate market as well as habits ushered in during the COVID-19 pandemic, where people relied more on digital tools to skip in-person meetings and complete home transactions from anywhere in the world. However, JetClosing was also battling larger incumbent competitors and a recent cooling housing market affected by rising mortgage rates. Some high-tech mortgage startups such as Better and Blend have laid off staff this year. JetClosing CEO Anna Collins. (JetClosing Photo) Economic uncertainty is also causing tech startups across various industries to trim expenses and slow hiring. JetClosing is led by President and CEO Anna Collins, who took over for original co-founder and CEO Daniel Greenshields last year. Collins previously led Bulletproof, the lifestyle company with a brain-boosting coffee product, as president and COO. She spent about six years at Amazon, including as GM of Worldwide Prime Membership, and also held leadership roles at PhotoRocket, Microsoft, drugstore.com, and aQuantive. Greenshields previously spent nearly 15 years helping run ShareBuilder, a company sold to Capital One (which later sold it to Etrade) that digitized and sped up the process of buying stocks, bonds, mutual funds, 401(K) plans, and more. “It’s a very consumer friendly product. We specialize in drama-free closing,” Greenshields said about JetClosing during an episode of the “GeekWire Elevator Pitch” in 2018. He envisioned a “massive expansion opportunity” at the time. JetClosing is licensed to operate in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. The company has offices in Seattle, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Austin and San Antonio, Texas. The company raised $20 million in a Series A round in 2018 and was nominated for Startup of the Year at the GeekWire Awards that year. It closed an $11 million Series B round in March 2021 and had raised $44 million to date at that time. The company’s investors included PSL Ventures, T. Rowe Price, Imagen Capital Partners, Trilogy Equity Partners, and Maveron. A year ago, JetClosing employed about 80 people. The company now has 65 employees according to LinkedIn.

Yet the Seattle company recently laid off employees as rising inflation and other macroeconomic factors are causing tech startups to cut expenses. Keepe CEO Rishi Mathew confirmed the cuts to GeekWire but declined to provide specific numbers. The company has 36 employees, according to LinkedIn. Keepe is the latest startup to slash headcount.

Mathew co-founded Keepe with his RealNetworks colleagues in 2016. The startup matches home repair technicians with property managers and other real estate companies that look after homes and apartments. It has raised $8 million to date, including a $5 million round last year. “We remain convinced that the B2B home services industry is ripe for disruption with the kind of value-added machine learning/automation-driven service that Keepe provides,” Mathew said. “The momentum we’ve experienced over the last 12 months is proof of that.”",

        "Extracted Article": "Convoy laid off 7% of its staff Thursday, becoming the latest tech company to slash headcount amid an uncertain economic environment. A spokesperson for the Seattle trucking marketplace startup confirmed the layoffs to GeekWire. Convoy said it employed 1,300 people in April, when it raised a $260 million investment round at a $3.8 billion valuation, so the cuts affected around 90 employees. “We have made a number of organizational and other operating expense related changes to ensure we are in the strongest financial position possible ahead of the potential for worsening economic conditions,” the spokesperson said in a statement (read in full below). A bevy of tech startups have laid off employees and larger giants are slowing or halting hiring altogether, with a number of macroeconomic conditions including rising inflation causing concern for companies across sectors. Venture capitalists are advising tech companies to cut expenses and extend their cash runways. Stitch Fix and Bird are among those that also announced layoffs this week. Even unicorn startups — those valued at above $1 billion — are not immune to market forces, including companies that just raised huge swaths of cash such as Convoy. Here’s the full statement from the Convoy spokesperson: “We have made a number of organizational and other operating expense related changes to ensure we are in the strongest financial position possible ahead of the potential for worsening economic conditions. As a result of these changes, we were sad to have to say goodbye to approximately 7% of Convoy’s workforce today. This decision was not easy, nor taken lightly. With our recent fundraise behind us and the continued intrinsic strength of our business we look forward to continuing to disrupt the freight industry for the betterment of truck drivers, shippers and the planet, whatever market conditions we encounter along the way. We will be opening up our networks to support departing staff in their efforts to secure new roles.” Founded in 2015 and backed by the likes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, Convoy’s software automates transactions between trucking companies and shippers. Its network has more than 400,000 trucks and a roster of shippers including Home Depot, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, and Anheuser-Busch. The company, ranked No. 4 on the GeekWire 200 list of top Pacific Northwest startups, said in April it expected to surpass $1 billion in revenue this year. Its revenue for the first quarter was up 51% year-over-year. It was just ranked No. 6 on CNBC’s annual Disruptor 50 list. Convoy is one of many fast-growing logistics tech startups — including several in the Seattle region — that have raised billions of dollars in recent years amid supply chain chaos caused by the pandemic as shippers dealt with market unpredictability and are turning to tech for help. RELATED: Q&amp;A: Seattle startups may be insulated from the downturn, and other insights from VC Chris DeVore Convoy competes with a number of similar digital-focused shipping companies including Uber Freight, in addition to traditional brokers investing in their own technology. They are battling for a share of a $800 billion U.S. trucking industry. Convoy is led by co-founders who previously worked at Amazon: CEO Dan Lewis and Chief Experience Officer Grant Goodale. They started the company by hanging out at truck stops and getting kicked out of warehouses as they did market research when Convoy was just a kernel of an idea. Former Expedia CEO Mark Okerstrom joined the company in August 2020 as president and COO. Former Cars.com CFO Sonia Jain just joined Convoy as its CFO earlier this year. In addition to its fresh venture funding, Convoy also landed a $150 million line of credit in April. Other investors include Baillie Gifford; accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.; Expedia Chairman Barry Diller; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; Code.org founders Hadi and Ali Partovi; former Starbucks president Howard Behar; U2’s Bono and The Edge; among others.",

The company employs more than 700 people. The cuts affected roles across product and recruiting teams, according to LinkedIn posts written by laid off employees. “I am saddened, frustrated, and genuinely blindsided by this decision,” one laid off employee wrote. “Beyond my frustration, confusion, and disappointment, I’m heartbroken,” another said. Dutchie is the latest tech company to lay off workers in response to the broader ongoing economic uncertainty. Several cannabis software companies have slashed staff in recent weeks, including Eaze and Akerna. Dutchie was valued at $3.75 billion when it raised a $350 million Series D round in October, which came just seven months after the startup raised $200 million. Dutchie also acquired Greenbits and LeafLogix earlier this year. The company serves more than 5,000 dispensaries across the U.S. with e-commerce, point of sale and payment products. It’s among a group of tech companies riding the wave of support for marijuana legalization in the U.S., including the passage of legislation across multiple states. Legal cannabis sales grew 40% to $25 billion in 2021. Dutchie’s backers include D1 Capital Partners, which led the Series D round, and others such as Tiger Global, which was featured by the Wall Street Journal on Monday in a story that described how the recent downturn “vaporized years of its gains.” Other backers include Dragoneer, DFJ Growth, Thrive Capital, Gron Ventures, Casa Verde Capital, Willoughby Capital, Glynn Capital, and Park West Asset Management. A Dutchie spokesperson provided this statement from Dutchie CEO and co-founder Ross Lipson, who started the company in 2017 with his brother Zach. “Like many other companies watching the dramatic market shift over the last few months, we took time as a team to carefully think through our business plans to ensure we are set up to fulfill our mission. Fortunately, the cannabis industry is still growing at a rapid pace and is positioned well to be resilient in the case of a broader recession. Last week, we gathered our entire team together to communicate an important and difficult decision to restructure a few areas of the business. This decision impacts approximately 8% of the company’s overall workforce. We are forever grateful for everyone’s contributions to Dutchie and the cannabis industry that were impacted.Dutchie is in a strong position and we are focused on continued growth. We will continue to hire top talent and pursue growth opportunities that map to our business objectives in order to advance our mission to provide safe and easy access to cannabis while helping to drive the cannabis industry forward.” Editor’s note: The story and headline were updated to reflect the percentage of employees laid off.",

Fewer than 100 positions were impacted, or less than 10% of the company’s corporate workforce. A spokesperson for Qurate Retail Group, which acquired Seattle-based Zulily in 2015, confirmed the cuts but did not provide specific numbers on jobs affected. “Last week, we announced to our team members some hard choices we have made for our organization to bring our operating expenses in line with our revenue and position our business for future growth,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Zulily employs more than 900 people in Seattle, according to LinkedIn. Zulily’s revenue decreased 38% in the first quarter to $232 million, Qurate reported earlier this month. Operating losses grew to $38 million, from $18 million in the year-ago quarter. “Zulily revenue decreased primarily reflecting product scarcity largely driven by supply chain constraints and marketing inefficiencies due to cost inflation and privacy changes on certain social media platforms, which caused Zulily to reduce marketing spend, affecting its customer acquisition and retention,” Qurate said in its earnings report. Zulily also took a $2 million restructuring charge in the quarter mostly related to its “regional office space strategy” and closure of a Pennsylvania facility later this year, which will result in 504 job cuts. The company also took a $396 million operating loss in Q4 due to a $363 million “non-cash impairment charge related to its tradename and goodwill.” We’ve followed up with Zulily to get details on the charge. Other e-commerce companies including Amazon are seeing growth slow following two years of online shopping surges during the pandemic. Inflation and supply chain woes are also impacting online retailers. UPS last month projected e-commerce delivery growth to cool. Zulily in March hired former Nordstrom exec Terry Boyle as president and CEO. Boyle replaced Jeff Yurcisin, the former Amazon executive and Shopbop CEO who took over in May 2018 for longtime CEO and co-founder Darrell Cavens. Zulily went public in 2013 and was acquired by Qurate for $2.4 billion in August 2015.",

The cuts affect employees who helped power the company’s mobile services arm, which is shutting down, including those on the ground and at the Seattle headquarters. Rad offered customers repairs at their doorstep via mobile services; it will now partner with third-party providers Velofix and Beeline Connect to continue offering mobile support. Rad sent a statement to GeekWire after we received a tip about the layoffs earlier Tuesday morning. “Rad Power Bikes is restructuring to bring more focus to our online and retail stores and expanding our footprint with additional retail locations this year,” a company spokesperson said in the statement. “We will be closing the majority of our mobile services business as part of our growth strategy moving forward. As we build future stores, we will expand into the areas covered by our mobile business and beyond. With this adjustment, we will be able to continue offering the best ebikes at the best price, in-store and also online.” Following the layoffs, Rad plans to hire 125 people this year to staff five new retail locations, adding to its existing stores in Seattle, Vancouver, B.C., San Diego, Berkeley, and Utrecht, Netherlands. It has also hired a new president and COO, Phil Molyneux, former president at Sony Electronics and Dyson America. He was most recently CEO at Wrethink. Rad continues to be led by CEO Mike Radenbaugh, a former director of product development at GolfBoard. The company’s co-founder Ty Collins stepped down last year.

(Rad Power Bikes Photo) Rad saw big demand amid the pandemic as more people bought e-bikes. The company is also riding tailwinds from climate-related trends as people and companies look to lower their carbon footprint. But like many other businesses, Rad has been dealing with supply chain issues. To help reduce delivery time, last year Rad bought 64 containers and worked closely with a logistics partner to charter its cargo into the Port of Everett near Seattle. Rad declined to share new revenue metrics. The company said it surpassed $100 million in revenue in 2019. The startup has more than 400,000 riders worldwide. It sells to commercial customers such as national pizza chains and food delivery companies, in addition to its consumer business. The global e-bike market is expected to reach $118.6 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. E-bikes are now a larger category than road bikes based on sales revenue, according to NPD Group. Rad’s bikes top out at 20 MPH and range from $1,199 to $1,999, across nine models. Other competitors including VanMoof have also raised capital in recent years to support demand. The company’s investors include Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company; Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley); Vulcan Capital; Durable Capital Partners LP; The Rise Fund (TPG’s multi-sector global impact investing strategy); and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Blue Nile and Zulily co-founders Darrell Cavens and Mark Vadon also invested in 2019.",

        "Extracted Article": "Adaptive Biotechnologies is laying off 12% of its workforce, or about 100 employees, GeekWire has learned. “We have made the hard decision to streamline our workforce,” a spokesperson told GeekWire. “Given current market conditions affecting Adaptive and the biotech industry more broadly, we needed to ensure we had enough flexibility to meet our medium- to long-terms goals.” The company had 858 full-time employees at the end of 2021, according to its annual filing with the SEC. Adaptive, which develops technology to assess the immune response, grew fast during the pandemic. The company doubled its workforce and signed up new partnerships with vaccine companies to help analyze and develop COVID-19 vaccines. Adaptive also rapidly developed and marketed a T-cell based COVID-19 test, increased sales of its kits to detect “minimal residual disease” in blood cancers, and has built up other biopharma partnerships. The layoffs also come less than six months after Adaptive cut the ribbon on a new headquarters in Seattle. But the company’s shares have declined about 80% from a peak in January 2021. Adaptive’s layoffs come as a hot biotech IPO market during 2021 cools down and biotech stock values decline. One key biotech index fund, the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF (XBI), is down about 50% from February 2021. Some other biotech companies have also been trimming staff, including Roche’s Genentech and Vancouver, B.C. and Seattle-area Zymeworks, which is laying off 25% of its workforce. Adaptive is undergoing a reorganization to focus on two key business areas, “minimal residual disease (MRD) and immune medicine,” according to the spokesperson. “As part of this process, we are deprioritizing projects and programs that are no longer aligned with the goals of the two business areas,” she added. The company’s revenue for 2021 was $154.3 million, a 57% increase from 2020, according to its most recent earnings report. Net loss came in at $207.3 million, up from $146.2 million in 2020. Fourth quarter revenue was $37.9 million, up 26% from the year-ago period. Net loss last quarter was $61.4 million, up from $44.6 million. At the end of last year, the company had $570.2 million available in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. CEO Chad Robins launched the company in 2009 with his brother, chief scientific officer Harlan Robins, and they took the company public in 2019. The company was spun out of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where Chad previously served as head of computational biology. Update: On Tuesday afternoon, Adaptive released a message that Chad Robins had sent to employees earlier in the day. “Ensuring we have the capital and the resources to fuel our growth while navigating turbulent market conditions has resulted in the need to make hard choices,” said Robins. After a comprehensive review, “it became clear that we had to cut operating expenses, deprioritize certain projects and programs, and make significant adjustments to expenditures on capital projects.” Adaptive’s long-time CFO Chad Cohen stepped down in January. The company will be making an announcement Wednesday morning about a replacement, “a significant part of our realignment,” said the spokesperson. “We are sad to being parting ways with our team members but believe these changes will set us up for success and growth,” the spokesperson added. “Our team is doing everything possible to support their transition, including a comprehensive exit package. The Seattle biotech market is intimate and our executives and remaining employees will be doing everything they can to help our departing colleagues network.”",
