        "Extracted Article": "Design software maker Autodesk said Thursday that it will lay off 1,350 employees, which works out to 9% of its workforce. The job cuts follow a series of large headcount reductions across the tech industry. In January, Meta said it would let go of 5% of its workers, and earlier this month Workday , which sells human resources and finance software, announced an 8.5% decrease. Google this week also announced cuts to its human relations and cloud divisions, CNBC reported , and PC maker HP said in a Thursday regulatory filing that it would reduce its headcount by 1,000 or 2,000, representing under 4% of total headcount. \\\"Our GTM model has evolved significantly from the transition to subscription and multi-year contracts billed annually to self-service enablement, the adoption of direct billing, and more,\\\" Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost wrote in a memo to employees. \\\"These changes position us to better meet the evolving needs of our customers and channel partners. To fully benefit from these changes, we are beginning the transformation of our GTM organization to increase customer satisfaction and Autodesk's productivity.\\\" The company is also conducting the layoffs to stay competitive in the current economy and protect the company's leadership in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, Anagnost wrote. San Francisco-based Autodesk will make facility reductions as well. But it will not close any offices, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email. It expects $135 million to $150 million in restructuring costs before taxes. The company on Thursday also announced better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results . The company delivered $2.29 in adjusted earnings per share on $1.64 billion in revenue, which was up 12% year over year. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had been looking for $2.14 per share and $1.63 billion in revenue. For the fiscal first quarter, Autodesk called for $2.14 to $2.17 in adjusted earnings per share on $1.600 billion to $1.610 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected $2.08 per share and $1.598 billion in revenue. Management sees $9.34 to $9.67 in adjusted earnings per share for the 2026 fiscal year, with $6.895 billion to $6.965 billion in revenue. The LSEG consensus was $9.24 per share and $6.902 billion in revenue. WATCH: The setup on key earnings this week: Salesforce, Autodesk and EOG Resources"

        "Extracted Article": "Google told staffers in its \\\"People Operations\\\" and cloud organizations this week that it plans to cut employees as part of internal reorganizations, CNBC has learned. The company will offer a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based, full-time employees in People Operations, Google's human relations division, starting in early March, according to a memo issued Tuesday by HR chief Fiona Cicconi that was viewed by CNBC. The latest cuts come after finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said one of her top priorities would be to drive more cost-cutting as Google expands its spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. After the company on Feb. 3 reported revenue that missed expectations for the fourth quarter , Ashkenazi said Google had strong demand for AI products and that it \\\"exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\\\" As part of the HR buyouts, employees who are level 4 and level 5 may receive a severance of 14 weeks of salary and one additional week for every full year of service, the memo says. Those are considered mid- to senior-level employees. Separately, the company also made cuts to several teams within its cloud unit, mostly affecting operations support staff, according to sources and separate internal memos. Some of those moves include moving roles to other countries. The company confirmed the changes to CNBC, saying reorganizations are part of the normal course of business. \\\"Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and ensure they are set up for long term success,\\\" Google spokesperson Brandon Asberry said in a statement. \\\"This work is ongoing as we continue to invest in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead.\\\" In January, Google executives said they would offer buyouts to U.S.-based employees in the company's \\\"Platforms and Devices\\\" unit ahead of expected cuts. That unit houses more than 25,000 full-time employees who work on Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit and Nest. The company said it is supporting all affected employees, in line with local requirements, including time to explore and apply to different roles at Google. Cloud cuts The Alphabet-owned company's cloud layoffs affected the unit's sales operations, customer experience, internal deal and go-to-market teams, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they are not permitted to speak publicly. Cloud is one of the company's high-growth business units and benefits from AI products. For the fourth quarter, the cloud unit's revenue increased 30% from the year prior. Alphabet has been drawing profit from the cloud business as it tries to keep up with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Some affected employees' roles are being relocated to India and Mexico City, according to people familiar with the matter and internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. The company confirmed that the changes include consolidating or opening roles in other parts of the U.S and overseas. The largest employee presence for the cloud unit is still in the U.S., and that's not changing, the company added. The number of layoffs is unclear, but the company said it is small in quantity and that the organization continues to hire for critical sales and engineering roles. Bloomberg first reported the cuts to Google's cloud division Wednesday. WATCH: Google reportedly to be hit with EU charges of infringing on Apple, Meta platforms"

        "Extracted Article": "LONDON \u2014 British digital remittances company Zepz is laying off dozens of IT workers and is in the process of closing down business units in Poland and Kenya. Roughly 200 staff members will be impacted by the redundancy measures, two employees who were made redundant told CNBC, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter. As of January, London-headquartered Zepz \u2014 formerly known as WorldRemit \u2014 had a global headcount of 1,000 people, meaning the redundancies affect around 20% of its total workforce. The layoffs affect several IT functions at the company, including database administration, development operations and software engineering, the former employees said. Zepz confirmed to CNBC that it was reducing headcount in order to \\\"sustainably support the next phase of long-term strategic goals and continued growth.\\\" The company declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by the layoffs, with a spokesperson explaining that the redundancy process was ongoing. \\\"Following the successful completion of its replatforming efforts, bolstered by advanced automation and AI, Zepz has embarked on a strategic initiative to optimise operations across the organisation,\\\" a Zepz spokesperson told CNBC by email. \\\"This transformation has reinforced the technology foundation and reduced the need for certain operational and technical capacities, prompting a proposed reduction in roles as part of the overall plan,\\\" the spokesperson added. Zepz has been touted as one of Britain's fintech darlings. The company was founded by Ismail Ahmed, a Somalia-born British entrepreneur who fled the country during the Somali Civil War. Ahmed today serves as the company's non-executive chairman. The group was renamed Zepz following the acquisition of money transfer platform Sendwave in 2020, with the brand and WorldRemit coming under one parent company. 'Difficult choice' CNBC obtained a company memo announcing the cost-cutting measures shared by Zepz CEO Mark Lenhard internally in January. \\\"Today we are announcing a very difficult decision \u2014 proposed reductions in our team across all HQ functions, and most regions. And specifically we are proposing the closure of our Kenya and Poland employing entities,\\\" Lenhard said in the memo. Zepz touts itself as a \\\"remote-first employer,\\\" with regional offices in Kenya and Poland. \\\"This is a difficult choice, which impacts the lives of our colleagues and friends. This is also a choice which is critical to the success of our mission to serve immigrants everywhere. Both facts are true, at the same time,\\\" Lenhard said. \\\"To be clear, this is not a change of strategy. We're doubling down on our mission in an effort to expand our impact faster,\\\" he added. \\\"In some places, this will mean we'll need to continue to ruthlessly prioritize. In others, we're going to get more efficient. In many cases it will involve rethinking how we do things today.\\\" Zepz's spokesperson insisted that the IT worker layoffs \\\"will not impact customers in any region or market,\\\" and added that the firm \\\"remains committed to its mission of serving migrants worldwide, driving innovation, and delivering meaningful financial solutions to millions globally.\\\" This isn't the first time Zepz has cut a spate of roles to save on costs. In 2023, Zepz laid off 420 employees , which accounted for about 26% of its global headcount at the time. Later that year, Zepz slashed a further 30 roles across its people and marketing functions. Zepz has long been touted as a potential IPO candidate, but a timeline for this is unclear. Counting the likes of Accel, TCV and Leapfrog as investors, the startup was valued at $5 billion in 2021. The company announced a $267 million funding round last year. Zepz faces competition from several notable digital payments players including PayPal , Wise , Revolut and Remitly.

        "Extracted Article": "Workday said on Wednesday it will cut around 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its current workforce, as the human capital management firm invests heavily in artificial intelligence to counter a softer macroeconomic environment. Shares of the California-based company jumped over 4% in premarket trading. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs are necessary to prioritize investments such as artificial intelligence, while also freeing up resources to expand the company's presence in different countries. The layoffs come at a time when the human capital management industry has grappled with slower spending by enterprise clients as high interest rates have pressured tech budgets. Workday expects to incur around $230 million to $270 million in charges connected to the cost reduction plan, of which, around $60 million to $70 million is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter. As of Jan. 31 last year, the company had around 18,800 employees. Workday faces stiff competition from other players in a crowded industry as firms consolidate their position through acquisitions to take market share. Last month, Paychex said it will acquire Paycor for $4.1 billion in cash, while Automatic Data Processing acquired management services provider WorkForce Software for around $1.2 billion in cash in October. Workday also said it expects its fiscal fourth quarter and full-year financial results to be in line with or above its prior forecast. The company forecast annual subscription revenue of $7.70 billion in November while it expects fourth-quarter subscription revenue to be $2.03 billion - in line with analysts expectations, as per data compiled by LSEG. Workday also said it expects to close certain office spaces that it owns and the actions associated with the cost reduction plans should be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2026."

        "Extracted Article": "Wayfair is exiting the German market and plans to cut as many as 730 jobs, or about 3% of its global workforce, as it looks to focus on new growth drivers such as physical retail, the company said Friday. About half of the affected employees will have the option to stay on with Wayfair if they agree to relocate to London, Boston or other locations where the company has a presence, finance chief Kate Gulliver told CNBC in an interview. The affected positions include corporate roles as well as roles on Wayfair's customer service and warehouse teams, she said. In a memo to employees shared with CNBC, founder and CEO Niraj Shah said it would take too much time and money for Wayfair to expand its business in Germany and the company's dollars would be better used for other growth initiatives. \\\"Scaling our market share and improving our unit economics in the German market has proven challenging due to factors such as the weak macroeconomic conditions for our category in Germany, the lower maturity of our offering, our current brand awareness, and our limited scale,\\\" wrote Shah. \\\"In our recent assessment, we concluded that achieving market-leading growth in Germany remained a long and costly endeavor, and one that is increasingly lagging the potential return we see in other areas. To ensure we align our resources with initiatives that can deliver the greatest impact, we made the difficult but necessary decision to reallocate efforts to areas with strong long-term potential where our current efforts are showing great progress,\\\" he wrote. Shares fell about 3% in early trading Friday. Germany, where Wayfair has been operating for 15 years, makes up a \\\"low single digit percentage\\\" of Wayfair's revenue, customers and orders, Gulliver said. The restructuring is expected to cost between $102 million and $111 million, which includes $40 million to $44 million in employee-related costs like severance, benefits, relocation and transition costs and around $62 million to $67 million in non-cash charges related to facility closures and other wind-down activities, Wayfair said in a securities filing. The company expects to make those payments over the next 12 months, but they are expected to be incurred across the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 \u2014 a six-month period set to conclude at the end of March. Wayfair expects to reinvest any savings from restructuring mostly across other core initiatives, such as its physical retail plans and its remaining international markets, it said in a securities filing. The company's guidance isn't changing, said Gulliver. Friday's layoffs are the fourth that Wayfair has implemented since summer 2022, but this move is less about cost savings and more about reallocating resources to initiatives that are actually making the company money, said Gulliver. \\\"We're not doing this because we're saying that we need some, you know, cost efficiency play, and so therefore we had to look for more costs and we identified Germany,\\\" said Gulliver. \\\"We see better ROI initiatives that we are already further along on that we can continue to invest in. So it's an investment prioritization, and [we're] going after areas like the U.K., Canada, etc. where we see a really exciting opportunity.\\\" Those initiatives include Wayfair's foray into physical retail , which began in earnest in May when it opened its first namesake store outside Chicago. Since the location opened, the company has enjoyed what Gulliver described as a \\\"halo effect,\\\" where online sales to customers who live near the store have increased. It plans to open another store or two in the U.S. \\\"in short order\\\" and also hopes to expand those doors to international markets such as Canada and the U.K., said Gulliver. \\\"Obviously, we want to nail it in the U.S. first,\\\" said Gulliver. \\\"But we are excited about the potential over time.\\\" Still, physical retail can be a massive capital expenditure. And Wayfair hasn't turned an annual net profit since 2020. Wayfair's decision comes as the company looks to boost topline growth in a sluggish housing market that has dampened demand for all things home. In the three months ended Sept. 30, sales fell 2% to $2.9 billion. \\\"It's always difficult to make a decision that impacts humans,\\\" she said. \\\"We care very deeply about the team there, and we're so appreciative of their work, but we do believe that this is the right next step for the business to allow us to focus on these higher ROI priorities.\\\""

Launched in 2016, Grabango was developing checkout-free technology that uses computer vision and machine learning to track and tally up items as shoppers grab them from store shelves. Will Glaser, Grabango's founder and CEO, is a longtime Bay Area technologist who cofounded music streaming service Pandora. The company employed roughly 100 employees, according to LinkedIn and Pitchbook. Grabango raised just over $73 million, Pitchbook data shows, with its most sizable financing round coming in 2021, before the market turned. In June of that year, Grabango raised $39 million in a round led by Commerce Ventures, with participation from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund as well as the venture arms of Unilever and Honeywell . In February of this year, Glaser told Axios the company had plans to go public \\\"in a couple of years at a $10 billion to $15 billion market cap.\\\" The IPO market has dried up since early 2022, with just three notable venture-backed companies debuting in the U.S. this year. The lack of liquidity has hammered the venture industry, making it harder for firms to launch new funds and for startups, outside of a select few AI companies, to raise capital. Based in Berkeley, California, Grabango was seen as one of the primary rivals to Amazon's cashierless checkout offering, called Just Walk Out. Other startups in the space include AiFi and Trigo. Grabango had inked deals with grocers including Aldi and Giant Eagle, along with convenience store chains 7-Eleven and Circle K. Amazon has targeted its Just Walk Out service to convenience stores and retailers in airports, stadiums and hospitals, among other venues. Amazon in April pulled its cashierless checkout technology from its U.S. Fresh stores and Whole Foods supermarkets. In a blog post following that decision, Glaser said Amazon's reliance on shelf sensor technology in its JWO system had \\\"proven to be its Achilles' heel.\\\" Glaser said Grabango eschewed shelf sensors in favor of computer vision which put it on a path for \\\"widespread adoption.\\\" \\\"This is a classic Tortoise and Hare parable, but with the players taking on surprising roles,\\\" Glaser wrote. \\\"The much larger Amazon lept to an early lead, but was unable to turn it into a sustained success. The more nimble Grabango, ironically, took the more difficult technical path, and is now reaping the benefits of its patience with a fundamentally more capable system.\\\" -- CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.

In an update published via its website, Northvolt said that following initial steps taken as part of a strategic review, the company had revised its scope of operations in Sweden \\\"to ensure that its resources are focused on accelerating production in large-scale cell manufacturing at Northvolt Ett.\\\" The strategic action requires Northvolt to reduce its global workforce by around 20% and a 25% reduction in Sweden, the firm said. It added that these measures were expected to result in the redundancy of roughly 1,600 employees, including 1,000 positions at its factory in Skellefte\u00e5 in the north of the country. The company said all redundancies would be subject to ongoing union negotiations. Northvolt, which currently delivers batteries from its first gigafactory Northvolt Ett in Skellefte\u00e5, said in March that it had over 6,000 employees. It had warned on Sept. 9 of the need to take \\\"some difficult decisions on the size of our workforce to match the needs of a reduced scale of operations.\\\" At the time, Northvolt declined to say how many jobs were likely to be affected. Alongside plans to lay off staff, the cash-strapped company said it would suspend plans for a sizable expansion of Northvolt Ett, noting the project had been intended to provide an additional 30 gigawatt hours of annual cell manufacturing capacity. The announced measures come as part of a broader strategic review and in response to what Northvolt described as \\\"a challenging macroeconomic climate.\\\" Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Northvolt is one of Europe's most valuable privately-held tech firms that builds lithium-ion batteries for the electric vehicle industry. It has partnerships with a number of major European automakers, including Volkswagen and Volvo . Peter Carlsson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Northvolt, said in a statement that the company needed to focus all energy and investments into its core business. \\\"While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate,\\\" Carlsson said. \\\"Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we're taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt's future,\\\" he added. \u2014 CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report."

The company, which operates the Citibike service in New York City and similar rental programs in other U.S. cities, had in July 2023 said it was exploring options for the unit after having received \\\"strong inbound interest\\\". \\\"We are discontinuing our dockless scooters in Washington, D.C., and are exploring alternatives for our dockless bikes and scooters in Denver,\\\" the company said.

The company does not operate its own bikes and scooters in many U.S. cities and has partnered with Bird and Spin, allowing riders to access them through the Lyft app. Lyft said it would incur about $34 million to $46 million in charges, largely related to asset disposal costs, and lay off about 1% of its nearly 3,000 employees at the end of last year. Cost savings from the restructuring, improved operations, and better sales strategies will help boost adjusted operating income by about $20 million on an annual basis by the end of next year, the company said. Lyft last month forecast a weak September quarter, raising concerns about the company's ability to cope with intense competition from Uber Technologies. CEO David Risher has slashed jobs, as well as rolled out enhanced driver earnings and new programs to drum up ride share demand since he took on the top role at Lyft early last year."

        "Extracted Article": "UiPath , a developer of automation software, is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 420 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring, the company said in filing with the SEC on Tuesday. Most of the layoffs will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company said. That quarter ends next April. UiPath shares dropped about 7% on Tuesday to close at $11.93 and have now lost more than half their value this year. The Nasdaq is up 23% over that stretch. UiPath has faced a dramatic slowing of revenue growth following its IPO in 2021, which was one of the largest U.S. software offerings on record. While UiPath reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, the company lowered its revenue guidance for the full year, and said it now expects between $1.4 billion and $1.41 billion compared with previous guidance of $1.55 billion to $1.56 billion. Its current forecast would equal annual growth of about 7.5%, down from 24% the prior year. UiPath makes software that automates repetitive tasks. The company announced in May that CEO Rob Enslin was resigning effective June 1, and would be succeeded by co-founder Daniel Dines, who had stepped down as co-CEO in January. That move drove the stock down 30% . UiPath said Tuesday that it expects to incur $15 million to $20 million in costs related to the layoffs, and total restructuring costs between $17 million and $25 million. The company previously announced two rounds of job cuts in 2022. \\\"These changes reflect efforts to reshape the organization by streamlining the Company's structure, particularly in operational and corporate functions, better prioritizing our go-to-market investments and focusing our research and development investments on artificial intelligence and driving innovation across our platform,\\\" UiPath said in Tuesday's statement. \u2014 CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed to this report.

        "Extracted Article": "Peloton announced Thursday that CEO Barry McCarthy will be stepping down and the company will lay off 15% of its staff because it \\\"simply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue.\\\" McCarthy, a former Spotify and Netflix executive, will become a strategic advisor to Peloton through the end of the year while Karen Boone, the company's chairperson, and director Chris Bruzzo will serve as interim co-CEOs. Boone most recently served as the CFO of Restoration Hardware while Bruzzo was a longtime executive at Electronic Arts . Peloton is seeking a permanent CEO. The company also announced a broad restructuring plan that will see its global headcount cut by 15%, or about 400 employees. It plans to continue to close retail showrooms and make changes to its international sales plan. The moves are designed to realign Peloton's cost structure with the current size of its business, it said in a news release. It's expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of fiscal 2025. About half of those savings are going to come from payroll reductions, while the rest will come from lower marketing spending, a reduced retail store footprint, and reduced IT and software spending, said finance chief Liz Coddington. The departments hit the hardest from the restructuring will be Peloton's research and development, marketing and international teams, Coddington said. \\\"This restructuring will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business,\\\" the company said. Peloton's shares surged more than 12% in premarket trading but opened lower after the company's conference call with Wall Street analysts concluded. Shares closed about 3% lower. Peloton board ready for its next CEO McCarthy took the helm of Peloton in February 2022 from founder John Foley and has spent the last two years restructuring the business and working to get it back to growth. As soon as he took over, he implemented mass layoffs to right size Peloton's cost structure, closed some of the company's splashy showrooms and enacted new strategies designed to grow membership. He overhauled Peloton's executive team, oversaw its rebrand and created new revenue drivers like the company's rental program. The last round of cuts, affecting 500 employees, was announced in October 2022. McCarthy later said the company's restructuring was \\\"complete\\\" and it was instead pivoting to \\\"growth.\\\" \\\"We are done now,\\\" McCarthy had said in November 2022 of the layoffs. \\\"There are no more heads to be taken out of the business.\\\" Contrary to Peloton's founder, McCarthy redirected Peloton's attention to its app as a means to capture members who may not be able to afford the company's pricey bikes or treadmills but could be interested in taking its digital classes. In a letter to staff, McCarthy said the company now needed to implement layoffs again because it wouldn't be able to generate sustainable free cash flow with its current cost structure. Peloton hasn't turned a profit since December 2020 and it can only burn cash for so long when it has more than $1 billion in debt on its balance sheet. \\\"Achieving positive [free cash flow] makes Peloton a more attractive borrower, which is important as the company turns its attention to the necessary task of successfully refinancing its debt,\\\" McCarthy said in the memo. In a letter to shareholders, the company said it is \\\"mindful\\\" of the timing of its debt maturities, which include convertible notes and a term loan. It said it is working closely with its lenders at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs on a \\\"refinancing strategy.\\\" \\\"Overall, our refinancing goals are to deleverage and extend maturities at a reasonable blended cost of capital,\\\" the company said. \\\"We are encouraged by the support and inbound interest from our existing lenders and investors and we look forward to sharing more about this topic.\\\" In a news release, Boone thanked McCarthy for his contributions. \\\"Barry joined Peloton during an incredibly challenging time for the business. During his tenure, he laid the foundation for scalable growth by steadily rearchitecting the cost structure of the business to create stability and to reach the important milestone of achieving positive free cash flow,\\\" Boone said. \\\"With a strong leadership team in place and the Company now on solid footing, the Board has decided that now is an appropriate time to search for the next CEO of Peloton.\\\" During a conference call with analysts, Boone said Peloton's board is looking for a leader who can \\\"architect and lead the next phase of growth for the company.\\\" Disappointing earnings, lowered outlook Also on Thursday, Peloton announced its fiscal third-quarter results and fell short of Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line. Here's how the connected fitness company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Loss per share: 45 cents vs. a loss of 37 cents expected Revenue: $718 million vs. $723 million expected The company's reported net loss for the three-month period that ended March 31 was $167.3 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with a loss of $275.9 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales dropped to $718 million, down about 4% from $748.9 million a year earlier. Peloton has tried a little bit of everything to get the company back to sales growth. It removed the free membership option from its fitness app, expanded its corporate wellness offerings and partnered with mega-brands like Lululemon to grow membership, but none of the initiatives have been enough to grow sales. For the ninth quarter in a row, Peloton's revenue fell during its fiscal third quarter, when compared with the year-ago period. It hasn't seen sales grow compared with the year ago quarter since December 2021, when the company's stationary bikes were still in high demand and many hadn't yet returned to gyms amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The business is continuing to bleed money and hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020. For its current fiscal year, Peloton lowered its outlook for paid connected fitness subscriptions, app subscriptions and revenue. It reduced its connected fitness subscription outlook by 30,000 members, or 1%, to 2.97 million as it looks toward its current quarter, which is typically its toughest because people tend to work out less in the spring and summer months. \\\"Our Paid Connected Fitness Subscription guidance reflects an updated outlook for hardware sales based on current demand trends and expectations for seasonally lower demand,\\\" the company said. Peloton now expects app subscriptions to drop by 150,000, or 19%, to 605,000. \\\"We are maintaining our disciplined approach to App media spend as we evaluate our App tiers, pricing, and refine the Paid App subscription acquisition funnel,\\\" the company said. As a result of expected downturns in its subscription sales, Peloton now projects full-year revenue to come in at $2.69 billion, a reduction of about $25 million, or 1%. That's below expectations of $2.71 billion, according to LSEG. However, the company raised its full-year outlook for gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. It now expects total gross margin to grow by 50 basis points, to 44.5%, and adjusted EBITDA to grow by $37 million, to negative $13 million. \\\"This increase is largely driven by outperformance from Q3, combined with lower media spend and cost reductions from today's announced restructuring plan,\\\" the company said. The quest to reach positive free cash flow Last February, McCarthy set a goal of returning Peloton to revenue growth within a year. When it failed to reach that milestone, McCarthy pushed it back and said he now expects the company to be back to growth in June, at the end of the current fiscal year. McCarthy had also expected Peloton to reach positive free cash flow by June \u2014 a goal the company said it reached early during its third quarter. It's the first time Peloton has hit that mark in 13 quarters. In a letter to shareholders, Peloton said it generated $8.6 million in free cash flow but it's unclear how sustainable that number is. Last month, CNBC reported that Peloton hadn't been paying its vendors on time , which could temporarily pad its balance sheet. Data from business intelligence firm Creditsafe showed that Peloton's late payments to vendors spiked in December and again in February after improving in January. The company didn't provide specific guidance on what investors can expect with free cash flow in the quarters ahead but said it does expect to \\\"deliver modest positive free cash flow\\\" in its current quarter and in fiscal 2025. \\\"While we firmly intend to return the business to growth, with today's announced cost reductions, we're lowering our cost base and we see a path to positive free cash flow without requiring a significant improvement in growth to get there,\\\" Coddington said on the conference call. \\\"I also want to clarify that we have carefully reviewed these cost measures to make sure that we do still have the capability to invest in innovation so that the business can grow profitably.\\\" Part of the reason why Peloton had failed to reach positive free cash flow is because it's simply not selling enough of its hardware, which is costly to make and has become less popular since the Covid-19 pandemic ended and people returned to gyms. \\\"Looking at the numbers in more detail, the biggest problem lies in the part of the business where Peloton first made its name: exercise equipment. Revenue for connected fitness products plummeted by 13.6% over last year in a sign that consumers are still cooling on equipment that, while aesthetically and technically pleasing, is very expensive,\\\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a note. \\\"A lot of people who want Peloton equipment already have it and are not likely to upgrade anytime soon; the balance of the market is either not interested or needs a lot of persuasion to buy into Peloton.\\\""

        "Extracted Article": "Just ahead of its blowout first-quarter earnings report on April 25, Google laid off at least 200 employees from its \\\"Core\\\" teams, in a reorganization that will include moving some roles to India and Mexico, CNBC has learned. The Core unit is responsible for building the technical foundation behind the company's flagship products and for protecting users' online safety, according to Google's website . Core teams include key technical units from information technology, its Python developer team, technical infrastructure, security foundation, app platforms, core developers, and various engineering roles. At least 50 of the positions eliminated were in engineering at the company's offices in Sunnyvale, California, filings show. Many Core teams will hire corresponding roles in Mexico and India, according to internal documents viewed by CNBC. Asim Husain, vice president of Google Developer Ecosystem, announced news of the layoffs to his team in an email last week. He also spoke at a town hall and told employees that this was the biggest planned reduction for his team this year, an internal document shows. \\\"We intend to maintain our current global footprint while also expanding in high-growth global workforce locations so that we can operate closer to our partners and developer communities,\\\" Husain wrote in the email. Alphabet has been slashing headcount since early last year, when the company announced plans to eliminate about 12,000 jobs , or 6% of its workforce, following a downturn in the online ad market. Even with digital advertising rebounding recently, Alphabet has continued downsizing, with layoffs across multiple organizations this year. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat announced in mid-April that the company's finance department would undergo restructuring, entailing layoffs and moving positions to Bangalore and Mexico City. The company's search boss, Prabhakar Raghavan, told employees at an all-hands meeting in March that Google plans to build teams closer to users in key markets, including India and Brazil, where labor is cheaper than in the U.S. The latest cuts come as the company enjoys its fastest growth rate since early 2022, alongside improving profit margins. Last week, Alphabet reported a 15% jump in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier and announced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion buyback. \\\"Announcements of this sort may leave many of you feeling uncertain or frustrated,\\\" Husain wrote in the email to developers. He added that his message to developers is that the changes \\\"are in service of our broader goals\\\" as a company. The teams involved in the reorganization have been key to the company's developer tools, an area Google is streamlining as it incorporates more artificial intelligence into the products. In February, Google announced a major rebrand of its chatbot from Bard to Gemini, the same name as the suit of AI models that power it. Alphabet is gearing up for its annual developer conference, Google I\\u002FO, on May 14, where the company traditionally reveals new developer products and tools underway during the prior year. Husain said in a memo explaining the developer changes that generative AI is at an \\\"inflection point.\\\" \\\"Recent advances in Generative AI across the industry, including Google's Gemini, are changing the very nature of software development as we know it,\\\" Husain wrote. In a separate email, Pankaj Rohatgi, Google's security engineering vice president, told his team, \\\"In order to optimize for our business goals, we are expanding work to other locations, which will result in some role eliminations and proposed role eliminations.\\\" The Core layoffs also include the governance and protected data group, which will be at the center of regulatory challenges facing the company, particularly as lawmakers across the globe focus more on developments in AI. The European Union's Digital Markets Act, which went into effect in March , aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices in tech. Evan Kotsovinos, Google's vice president of governance and protected data, addressed the upcoming changes last week. Kotsovinos in an email said the team's success means responding to \\\"escalating regulatory focus\\\" and is contingent on \\\"moving faster.\\\" Raghavan, Google's senior vice president overseeing search, recently referenced heightened competition, a more challenging regulatory environment, and slower organic growth as the company's \\\"new operating reality.\\\" When reached for comment, Google confirmed the Core reorganization and layoffs, and a spokesperson told CNBC that employees will be able to apply for open roles within Google and to access outplacement services. \\\"As we've said, we're responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,\\\" the spokesperson said in an email. \\\"A number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align their resources to their biggest product priorities.\\\" WATCH: Google alumni-led startups turn up pressure on top AI companies"

        "Extracted Article": "Beleaguered artificial intelligence startup Stability is laying off employees after the exit of its controversial former CEO Emad Mostaque. Stability, which is behind the popular Stable Diffusion text-to-image model, made more than 20 of its employees redundant to \\\"right-size\\\" the business after a period of unsustainable growth, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. The company's newly appointed co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte told employees in an email Wednesday night that the firm needed to \\\"restructure parts of the business, which will sadly mean saying goodbye to some colleagues.\\\" \\\"Those who are affected by this have been notified individually and we will be supporting them throughout this period,\\\" Wong and Laforte, who were previously chief operating officer and chief technology officer at the company, respectively, said in the internal memo. Stability AI's layoffs amount to about 10% of its global headcount, according to publicly available data online which shows the firm employs around 200 people in total. The employees affected by the measures are mostly on the operational side of the business and have been notified of their redundancies, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke with CNBC under condition of anonymity as they were not able to speak publicly on the matter. Last month, Stability announced its former CEO, Mostaque, was leaving the company to \\\"pursue decentralized AI,\\\" and would be replaced by Wong and Laforte. Mostaque's departure follows media reports throwing doubt on his credentials. A June 2023 Forbes report said that Mostaque misled people including his own investors about receiving a master's degree from Oxford University, as well as the nature of a partnership with Amazon which Stability characterized as a strategic deal but was nothing more than a standard cloud computing leasing contract. Mostaque's response at the time was that several of Forbes' allegations were \\\"false accusations and misrepresentations.\\\" He said he didn't receive his Oxford University degree because he didn't attend his graduation ceremony but had arranged to receive his degrees by post. He also doubled down on the deal with Amazon and it's cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services by describing it as a \\\"strategic business alliance\\\" that saw AWS build an \\\"incredibly rare dedicated compute cluster\\\" completed to the requirements of Stability. Stability AI is still searching for a permanent CEO to fill the top leadership role. The company said it continues to operate as normal and is still releasing new products, having only recently announced developer APIs, or application programming interfaces, for its Stable Diffusion 3 AI model. You can read the full memo from co-CEOs Wong and Christian Laforte below: Dear team, As you know, over the past couple of weeks the Leadership team have been working hard on a strategic plan to reduce our cost-base, strengthen support with our investors and partners, and enable our teams to continue developing and releasing innovative products. Following a review of the global team, we have determined the need to restructure parts of the business, which will sadly mean saying goodbye to some colleagues. Those who are affected by this have been notified individually and we will be supporting them throughout this period. These decisions have not been taken lightly and they are intended to right-size parts of the business and focus our operations, which is critical to setting us on a more sustainable path - and to put us in the best possible position to continue developing cutting-edge models and products. Products like the Stable Diffusion 3 API strengthen our deep-tech leadership and demonstrate our unique, systemic importance to the AI ecosystem. We will meet as planned on Thursday for our regular town hall and we encourage you to ask any questions you might have of our Leadership team in the form that will be sent out shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to discuss any concerns with your manager. We would like to thank everyone for their dedication and contributions. We recognize the challenges we face, but we have a plan in place. Through the hard work and commitment of this team, we are making progress every day, moving us steadily in the right direction. Best wishes, Shan Shan & Christian"

        "Extracted Article": "IBM on Tuesday told employees in its marketing and communications division that it's slashing the size of its staff, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Jonathan Adashek, IBM's chief communications officer, made the announcement in a roughly seven-minute meeting with staffers in the unit, said the person, who asked not to be named because the news hasn't been made public. In December, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told CNBC that the company was \\\"massively upskilling all of our employees on AI,\\\" after it announced a plan in August to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM said on its earnings call in January of last year that it was cutting 3,900 positions. \\\"In 4Q earnings earlier this year, IBM disclosed a workforce rebalancing charge that would represent a very low single digit percentage of IBM's global workforce, and we expect to exit 2024 at roughly the same level of employment as we entered with,\\\" IBM told CNBC in a statement. The latest cuts come alongside another round of downsizing in the tech industry. So far this year, some 204 tech companies have cut almost 50,000 jobs, according to the website Layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for layoffs since March, as Alphabet, Amazon and Unity all announced job cuts. IBM has returned to growth in the past couple years, but expansion remains muted. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 4% from a year earlier even as earnings topped estimates. CFO James Kavanaugh spoke of workforce rebalancing on the earnings call. The company has been trying to fit into the emerging AI narrative, which has been the big story across tech since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. In May, IBM announced WatsonX, billed as a development studio for companies to \\\"train, tune and deploy\\\" machine-learning models. The book of business for generative AI and Watsonx products doubled in size from the third quarter of 2023, when it was in the low hundreds of millions, according to IBM's earnings call in January. IBM faces steep competition in the enterprise AI realm. Microsoft , Google , Amazon and others have similar offerings, and IBM has long been viewed as falling behind in the AI race, particularly when it comes to making money from its products. \\\"I think that's a fair criticism, that we were slow to monetize and slow to make really consumable the learnings from Watson winning Jeopardy,\\\" Krishna told CNBC in December . \\\"The mistake we made was that I think we went after very big, monolithic answers, which the world was not ready to absorb.\\\" Nearly two years ago, IBM sold its Watson Health unit for an undisclosed amount to private equity firm Francisco Partners.

        "Extracted Article": "Electronic Arts announced Wednesday that it will cut 5% of its workforce, part of a plan that includes reducing office space and ending work on some video games. EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs. The company's announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry. On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent's Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce . EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is \\\"streamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.\\\" The cuts will support EA's \\\"strategic priorities and growth initiatives,\\\" according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be \\\"substantially complete\\\" by the end of December. \\\"We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,\\\" Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. \\\"We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.\\\" Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its \\\"biggest opportunities \u2014 including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.\\\" During the company's third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims. \u2014 CNBC's Steve Kovach contributed to this report.

        "Extracted Article": "Bumble on Tuesday announced plans to lay off about 350 employees as part of a restructuring plan. A company spokesperson said the cuts amount to about 30% of Bumble's workforce. Bumble said the layoffs will help drive stronger operating leverage and align its operating model with \\\"future strategic priorities,\\\" according to its fourth-quarter report . Bumble had more than 950 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2022, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The spokesperson said the latest annual report will be published later this week. The dating app reported $273.6 million in revenue for the quarter, up from the $241.6 million in the same period last year. Bumble posted a net loss of $32 million, or a loss of 19 cents per share, compared to the year-ago quarter, when the company reported a net loss of $159.2 million, or 35 cents per share. Shares of Bumble fell more than 8% in after-hours trading Tuesday. Bumble CEO Lidiane Jones said in a statement that the company is taking \\\"significant and decisive\\\" action to accelerate its product roadmap. \\\"We believe these actions will strengthen our foundational capabilities and enable us to continue delivering new and engaging user experiences that create healthy and equitable relationships,\\\" Jones said in the release. Bumble is the latest company in the tech sector to announce cuts in recent months, as investors continue to push for efficiency. Companies such as Google and Amazon have continued to trim headcount, and more than 170 tech companies have cut nearly 44,000 jobs, according to Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker.

        "Extracted Article": "Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares of Cisco were down as much as 9% in extended trading. It's the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay, Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi. In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here's how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected Cisco's revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement . Net income fell to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. The company has yet to close its $28 billion acquisition of monitoring and security software maker Splunk . Cisco now expects to complete the deal late in the first calendar quarter or early in the second quarter, CEO Chuck Robbins said on a conference call with analysts. Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. With respect to guidance for the fiscal third quarter, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue. For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue. The guidance excludes an impact from Splunk. Robbins flagged challenges weighing on the guidance during the call. \\\"In terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty,\\\" Robbins said. \\\"As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations.\\\" Demand remains sluggish among telecommunications and cable service provider clients, Robbins said. Cisco said it was increasing its dividend by a penny to 40 cents per share. \u2014 CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.

        "Extracted Article": "Instacart on Tuesday announced it would lay off about 250 employees, or roughly 7% of the company, as part of a restructuring. The news came as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell roughly in line with analysts' revenue estimates. Shares of the company fell 5% in extended trading. The layoffs are focused in part on middle management and creating a flatter organizational structure, according to Instacart, as well as focusing teams on larger projects, such as advertising efforts on Roku, Google Ads and more. Three top executives are also departing the company for personal reasons, according to Instacart: Chief Operating Officer Asha Sharma, Chief Technology Officer Varouj Chitilian and chief architect JJ Zhuang. Instacart will only backfill the CTO role. The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $803 million, roughly in line with the $804 million that Wall Street expected, according to analyst estimates from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. In September, Instacart went public in one of the first significant venture-backed tech IPOs since December 2021. In its prospectus, the company said it would focus on incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning features into the platform, and that it expected to rely on those features to \\\"drive future growth in our business.\\\" Instacart shoppers and drivers deliver goods in more than 5,500 cities from more than 85,000 grocers and other stores, according to its website. The business took off during the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers avoided public places. But profitability has always been a significant challenge, as it can be with much of the gig economy, due to high costs associated with contractor payouts.

        "Extracted Article": "Social media company Snap said Monday that it will lay off 10% of its global workforce , or around 500 employees, in part to \\\"promote in-person collaboration.\\\" The Snapchat maker's shares fell as much 3% in morning trading before paring back losses to close down 1.8%. The company has executed multiple rounds of layoffs since 2022, most recently in November , when it trimmed a small number of product employees. Snap expects it will incur charges ranging from $55 million to $75 million, according to a regulatory filing. The company's last major round of cuts was in August 2022, when it laid off 20% of staff and restructured its business lines. \\\"We are reorganizing our team to reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration. We are focused on supporting our departing team members,\\\" a Snap spokesperson told CNBC. The social media platform is the latest tech company to continue cutting in 2024. Nearly 24,000 tech workers lost their jobs in January alone. Already this month, cybersecurity and identity company Okta and Zoom have laid off staff. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, one of several social media executives to face scrutiny over the damage their platforms caused young people. Investors generally support tech companies' efforts to trim back headcount. Meta , for example, implemented a \\\"year of efficiency\\\" that saw brutal cuts to its workforce. The Facebook owner's stock reached an all-time high after it reported strong earnings and announced its first-ever dividend. Amazon and Alphabet have also pursued similar headcount reductions. Like Google and Facebook, Snapchat's revenue is highly dependent on digital advertising spend . The company has stuttered in some quarters, but managed to snap a streak of revenue declines in its most recent quarter. The company has also initiated a $500 million share buyback program. Snap stock remains below its debut price and well off its 2021 high of around $83.

Okta also reaffirmed its fourth-quarter and full-year guidance in a securities filing. CEO Todd McKinnon said in his message that the \\\"reality is that costs are still too high.\\\" Okta shares rose around 3.6% in premarket trading on the news. Okta is only the latest tech company to trim headcount in the opening weeks of 2024. Nearly 24,000 tech workers lost their jobs in January alone, even as many tech companies saw their stock prices continue to grow. McKinnon said the firm needed to be more \\\"thoughtful\\\" about where it was investing to achieve \\\"long-term success.\\\" The firm underwent its last round of layoffs in February 2023. It was a smaller round of cuts, affecting about 300 employees, and at the time, McKinnon said prior overhiring had led to unsustainable staffing levels. Read McKinnon's full message below. Hi Everyone, After a thoughtful FY25 business planning process, the leadership team and I have made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction impacting about 7% of our company, or approximately 400 people. If you work in the U.S., you will receive an email in the next 15 minutes notifying you if your role is impacted or not. If your role is impacted, your leadership will schedule a meeting today to discuss next steps. For employees outside the U.S. who have been identified as impacted or at risk, the notification process may be different based on local laws and practices. I know this is difficult news, and I'd like to provide some context on how we reached this decision. In order to grow profitably, we need to run the business with greater efficiency. While we've taken steps in the right direction, the reality is that costs are still too high. We need to be mindful of our overall spend so we can continue to invest in the areas, products, and routes to market with the most opportunity. To capture our massive potential and build an iconic company, we must be thoughtful about where we place our bets. This action is a proactive measure to help set the company up for long-term success. To the impacted employees, I am deeply sorry and we thank you for your many contributions. We are committed to supporting you during this transition and providing all possible resources to help you through this time. Impacted employees in the U.S. will receive transition support that includes additional time on payroll, the March RSU vest (if eligible), cash severance, extended healthcare coverage, job placement resources, and support for anyone on a company-sponsored visa. Outside of the U.S., our processes and severance will align with local laws and practices, including consultations with potentially affected employees, where appropriate, before any decisions are confirmed. Our priority today is managing this transition as respectfully as possible. As we navigate these changes, remember that Okta is critical infrastructure for 18,800 organizations around the world. We're looking forward to the work ahead with Okta in the right position to extend our leadership position and execute our vision to free everyone to safely use any technology.

The company confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the company's workforce. \\\"We regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy,\\\" a Zoom spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. \\\"As part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.\\\" Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024. The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg . As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi . January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google said it's eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions. In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it's laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce. Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom's stock has stumbled. Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020. Last February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers , or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the \\\"uncertainty of the global economy,\\\" CEO Eric Yuan said at the time.

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon said on Monday it would not move forward with a planned acquisition of vacuum-maker iRobot , with the two companies saying in a release there was \\\"no path to regulatory approval for the deal.\\\" The Roomba maker also announced it would lay off 31% of its employees, around 350 people, and that its chair and CEO, Colin Angle, would step down effective immediately. Shares of iRobot fell 10% in morning trading on the news. The fate of the deal was plunged into uncertainty after The Wall Street Journal reported that the European Union would not offer regulatory approval. The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, launched a probe in July, saying that the proposed deal could result in Amazon hindering iRobot rivals from competing on Amazon's online marketplace. The commission argued that Amazon could delist or reduce rival products' prominence in search results or elsewhere. \\\"Our in-depth investigation preliminarily showed that the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot's rivals by restricting or degrading access to the Amazon Stores,\\\" Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice president, said in a statement. She added that Amazon's control over the marketplace \\\"could have restricted competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners, leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for consumers.\\\" \\\"We're disappointed that Amazon's acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,\\\" David Zapolsky, senior vice president and general counsel at Amazon, said in a release. iRobot said it would focus on margin improvements, reduce spending on research and development, and pause all work on \\\"non-floorcare\\\" products, including its air purifiers and robotic lawn mowers. \\\"The termination of the agreement with Amazon is disappointing, but iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better,\\\" iRobot's Angle said in a release. Amazon will pay iRobot a previously agreed upon $94 million breakup fee. The terminated deal, first announced in 2022, would have originally valued iRobot at roughly $1.7 billion. The robotic vacuum maker has a market capitalization of under $400 million, following Monday's news and prior reports that the EU would move to block the deal. In July, iRobot entered into a $200 million financing facility from the Carlyle Group, in order to fund the company's operations as a stopgap until the Amazon deal closed. Amazon declined to provide a comment beyond the release. Regulators around the world have moved to scrutinize large technology companies, citing potential anti-competitive effects. Amazon is also one of the subjects of a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into the investments and partnerships between Big Tech and artificial intelligence developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI. In Europe, both Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the EU's European Commission have delayed or halted several deals. Those include Meta 's acquisition of Giphy, Adobe 's terminated acquisition of Figma and Microsoft's investment in OpenAI , as well as Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard . \u2014 CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed reporting.

The German software company said in a statement that its headcount should remain the same at year end. SAP had about 108,000 full-time employees at the end of 2023, meaning that the restructuring will affect over 7% of the workforce. SAP shares were up about 5% in extended trading. The stock jumped about 50% last year, its best performance since 2012, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 43%. SAP is aiming to reposition itself for faster growth, in part from artificial intelligence after revenue increased 5% year over year in the fourth quarter. Higher interest rates and concerns about the economy have hurt tech spending and led to layoffs across the industry, starting in late 2022. A year ago SAP said it would get rid of 3,000 roles . The downsizing trend has continued to start 2024, with companies including Alphabet and Amazon announcing layoffs this month. SAP said it now expects 10 billion euros ($10.85 billion) in 2025 adjusted operating profit. That's down 2 billion euros from its previous outlook because of share-based compensation, but up by 500 million euros due to planned efficiencies from the restructuring. CEO Christian Klein has been working to make SAP more cloud-centric, following similar shifts at Adobe , Microsoft and Oracle . Klein joined SAP in 1999. In 2019 he was named co-CEO with Jennifer Morgan to replace Bill McDermott, and in 2020 Klein became sole CEO. About 44% of SAP's fourth-quarter revenue, totaling 8.47 billion euros, came from cloud services, up from 25% in 2019. That was above the consensus of 8.33 billion euros among analysts polled by LSEG. WATCH: SAP CEO says 2024 will be year AI moves from discovery to execution"

The stock rose more than 3% in extended trading. Jamie Iannone, eBay's CEO, told employees in a letter published on a corporate blog , that the company will also \\\"scale back the number of contracts we have within our alternate workforce over the coming months.\\\" Iannone said the job cuts are necessary because eBay's \\\"overall headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business.\\\" \\\"To address this, we're implementing organizational changes that align and consolidate certain teams to improve the end-to-end experience, and better meet the needs of our customers around the world,\\\" Iannone said. \\\"Shortly, we will begin notifying those employees whose roles have been eliminated and entering into a consultation process in areas where required.\\\" Following hefty job cuts last year, tech companies have continued to eliminate positions in January as concerns about consumer and business spending persist.

During a call with analysts, Iannone said that eBay had \\\"observed softening consumer trends to date in Q4, and particular challenges in Europe, suggesting we may see a more muted seasonal uptick over the holidays.\\\" He added that \\\"Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and pressured demand for discretionary goods,\\\" Iannone said on the earnings call.

        "Extracted Article": "Wayfair is cutting 13% of its global workforce as the digital home goods retailer continues its efforts to trim down its structure, cut out layers of management and reduce costs after going \\\"overboard\\\" with corporate hiring during the Covid pandemic, it announced Friday. The company plans to lay off around 1,650 employees, including 19% of its corporate team, with a focus on people in management and leadership positions, Wayfair said. The restructuring \u2013 the third Wayfair has implemented since summer 2022 \u2013 is expected to save the company about $280 million, it said. Shares of Wayfair surged 10% on Friday after the news was announced. \\\"The changes announced today reflect a return to our core principles on resource allocation,\\\" Wayfair's co-founder and CEO, Niraj Shah, said in a statement. \\\"Although persistent category weakness makes revenue growth challenging, we remain encouraged by the share gains we continue to see.\\\" The layoffs come after Hasbro , Etsy and Macy's all announced cuts to their workforces as retailers contend with slowing demand and an uncertain economy. At the height of the holiday shopping season in mid-December, Hasbro and Etsy announced staff reductions of 1,100 and 225 workers, respectively, and on Thursday, Macy's said it plans to cut more than 2,300 employees , or 3.5% of its workforce. The department store retailer also has plans to close five stores. Wayfair said the cuts were not related to fourth-quarter performance but were rather a proactive move to get the company back to its core structure. During the pandemic, Wayfair saw its business explode as stuck-at-home consumers used stimulus dollars and savings to splurge on home goods like furniture and decor. It saw annualized sales go from $9 billion to $18 billion \\\"almost overnight\\\" and needed to boost its headcount to meet the demand, Shah said in a memo to employees Friday. However, as the virus' impact began to wane, the home goods sector overall started to see a pullback in demand. As a result, Wayfair has needed to make cuts to ensure its staffing levels are proportionate to how much business it's doing. \\\"By mid 2022 it was clear we were in a bust period. It was also clear that we had gone overboard with corporate hiring during Covid,\\\" Shah said. \\\"As everyone here knows, we've had two significant corporate restructurings since 2022 to try to right-size this. Each time we used our best judgment, identified the cost target we needed to hit, and believed we were resizing to the right point. \\\"After each reduction we have gotten more of our goals done faster. I believe we need to stay focused as a company on what committed small teams can accomplish. In many ways, having too many great people is worse than having too few,\\\" he said. \\\"With too few, you get a lot done quickly, but you may not get everything done that you want. But having too many causes inefficiency, coordination costs, and investments in lower return activities. That is what we have been experiencing and what we need to end.\\\" In the latest reductions, the company sought to eliminate senior people in certain areas who had \\\"too much time\\\" and spent that time meeting with other senior leaders instead of actually executing, it said. Wayfair also wants to rightsize the ratio of engineers to engineer partners, such as those in business, product, design, research and analytics roles, because an excess of those positions doesn't \\\"create better technology outcomes and rather will do the opposite,\\\" Shah said. \\\"We are gaining forward momentum due to everyone's dedicated efforts. Our toughest stretch is now behind us. And I think our best year is right in front of us,\\\" Shah said. The company does plan to rebuild portions of its headcount throughout the year but will focus on lower-ranking jobs and positions that execute on actions, rather than leadership roles that oversee those actions, the company said. If revenue remains flat this year for Wayfair, the company expects it will bring in $600 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2024, up from a previous expectation of $450 million.

The cuts affect fewer than 5% of staff in the Buy with Prime division, Amazon said. Buy with Prime is a service that lets online stores offer the same two-day shipping benefits available to Prime subscribers. Amazon has expanded the program since its launch in April 2022, including tie-ups with Shopify and Salesforce . Amazon didn't say how many staffers are in its Buy with Prime segment. \\\"We regularly review the structure of our teams and make adjustments based on the needs of the business and, following a recent review, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles on our Buy with Prime team,\\\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said Buy with Prime remains \\\"a top priority for Amazon\\\" and the company plans to continue investing \\\"significant resources\\\" in the program. Some of the affected employees worked in Amazon's multichannel fulfillment unit, which sits alongside Buy with Prime under the \\\"Project Santos\\\" organization, overseen by Peter Larsen, a longtime vice president at the company, a person with knowledge of the cuts said. Multichannel fulfillment allows merchants to ship and store products using Amazon's services regardless of whether they're selling on the home site. Amazon has cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company as part of rolling layoffs that began in late 2022. Job reductions have continued this year, with Amazon letting go staffers in its Prime Video , MGM, Twitch, Audible and Amazon Pay units last week. Other tech companies including Google , Discord, Xerox and Unity have also announced layoffs since the start of the new year. Amazon said it's assisting Buy with Prime employees who were laid off in finding new roles elsewhere within the company. Employees will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.

        "Extracted Article": "Etsy is laying off 11% of its workforce at the height of the holiday season as the e-commerce giant looks to restructure its business and streamline costs against a \\\"very challenging\\\" macro and competitive environment, the company announced Wednesday. Approximately 225 employees will be cut from Etsy's workforce, which will bring the headcount for the core Etsy marketplace to about 1,770 people, similar to the company's headcount in early 2022 and above 2020 levels. Etsy CEO Josh Silverman noted in a letter to employees that Etsy's marketplace \u2014 known for selling handmade items and connecting buyers with local artisans across the globe \u2014 has more than doubled in size since 2019 but said today's realities call for sweeping changes. \\\"We are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and [gross merchandise sales] has remained essentially flat since 2021,\\\" the letter reads. \\\"This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them. At the same time, employee expenses have grown, even as we have introduced significant cost-cutting measures and adjusted or paused hiring plans. This is ultimately not a sustainable trajectory and we must change it.\\\" The news comes alongside updated fourth-quarter guidance for Etsy. The company now expects gross merchandise sales to decline between 1% and 2% during the period from the year-ago quarter and revenue to increase between 2% and 3%. It's expecting adjusted EBITDA margin of between 27% and 28%, up from previous guidance of 26% to 27%. Shares of Etsy closed 2% lower following the announcement, after falling as much as 7% earlier in the day. \\\"Etsy is intensely focused on reigniting growth, driving sales for our nearly 7 million sellers around the world, and delivering value to all of our stakeholders. Today, we announced that we are reorganizing our internal structure so that we can double down on these efforts, which unfortunately means saying goodbye to approximately 225 of our colleagues,\\\" Silverman said in a statement to CNBC. The layoffs come two days after toymaker Hasbro announced it was cutting 1,100 employees as it grapples with soft sales that have continued into the crucial holiday shopping season. Hasbro had about 6,300 employees as of earlier this year, according to a company fact sheet . Etsy's layoffs will cost between $25 million and $30 million, the bulk of which will be used for severance payments, employee benefits and other related costs, the company said in a securities filing . Over time, the restructuring is expected to \\\"deliver meaningful operational efficiencies and cost savings and\\u002For cost avoidance,\\\" especially when it comes to salary costs and benefits. The restructuring is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2024. As part of the restructuring, Etsy's chief marketing officer Ryan Scott will be leaving the company and his position will be consolidated under the chief operating officer role, which is currently held by Raina Moskowitz, a former American Express executive. Etsy's chief human resources officer Kimaria Seymour will also be leaving the company and will be replaced by Toni Thompson, the company's current vice president of global people and talent strategy. Considering the layoffs come in the middle of the holiday season when many employees are shopping for gifts for their loved ones, Etsy said it would pay affected staff through at least Jan. 2, even though the last working day for most staff will be Wednesday. They'll receive severance of 16 weeks of base pay, plus one week for each full year of service, along with other benefits such as extended COBRA health insurance benefits and the ability to keep their company laptop.

        "Extracted Article": "Spotify shares closed up more than 7% Monday after the music streaming service said it is laying off 17% of its workforce, in a dramatic move aimed at reducing its costs and adjusting for a slowdown in growth. In an email sent to staff, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said that Spotify was taking \\\"substantial action to rightsize our costs,\\\" adding that the company took on too many employees over the years 2020 and 2021, when capital was cheap and tech companies could invest significant sums into team expansion. The latest round of cuts equates to roughly 1,500 jobs, according to a CNBC source familiar with the matter who preferred to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. A Spotify spokesperson wouldn't comment on the exact number of roles affected by the measure. \\\"Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business \u2013 one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future,\\\" Ek said in an internal memo that was shared on Spotify's website. \\\"While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.\\\" It comes despite Spotify reporting a 65 million euro ($70.7 million) profit for the third quarter, citing lower spend on marketing and personnel. Spotify raised the prices of its subscription plans earlier this year and has been expanding into podcasts and audio books. The latest round of redundancies follows successive cuts at the company, which like other growth-oriented tech firms has been forced to cut back on costs in the last year or so due to higher interest rates and a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. Wells Fargo analysts said Monday that the layoffs are likely a sign of Spotify's continued focus \\\"on achieving its profitability targets\\\" rather than a reaction to economic headwinds. They also noted that the headcount reductions could supply a nearly 2% reduction of operating expenses in 2024. Spotify cut 6% of its workforce , or about 600 employees, at the start of the year. The company then laid off 2% of staff, equivalent to roughly 200 roles, in June. Spotify shares have more than doubled this year. Here's the full memo Ek sent to staff earlier Monday: Team, Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business \u2013 one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future. While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities. This brings me to a decision that will mean a significant step change for our company. To align Spotify with our future goals and ensure we are right-sized for the challenges ahead, I have made the difficult decision to reduce our total headcount by approximately 17% across the company. I recognize this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us. For those leaving, we're a better company because of your dedication and hard work. Thank you for sharing your talents with us. I hope you know that your contributions have impacted more than half a billion people and millions of artists, creators, and authors around the world in profound ways. I realize that for many, a reduction of this size will feel surprisingly large given the recent positive earnings report and our performance. We debated making smaller reductions throughout 2024 and 2025. Yet, considering the gap between our financial goal state and our current operational costs, I decided that a substantial action to rightsize our costs was the best option to accomplish our objectives. While I am convinced this is the right action for our company, I also understand it will be incredibly painful for our team. To understand this decision, I think it is important to assess Spotify with a clear, objective lens. In 2020 and 2021, we took advantage of the opportunity presented by lower-cost capital and invested significantly in team expansion, content enhancement, marketing, and new verticals. These investments generally worked, contributing to Spotify's increased output and the platform's robust growth this past year. However, we now find ourselves in a very different environment. And despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big. When we look back on 2022 and 2023, it has truly been impressive what we have accomplished. But, at the same time, the reality is much of this output was linked to having more resources. By most metrics, we were more productive but less efficient. We need to be both. While we have done some work to mitigate this challenge and become more efficient in 2023, we still have a ways to go before we are both productive and efficient. Today, we still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing work around the work rather than contributing to opportunities with real impact. More people need to be focused on delivering for our key stakeholders \u2013 creators and consumers. In two words, we have to become relentlessly resourceful. I know you will all be anxious to hear the next steps about how this process will work. If you are an impacted employee, you will receive a calendar invite within the next two hours from HR for a one-on-one conversation. These meetings will take place before the end of the day on Tuesday, and while Katarina will provide more detail on all of the specifics, please know the following will apply to all of these bandmates: Severance pay: We will start with a baseline for all employees, with the average employee receiving approximately five months of severance. This will be calculated based on local notice period requirements and employee tenure. PTO: All accrued and unused vacation will be paid out to any departing employee. Healthcare: We will continue to cover healthcare for employees during their severance period. Immigration support: For employees whose immigration status is connected with their employment, HRBPs are working with each impacted individual in concert with our mobility team. Career Support: All employees will be eligible for outplacement services for two months. For the team that will remain at Spotify, I know this decision will be difficult for many. Please know we are focused on treating our impacted colleagues with the respect and compassion they deserve. Looking Ahead The decision to reduce our team size is a hard but crucial step towards forging a stronger, more efficient Spotify for the future. But it also highlights that we need to change how we work. In Spotify's early days, our success was hard won. We had limited resources and had to make the most of every asset. Our ingenuity and creativity were what set us apart. As we've grown, we've moved too far away from this core principle of resourcefulness. The Spotify of tomorrow must be defined by being relentlessly resourceful in the ways we operate, innovate, and tackle problems. This kind of resourcefulness transcends the basic definition \u2013 it's about preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity. Embracing this leaner structure will also allow us to invest our profits more strategically back into the business. With a more targeted approach, every investment and initiative becomes more impactful, offering greater opportunities for success. This is not a step back; it's a strategic reorientation. We're still committed to investing and making bold bets, but now, with a more focused approach, ensuring Spotify's continued profitability and ability to innovate. Lean doesn't mean small ambitions; it means smarter, more impactful paths to achieve them. Today is a difficult but important day for the company. To be very clear, my commitment to our mission and belief in our ability to achieve it has never been stronger. I hope you will join me on Wednesday for Unplugged to discuss how we move forward together. A reduction of this size will make it necessary to change the way we work, and we will share much more about what this will mean in the days and weeks ahead. Just as 2023 marked a new chapter for us, so will 2024 as we build an even stronger Spotify. \u2013 Daniel \u2013CNBC's Drew Richardson contributed to this article."

        "Extracted Article": "Zepz, the money transfer group that owns WorldRemit, made a fresh round of layoffs. The British fintech unicorn, which is backed by TCV, Accel, Leapfrog and other major venture capital funds, told CNBC exclusively that it laid off 30 roles across its people and marketing functions. \\\"Zepz has entered a redundancy consultation which will could affect less than 2% of its global headcount,\\\" a Zepz company spokesperson said in an exclusive statement to CNBC. \\\"Zepz values the contributions these colleagues have made to our company,\\\" the spokesperson added. \\\"As part of the redundancy package, all impacted individuals will be offered support via our Employee Assistance Programme, including coaching, counselling, and re-employment support.\\\" \\\"In line with our organisational values, our priority is ensuring all decisions relating to redundancies and restructuring are well-communicated and delivered with humanity while protecting the privacy of those impacted,\\\" the spokesperson added. That follows a separate round of layoffs the company embarked on earlier this year. In May, Zepz cut 26% of its workforce, citing duplication of roles that resulted from its acquisition of Sendwave, another money transfer service. Zepz hasn't been immune to the effects of slowing momentum in the digital payments space, which has forced companies to cut back on costs and, in several cases, lay off staff. The company reached profitability for the first time last year. Zepz said that, with this in mind, its focus is on \\\"innovation and continuous improvement for our users, delivering meaningful products that make finance more convenient and accessible to migrant communities.\\\" \\\"To fully realise our mission to unlock the prosperity of cross-border communities, we sometimes need to make tough decisions,\\\" Zepz told CNBC. Zepz has long been touted as an IPO candidate in the U.K., but its timeline on reaching that goal is currently unclear. The business was last valued at $5 billion, making it one of the largest and most valuable fintech companies in Europe."

        "Extracted Article": "Sierra Space, one of the sector's most valuable private companies, laid off several hundred employees and contractors this week, CNBC has learned. A Sierra Space spokesperson confirmed the company let go of about 165 employees on Thursday, but declined to specify the number of contractors affected. Former Sierra Space employees told CNBC that the layoffs included a significant number of contractors, with the cuts including hundreds of personnel in total. The laid-off employees received two weeks of paid non-working notice, plus four weeks of severance pay and health care benefits through the end of the year. Sierra Space had about 2,000 employees before reducing its workforce, the company spokesperson said. The Colorado-based company, which was recently valued at more than $5 billion, is pushing hard to fly the long-awaited first mission of its Dream Chaser spaceplane. Sierra Space this week shipped the first Dream Chaser, named Tenacity, for pre-launch testing at NASA's Armstrong facility in Ohio. The layoffs began soon after, the Sierra Space spokesperson said, noting the company conducted a surge in hiring this year to complete work on the Tenacity spacecraft. With Tenacity shipped, Sierra Space's spokesperson said the company is realigning to focus on the operations phase of Dream Chaser's first mission, as well as on classified national security work. The latter part of Sierra Space's realignment includes adding nearly 150 employees with security clearances from Sierra Nevada Corp., the aerospace and defense contractor owned by Fatih and Eren Ozmen , which the space company was spun out of two years ago. Sierra Space's spokesperson said the company is creating a national security space team to work on several classified contracts. Sierra Space also recently lost a pair of senior executives before the layoffs: COO Jeff Babione, who retired, and Senior Vice President of Space Destinations Neeraj Gupta. The company said the departures were unrelated. Two months ago, Sierra raised just under $300 million at a $5.3 billion valuation. Sign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter . Dream Chaser has been in development for years with a goal to deliver cargo and eventually crew to low Earth orbit as a reusable vehicle. It resembles a miniaturized NASA Space Shuttle in appearance and is built to launch atop a traditional rocket and land on a runway like an airplane. The first Dream Chaser launch was previously scheduled for late last year, but delays in the development of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket pushed back that timeline. Dream Chaser is planned to launch on ULA's second Vulcan mission, with the first Vulcan launch targeting December . Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station."

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon on Monday announced it will cut more than 180 jobs in its Amazon Games division, shutting down parts of the business that focus on streaming and supporting third-party games and putting more of an emphasis on developing its own titles, according to an internal company memo viewed by CNBC. The company will close its Game Growth and Crown Channel initiatives as part of the restructuring. Now, Amazon will focus on upcoming launches such as \\\"Throne and Liberty\\\" and \\\"Blue Protocol,\\\" as well as future initiatives such as \\\"Tomb Raider\\\" and \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\" games, Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, wrote in the memo to employees. \\\"I know this is difficult news and that the impact will be felt widely,\\\" Hartmann wrote. \\\"It never feels good to say goodbye to colleagues. This isn't a decision the leadership team came to quickly; it was the result of extensive considerations and road mapping for our future.\\\" Shares of Amazon closed down less than 1% Monday. The latest job cuts at Amazon come as CEO Andy Jassy has been in cost-cutting mode over the past year as the company has battled high interest rates and inflation. As a result, Amazon has carried out the largest layoffs in its history, cutting 27,000 jobs since last fall. The company also froze corporate hiring, and Jassy has looked to trim expenses in units across the company. In October, Amazon reported third-quarter earnings that suggested its cost cutting has been paying off. The company's revenue rose 13% to $143.1 billion in the third quarter, while net income more than tripled to $9.9 billion from $2.9 billion a year earlier. Hartmann wrote that after further evaluation of the Amazon Games business, the company decided it needed to focus its efforts and resources \\\"to deliver great games to players now and in the future,\\\" according to the memo. \u2014 CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report.

Splunk had nearly 8,000 employees as of January, according to its regulatory filings , meaning that around 500 employees will likely lose their jobs. The company laid off about 300 employees earlier this year . Splunk CEO Gary Steele said the firings \\\"are not a result of our agreement with Cisco\\\" in a letter to employees that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of the laid-off employees are located in the U.S., according to a concurrent filing with the SEC , and will receive unspecified severance and health-care packages. \\\"Within the next 24 hours, each ELT member will communicate with their organization to summarize any changes to their teams,\\\" Steele wrote. Splunk will incur about $42 million in restructuring costs, with most occurring before the end of April 2024. The company declined to comment on which teams would be affected or the timing of the layoffs shortly after the acquisition announcement, and referred CNBC back to its SEC filing. In September, Cisco announced it would acquire Splunk in an all-cash deal valued at $28 billion. The companies said the deal was expected to close by the third quarter of 2024. Shortly after the announcement, Steele and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the deal on a call with analysts. \\\"Together, we will become one of the largest software companies globally,\\\" Robbins told analysts.

An estimated 40 to 45 workers in Google News have lost their jobs, according to an Alphabet Workers Union spokesperson, who didn't know the exact number. A Google spokesperson confirmed the cuts but didn't provide a number, and said there are still hundreds of people working on the news product. \\\"We're deeply committed to a vibrant information ecosystem, and news is a part of that long-term investment,\\\" the spokesperson said. \\\"We've made some internal changes to streamline our organization. A small number of employees were impacted. We're supporting everyone with a transition period, outplacement services and severance as they look for new opportunities at Google and beyond.\\\" Google News presents links to articles from thousands of publishers and magazines. It's a popular tab for people who use Google search, allowing them to find top-ranked stories on a particular topic. The layoffs come amid a war between Israel and Hamas that has claimed thousands of lives in both Israel and Gaza since Oct. 7, and 20 months after Russia invaded Ukraine. Both wars have spawned a surge in the spread of misinformation across the web, heightening the importance of Google and other sites that users count on to find up-to-date news. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., on Tuesday asked for information on how Google; X, formerly known as Twitter; Meta ; and TikTok were trying to stop the spread of false and misleading content about the Israel-Hamas conflict on their platforms. European Union industry chief Thierry Breton demanded that companies, including Google, take stricter steps to battle disinformation as the conflict escalates. Breton specifically addressed letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, reminding them of the content moderation requirements under the EU's Digital Services Act. Google's spokesperson said, \\\"These internal changes have no impact on our misinformation and information quality work in News.\\\" Some tech companies said they've staffed up on content moderators as they scramble to battle misinformation. Meanwhile, Canada and other countries are eyeing laws that would force tech platforms to compensate publishers for their work. The cuts in Google News follow widespread layoffs across many parts of the company this year. In January, Google announced it was cutting 12,000 jobs, affecting roughly 6% of the full-time workforce. Last month, the company eliminated hundreds of positions from its recruiting organization. A staff engineer at Google News wrote a post on LinkedIn on Tuesday regarding the layoffs. \\\"These are some of the best and brightest people I've ever worked with,\\\" the person wrote. \\\"We're definitely worse off without them.\\\" WATCH: Google is the 'Magnificent Seven' stock that has the best catalyst Don't miss these CNBC PRO stories: This bank just hiked its 1-year CD rate to a fresh high A low-cost way to protect against an S & P 500 drawdown as risks escalate How to invest $1 million for the next decade, according to private bankers and wealth advisors This highly profitable industry is booming as the population ages Bank of America sees risks for employers as insurance coverage of weight loss drugs grows"

        "Extracted Article": "Supply chain software startup Flexport plans to cut approximately 20% of its global workforce as part of a new round of layoffs that's expected to begin on Friday, CNBC has learned. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen sent a note to staffers Thursday afternoon informing them of the job cuts, according to a copy of the memo viewed by CNBC. The company will inform employees of whether they're impacted or not via email beginning Friday morning, Petersen wrote. \\\"Today I have a difficult decision to share: We will reduce the size of our global team by approximately 20% with the process starting tomorrow, Friday, October 13,\\\" Petersen wrote. A Flexport spokesperson pointed CNBC to a company blog post from Petersen confirming the layoffs. The spokesperson declined to share Flexport's total headcount. The company employed approximately 3,500 people as of late September, according to Pitchbook data. The layoffs add to recent turmoil at the company since Petersen returned as CEO last month after abruptly ousting his hand-picked successor Dave Clark. Petersen claimed repeatedly that Clark, a 23-year veteran of Amazon , overspent and overhired during his tenure at Flexport. But documents viewed by CNBC, and sources close to Clark , showed that Petersen and members of Flexport's board helped implement decisions that Flexport has suggested were ill-advised. Since taking back the helm, Petersen quickly overhauled the company's top ranks, ousting several of Clark's key recruits, as well as its CFO and HR chief . He also rescinded 55 offer letters and moved to lease out unoccupied office space across the country. In the blog post, Petersen said following the cuts Flexport will be \\\"in a great position to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us to return to profitability as soon as the end of next year.\\\" The move will \\\"not impact the customer experience,\\\" Petersen added. He said the company is focused on the quality of its services like quote to invoice accuracy and shipment milestone accuracy. \\\"Today is a tough day, but we are a resilient, purpose-driven team that will overcome this setback and deliver on the promise of our mission of making global commerce so easy that there will be more of it,\\\" he said. Petersen wrote in the memo that employees in the U.S. and Canada are being directed to work from home on Friday unless they work out of a Flexport warehouse. Staffers based in Asia will be contacted about the layoffs on Monday, according to the memo. For U.S. employees, the company is offering nine weeks of severance, health care coverage through the end of the year, immigration support and job recruiting assistance, Petersen said in the memo. Staffers located outside of the U.S. will receive information about their separation packages at a later date."

The company had about 51,000 employees as of September 2022 , according to its last annual financial filing, so this would represent about 2.5% of that workforce. The semiconductor manufacturer notified the state Wednesday that it would be eliminating roughly 1,064 of its San Diego employees and 194 of its Santa Clara employees. The job cuts will take effect around Dec. 13 in both places, the filing said. Neither location will have any facility closures, the filings said. When CNBC contacted Qualcomm for comment, the company pointed to its last quarterly earnings report, in which it noted that it was expecting workplace reductions and related restructuring charges. \\\"Given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic and demand environment, we expect to take additional restructuring actions to enable continued investments in key growth and diversification opportunities. While we are in the process of developing our plans, we currently expect these actions to consist largely of workforce reductions, and in connection with any such actions we would expect to incur significant additional restructuring charges, a substantial portion of which we expect to incur in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We currently anticipate these additional actions to be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2024.\\\" Qualcomm's stock was relatively flat on the day."

        "Extracted Article": "Singapore-headquartered food delivery service Foodpanda on Friday confirmed to CNBC that it is conducting its latest round of layoffs as the need to be \\\"more agile remains critical.\\\" \\\"Our company priority right now is to become leaner, more efficient and even more agile. To do this, we need to streamline our operations so we can take on a more structured approach for the coming days,\\\" Jakob Sebastian Angele, APAC CEO of Foodpanda, said on Thursday in a letter shared with employees seen by CNBC. He did not mention the number of employees impacted nor departments affected. This is Foodpanda's third round of layoffs since job cuts in February and September last year amid macroeconomic headwinds, according to media reports. Grab and Deliveroo have also reduced headcount this year. \\\"While we already implemented some measures earlier this year, there is more we have to do to create the right set-up for our operations,\\\" said Angele. Those measures include reviewing organizational structure across both regional and country teams as well as shifting some functional reporting lines into different leaders for more consistency and focus, said Angele. The layoffs come as Foodpanda parent Delivery Hero is in preliminary discussions with potential buyers to sell part of its Southeast Asian food delivery business, the Berlin-based company confirmed with CNBC. On Wednesday, German media outlet WirtschaftsWoche reported that Delivery Hero is selling its operations under the Foodpanda brand in Singapore, Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Laos. \\\"Delivery Hero confirms negotiations with several parties regarding a potential sale of its foodpanda business in selected Southeast Asia markets. Any discussions or plans are in their preliminary stages,\\\" the firm told CNBC in an email, without mentioning specific markets. The German media report also said that competitor Grab could be a buyer. When CNBC reached out, Grab declined to comment on the matter. \\\"Grab's competitors whether Gojek or Foodpanda are losing market share. Grab is gaining market share in deliveries from Foodpanda who might even exit few markets in due course. Foodpanda is dis-advantaged due to its stand-alone delivery model,\\\" said Sachin Mittal, head of telecom, media and technology research at DBS Bank, in a Sept. 21 note. Grab is the leader in Southeast Asia's food delivery market, holding 54% of the region's gross merchandize value in 2022, while Foodpanda captured 19% and Gojek held 12%, according to a report from tech research firm Momentum Works. Tough operating environment Food delivery players are trying to stay afloat amid economic headwinds. Grab slashed costs in the past few quarters as the firm focused on profitability. Delivery Hero previously said that its \\\"focus remains on our long term commitment to building a sustainable, profitable business.\\\" Delivery Hero has yet to become profitable since its inception in 2011. For the first half of 2023, Delivery Hero reported a net loss of 832.3 million euros ($886.9 million), compared with a loss of 1.495 billion euros a year prior. Jonathan Woo, senior research analyst at Phillip Securities Research, said that Foodpanda potentially selling Southeast Asia businesses is \\\"typical market consolidation after intense competition, especially as scrutiny over profitability intensifies.\\\" \\\"Only a few market players \u2014 Grab, GoTo \u2014 in Southeast Asia could buy out Foodpanda,\\\" said Woo, adding that such an acquisition would be \\\"most appealing to Grab\\\" which is more entrenched in the region compared to GoTo or Deliveroo. GoTo is the combined company following a merger between Indonesia's Gojek, which operates ride-hailing and food delivery businesses, and e-commerce giant Tokopedia. In December 2021, Foodpanda announced it would scale down operations in Germany and exit the Japan market. Both Foodpanda and Grab have expanded to dine-in services as consumers resume their daily routines and go out and dine in more frequently."

        "Extracted Article": "Roku said it will lay off 10% of its workforce, or about 360 people, as the streaming software company looks to slash expenses. In a regulatory filin g Wednesday, the company said the cost-cutting measures aim to bring down its year-over-year operating expense growth rate. The company added that it expects adjusted third-quarter revenue of between $835 million and $875 million, up from a prior forecast of $815 million. In addition, Roku raised its third-quarter guidance for adjusted EBITDA to a range of negative $40 million to negative $20 million compared to a prior estimate of negative $50 million. Shares of the San Jose, California-based company closed about 3% higher Wednesday. The layoffs are part of an array of cost-cutting actions the company will take. Other actions include consolidating office space, slowing the pace of new hiring and reducing outside services expenses. Roku expects impairment and restructuring charges in the third quarter of up to $330 million, including a range of $160 million to $200 million related to office facilities, and $45 million to $65 million related to the job cuts. Moreover, Roku said it expects an impairment charge of $55 million to $65 million related to the removal of select existing licensed and produced content on its TV streaming platform, as part of a \\\"strategic review of its content portfolio.\\\" Roku anticipates the layoffs will be mostly complete by the end of its fiscal fourth quarter. The company had 3,600 full-time workers as of December 2022, according to FactSet. This is Roku's third round of layoffs over the past year as it scales back after a period of investment. The company cut about 200 employees in March and another 200 employees in November. On CNBC's \\\"Squawk on the Street,\\\" Jim Cramer said the layoffs and other cost-cutting measures should help the company pivot toward profitability and attract additional investors."

        "Extracted Article": "Niantic, a mobile games developer based in San Francisco, announced Thursday that it would lay off 230 employees as part of a reorganization. The privately held company will also cancel NBA All-World and stop production on a Marvel-based title that has not yet been released, according to a note from CEO John Hanke . It will also shutter a Los Angeles-based studio, where most of the affected employees are based. The move highlights how the mobile games industry has shifted in the years since Niantic landed its first major hit, Pokemon Go, in 2016. Since then, both Apple and Google' s app stores have introduced changes that prevent advertising tracking among apps, which has made advertising to gain new users more expensive and unpredictable. Hanke said the reorganization was due to both \\\"internal and external factors,\\\" including an overall global macroeconomic slowdown. \\\"In the years since Pok\u00e9mon GO's launch, the mobile market has become crowded and changes to the app store and the mobile advertising landscape have made it increasingly hard to launch new mobile games at scale,\\\" Hanke wrote. Niantic said Thursday that supporting Pokemon Go is the company's \\\"top priority.\\\" Overall, App Store spending on games declined 5% in 2020 to $110 billion, according to an estimate from Data.ai, a research firm. The move also signals a shift in the landscape for augmented reality applications, which can integrate computer graphics and data into the real world. Pokemon Go can display a digital monster interacting with the real world through a phone's screen. But the technology is starting to be integrated into headsets or goggles that use powerful cameras to integrate the real and virtual worlds, which many in Silicon Valley see as the next major computing platform. Earlier this year, Meta released its Quest Pro headset and early next year, Apple will release its long-awaited Vision Pro headset . Hanke's letter says these new hardware products validate Niantic's strategy, but that it's only an \\\"intermediate stepping stone\\\" to true outdoor AR devices, which likely will resemble a lightweight pair of glasses with transparent displays. \\\"We believe that we can build key content and platform services that will help realize the promise of this technological shift,\\\" Hanke wrote. Still, Hanke wrote, the AR market is \\\"developing more slowly than anticipated, because of technology challenges and because larger players are slowing down their investments in light of the macro environment.\\\" Niantic had 1,050 employees as of 2022 and last raised $300 million at a post-money valuation of $9 billion in November 2021, when tech valuations were at their frothiest peak, as per Pitchbook ."

In an email to employees Tuesday, Chris Phillips, who oversees Google's maps division called Geo, said the company is shifting its Waze strategy to include Google ads rather than using a separate ads system. That move will result in layoffs, according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. \\\"We have decided to transition Waze's ads monetization to be managed by the Global Business Organization (GBO), similar to Google Maps,\\\" Phillips wrote. \\\"Unfortunately, this will result in a reduction of Waze Ads monetization-focused roles in sales, marketing, operations and analytics.\\\" The company hopes to \\\"create a more scalable and optimized Waze Ads product,\\\" Phillips wrote, adding that it will \\\"wind down the current Waze Ads product while we focus on building new Waze Ads powered by Google Ads.\\\" Phillips said the company would be notifying advertisers and partners of the change on Wednesday, and told employees that his team will answer questions and share its plans for next steps at \\\"our next Waze Town Hall\\\" on July 11. The email didn't say how many jobs would be eliminated. The Waze unit has more than 500 employees, according to internal documentation viewed by CNBC. Google acquired Waze for about $1.3 billion in 2013. Following a year of dramatically decelerating revenue growth, Google parent Alphabet announced in January that it was laying off 12,000 employees , or 6% of its workforce. The company has also eliminated some projects, downsized others and said it's focusing on becoming more efficient. Since December, Google has been consolidating Waze with its own Geo unit, which oversees maps. As a part of the shake-up, the company announced then-CEO Neha Parikh would be stepping down. The Waze app uses a crowdsourcing technique that allows it to determine the fastest driving route from one location to another, with the most recent traffic information. Waze has roughly 140 million active users. \\\"Decisions like these are incredibly difficult,\\\" Phillips wrote. \\\"Each one of these Wazers contributed to Waze's success and culture, and I want to express my gratitude and respect for what they have achieved.\\\" A Google spokesperson confirmed the layoffs and other details of Phillips' email in a statement and said the company \\\"remains deeply committed to growing Waze's unique brand, its beloved app and its thriving community of volunteers and users.\\\" WATCH: Any weakness in search will throw Google's long-term growth into question"

Alibaba has begun informing staff of the layoffs and is also helping them to move to different positions internally if they desire, the same source added.

Last week, the company announced plans for a full spin-off of its cloud computing unit and said it intends for the division to become an independent publicly listed company. Alibaba aims to complete the spin off within the next 12 months. Alibaba's CEO Daniel Zhang has long-seen cloud computing as a key part of the e-commerce giant's future but it currently accounts for just 9% of the group's total revenue. And revenue has been slowing significantly over the last few quarters. In fact, revenue fell 2% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year.

        "Extracted Article": "Money transfer group Zepz is laying off 420 employees, the company told CNBC exclusively, as the fintech sector grapples with a tough macroeconomic environment. The London-headquartered company began informing employees of the job cuts on Monday, with individual staff being told by their managers before larger communications were issued. By Tuesday, the whole company had been told about the move. Zepz, which owns the WorldRemit and Sendwave brands, has a total head count of around 1,600, meaning the cuts translate to about 26% of its workforce. The reductions will mainly impact Zepz's customer care and engineering teams as Zepz looks to shift those operations from multiple countries to more centralized hubs, the company said. The firm is headquartered in London but has regional offices in the United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Poland, Kenya and beyond. Zepz said it was implementing what it called \\\"workforce optimization\\\" to account for roles that had been duplicated following its combination of Sendwave with WorldRemit under one parent company. Collectively, both money transfer services are used by more than 11 million users across 150 countries. Sendwave was acquired by Zepz in 2020 for an undisclosed sum. It is the second time in just under a year that Zepz has laid off staff. In June 2022, Zepz implemented job cuts affecting around 5% of its workforce, according to Sky News . Mark Lenhard, Zepz's CEO, said the decision marked \\\"an important and necessary step in transitioning from two vast, segmented teams to one dynamic organization under Zepz, and laying ambitious foundations towards our long-term strategic direction as a portfolio business.\\\" He added that the company took the decision to reduce its head count due to a need to streamline its structure rather than macroeconomic pressures. \\\"Over the last year we have taken a serious look at how to optimize the organization to continue scaling in a mature fashion that sets up the business for long-term success,\\\" he said. \\\"The remittance industry has maintained robust growth despite global economic conditions, and we've seen this audience take great measures to ensure their loved ones are supported as costs rise around the world.\\\" Employees will be offered support in the form of counseling, coaching, career and CV development, job applications, and interviewing skills. Despite the job reduction measure, Zepz said it is still hiring for 200 roles. The company enables users to send money abroad from a smartphone or computer with people on the other end being able to receive it in their bank accounts, by cash, to a mobile wallet, or as a mobile airtime top-up. The service is a challenger to established money transfer services like Western Union, touting cheaper fees and the ability to move funds rapidly. A close rival is Wise , which claims to offer cheaper international money transfers than the banks. Fintechs like Zepz are facing a range of challenges including more cost-conscious consumers and heightened regulatory scrutiny. These have hit the value of various companies in the sector \u2014 both in the public and private markets. Funding has dried up and several fintechs have taken valuation cuts. Even legacy banks have struggled to gain traction in the market, with Goldman Sachs recently pulling back on its fintech ambitions . Zepz last raised cash in August 2021 at a $5 billion valuation when it announced $292 million of new funding from investors led by the hedge fund Farallon Capital. The startup is backed by leading venture capital firms including Leapfrog, TCV and Accel. \\\"Having hit profitability last year, the Zepz team has been focused on efficient growth and continuing to build a large, sustainable business,\\\" Harry Nelis, a partner at Accel, told CNBC. \\\"Following the acquisition of Sendwave a couple of years ago, the next stage in the integration of the two companies is to remove the duplication of roles across the brands' locations.\\\" \\\"The team's decision to optimise the workforce, while a difficult one, was important for the business's long-term growth and we're confident Zepz will continue to disrupt the industry,\\\" Nelis added. Zepz has long been a darling of the U.K. fintech scene. It was founded in 2010 by British-Somalian entrepreneur Ismail Ahmed, who started the company after moving to the U.K. after fleeing civil war-torn Somalia. Ahmed's idea for creating Zepz, then WorldRemit, stemmed from his own experience moving money across emerging markets; he would transfer funds to his family, who then lived in a refugee camp in Ethiopia, but the transfers were expensive and took months to complete. Ahmed stepped down as Zepz's CEO in 2018, though he remains on the board as nonexecutive chairman. His successor at the time was Breon Corcoran, an Irish businessman who formerly led British betting company Paddy Power Betfair. In 2022, Corcoran was replaced by Mark Lenhard, a former executive at bill payments firm Bill.com, whose appointment reportedly came as the prospects of an initial public offering for the company had waned. Lenhard said that Zepz \\\"never announced a timeline for IPO and are not planning to announce exit plans at this time.\\\" The company achieved operating profitability in the first half of 2022, he said, adding it is \\\"on a sustainable track to increase profit margins.\\\""

        "Extracted Article": "DroneUp, a Walmart -backed startup competing alongside Amazon and others in the nascent drone delivery market, is cutting jobs across the company, CNBC has learned. The Virginia-based company began informing staffers of the layoffs Monday morning, according to two people who lost their jobs and asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Founded in 2016, DroneUp has a fleet of quadcopter-style drones that are designed to handle the last-mile portion of the delivery process, ferrying things like clothing, medication and food from warehouses to customers' doorsteps. The layoffs come as the tech industry continues to downsize and were part of the company's decision to focus more on its delivery hubs, a network of facilities for on-demand orders in the U.S. DroneUp is moving away from enterprise services like construction and real estate monitoring, aerial data capturing, and marketing, the ex-employees said. DroneUp confirmed the job cuts and the strategy change and said in an email that the layoffs hit \\\"a small percentage of the team,\\\" which now totals 418 people. \\\"After tremendous consumer adoption of our drone delivery services, we have made the decision to shift our business model to align our company structure around the continued growth and success of drone delivery and other drone services out of our Hubs,\\\" DroneUp CEO Tom Walker told CNBC in a statement. The company said that over the next six months, \\\"we will hire more people than were laid off.\\\" DroneUp is one of several startups racing to make drone delivery a reality. Within the past three years, DroneUp , Zipline and Flytrex have signed multiyear partnerships with Walmart to deliver lightweight goods by drone in as little as 30 minutes. At least 36 Walmart stores in the U.S. have the service, the company said in January. UPS , Amazon and Alphabet 's Wing unit are also in various stages of developing their own drone delivery services. Attempts at scaling commercial drone delivery in the U.S. have been slow moving, largely due to technical challenges and a lengthy regulatory approval process with the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency has authorized several companies to test drone deliveries in select markets as long as they don't pose significant safety risks. The economic downturn has also proven a setback for some drone delivery operators. Amazon in January laid off a significant number of employees from its Prime Air drone delivery unit just as the 10-year-old project prepared to begin flying packages to some customers in two small U.S. markets.

        "Extracted Article": "Ride-hailing app Lyft will lay off 1,072 employees, roughly 26% of its corporate workforce, and won't hire for an additional 250 positions, the company said in an SEC filing Thursday. The news comes a week after a memo from new Lyft CEO David Risher confirmed that the company would trim its head count . Lyft shares closed up around 1.5% Thursday. The company has around 4,000 employees and had already implemented a 13% head count reduction in November 2022. Risher's tenure as CEO started earlier in April. He has emphasized a need to streamline operations and get back to \\\"better meeting the needs of riders and drivers\\\" in employee communications and public messaging. Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer remain on the company's board, having led the company through its 2019 public offering and subsequent expansion. The company's stock has never risen above its debut price and remains down around 8% year to date. A focus on efficiency has been a familiar refrain from tech executives. The broader economic slowdown has hit tech companies particularly hard: More than 184,000 tech employees have lost their jobs in 2023 alone, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. A Lyft spokesperson referred CNBC back to the prior SEC filing and blog post."

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon will lay off 9,000 more employees in the coming weeks, CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff on Monday. The cuts are on top of the previously announced layoffs that began in November and extended into January. That round totaled more than 18,000 employees, and primarily affected staffers in its retail, devices, recruiting and human resources groups. Amazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs. It took into account the economy, as well as the \\\"uncertainty that exists in the near future,\\\" Jassy said. The company just wrapped up the second phase of its annual budgeting process, referred to internally as \\\"OP2.\\\" \\\"The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole,\\\" Jassy said. The latest round will primarily impact Amazon's cloud computing, human resources, advertising and Twitch livestreaming businesses, Jassy said in the memo. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy said approximately 400 people would be let go as part of Amazon's latest round of job cts. Clancy pointed to the economic downturn, and said Twitch's user and revenue growth hasn't \\\"kept pace with our expectations.\\\" Amazon is undergoing the largest layoffs in company history after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid pandemic . The company's global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Jassy is also taking on a broad overview of the company's expenses as it reckons with an economic downturn and slowing growth in its core retail business. Amazon froze hiring in its corporate workforce, axed some experimental projects and slowed warehouse expansion. While the company aims to operate leaner this year, Jassy said he remains optimistic about the company's \\\"largest businesses,\\\" retail and Amazon Web Services, as well as other, new divisions that continue to warrant investment. Amazon shares closed down 1% on Monday. Here's the full memo from Jassy: As we've just concluded the second phase of our operating plan (\\\"OP2\\\") this past week, I'm writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks\u2014mostly in AWS, PXT, Advertising, and Twitch. This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term. Let me share some additional context. As part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole. As our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don't have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we've prioritized allocating more resources). Some may ask why we didn't announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we've made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support. If I go back to our tenet\u2014being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers' lives and Amazon as a whole\u2014I believe the result of this year's planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we're investing. To those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It's never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so. Andy"

        "Extracted Article": "Business-software maker Atlassian said Monday that it will lay off 500 employees, or around 5% of its workforce. Atlassian shares were up 1% in extended trading following the announcement. The technology industry has been contracting slightly in the past year after Covid caused individuals and companies to change their behaviors, even as unemployment continues to be low in developed countries . Atlassian's competitors Alphabet , Asana , GitLab , IBM , Microsoft and PagerDuty have also announced job cuts in recent months, with central bankers seeking to tamp down rising prices by lifting interest rates. Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian's co-founders and co-CEOs, said the move is less about financial needs and more about focusing on key priorities such as IT service management and helping customers move workloads from on-premises data centers to the cloud. Cuts are not evenly distributed across the company, they wrote in a blog post . The company generated about $873 million in revenue in the fourth quarter , up about 27% year over year, although it ended the period with a $205 million net loss. Australia's unemployment rate in January was 3.7%, according to government statistics . \\\"While many teams across Atlassian are impacted, some of our most impacted teams include Talent Acquisition, Program Management, and Research & Insights,\\\" Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes wrote. \\\"We want to be clear these decisions are not a reflection of our teammates' work. Every single person has made contributions that have changed our company for the better and will leave a lasting impact on their peers and teams. This is about rebalancing the roles we need across Atlassian first and foremost.\\\" Employees whom Atlassian is cutting will receive 15 weeks of severance, plus one week for each year of employment, and they can keep their laptops. Friday will be their last day, a spokesperson told CNBC. Atlassian is based in Sydney. Australia's unemployment rate in January was 3.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to government statistics . The cost cuts will result in $70 million to $75 million in charges, according to a filing. WATCH: Lay off the layoffs: When do investors demand growth?"

The announcement came after the cloud communications software maker already laid off around 11% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan in September.

Shares of GitLab fell about 12% on the news. \\\"The current macroeconomic environment is tough, and as a result, companies are still spending but they are taking a more conservative approach to software investments and are taking more time to make purchasing decisions,\\\" Sijbrandij said in his message to employees. GitLab had 1,860 employees, according to PitchBook data. It competes with Microsoft 's GitHub and offers enterprise-level services for collaborative software development, counting Goldman Sachs , UBS , Nvidia , and Siemens among its clients. \\\"I had hoped reprioritizing our spending would be enough to withstand the growing global economic downturn. Unfortunately, we need to take further steps and match our pace of spending with our commitment to responsible growth,\\\" the CEO told employees. GitLab is offering severance that includes a single payout equal to four months of base salary and accelerated equity vesting, and it said it will pay health-care premiums for up to six months \\\"where possible.\\\" GitLab joins the ranks of tech companies, large and small, that have laid off staff in recent months, including Alphabet , Meta , Amazon , and Microsoft .

Shares of Zoom closed up about 9.8%. CEO Eric Yuan wrote in the blog post that as the world continues to adjust to life after the Covid pandemic , the company needs to adapt to the \\\"uncertainty of the global economy\\\" as well as \\\"its effect on our customers.\\\" Zoom experienced a huge boom during the pandemic when people were forced to work from home and turned to video chat software to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. \\\"We worked tirelessly and made Zoom better for our customers and users. But we also made mistakes,\\\" Yuan said. \\\"We didn't take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities.\\\" Yuan said the cuts will impact every organization across Zoom, and employees who are laid off will be offered up to 16 weeks of salary and health-care coverage. The CEO also said he plans to reduce his own salary for the coming fiscal year by 98%, and he is also forgoing his 2023 corporate bonus. \\\"As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today\u2013 and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions,\\\" Yuan wrote in the post.

For the period ending October 2022, Workday reported an increase of $228 million in \\\"employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation,\\\" which the company said was largely due to head count growth. \\\"While our confidence in the fundamentals of our business and future growth prospects remains strong, we continue to operate in a global economic environment that is challenging for companies of all sizes,\\\" the co-CEOs said in the message. The company intends to continue hiring throughout fiscal year 2024, the executives said. Employees who lost their jobs will receive three months of severance pay and an additional two weeks of pay for each year of employment. Stock vesting will continue through April 2023, and like many other tech companies that laid off workers, Workday executives said, the company will offer immigration support and optional medical benefits for six months. Severance packages for international employees would be \\\"similar\\\" to those offered to U.S. employees, Bhusri and Eschenbach wrote in the message. Workday went public in October 2012.

        "Extracted Article": "German enterprise software firm SAP said Thursday that it will be cutting up to 3,000 jobs, or about 2.5% of its workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to announce significant layoffs. \\\"We are further focusing our portfolio in areas where we are strongest to continue our accelerated growth,\\\" said Christian Klein, CEO of SAP, during the company's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call. \\\"This led us to announce today that we intend to carry out a very targeted restructuring in select areas of the company that will impact up to 3,000 positions and include a headcount reduction of about 2.5%.\\\" SAP shares were trading over 2% lower at 8:05 a.m. London time following the announcement. Responding to a question on estimated cost savings from the layoffs, Luka Mucic, CFO of SAP, said the company expects \\\"about 300 to 350 million euros [$327 million-$382 million] in run rate savings.\\\" \\\"We are guiding [the company] to double-digit profit growth in 2023 as we had always committed, but there will be only a moderate help from the restructuring program to those results,\\\" Mucic told CNBC's \\\"Squawk Box Europe\\\" in an interview following the announcement. \\\"What this is really about is a very targeted effort to further streamline our portfolio and concentrate investments on the areas where we clearly can have the most positive impact,\\\" he added. It comes after the company reported positive fourth-quarter results during the call. \\\"Our cloud momentum accelerated in the fourth quarter with S\\u002F4HANA [SAP's enterprise resource planning software]. Cloud revenue is also accelerating once again and growing at 90%. We also returned to positive operating profit growth of 2%,\\\" said Klein. \\\"For the full year, we met our guidance across the board with our cloud revenue rising 24%, up five percentage points from 2021,\\\" he said. He added that the company achieved this despite exiting from Russia and the ongoing global macroeconomic volatilities. Last week, Klein suggested that the firm would avoid having to lay off workers, as it is \\\"in a very strong position ,\\\" in an interview with CNBC. He added that he was broadly optimistic about the outlook for technology despite challenges posed by higher interest rates and supply chain disruptions. \\\"We in the tech sector, we at SAP, we are very confident about the year ahead,\\\" Klein said at the time. SAP weighs Qualtrics stake sale During the Thursday earnings call, Klein also said SAP was going to explore the sale of its stake in Qualtrics as \\\"we focus on our core.\\\" SAP currently holds 71% of Qualtrics on an undiluted basis. In Nov. 2018, SAP acquired American business software provider Qualtrics for $8 billion. Qualtrics subsequently went public two years later. \\\"We have had a very successful collaboration on the go-to market and technology front with Qualtrics and we absolutely will continue this,\\\" said Mucic. \\\"The move is meant to set up SAP to be able to focus on the core ERP [enterprise resource planning] categories and the surrounding categories that come along with it, while giving Qualtrics an even better ability to independently pursue its leadership and pursue the corresponding investments,\\\" he said. He added that Qualtrics is \\\"a pristine and Premier cloud asset\\\" and SAP \\\"should be able to command a very positive valuation for shareholders, but that remains to be seen.\\\" \\\"This would materially increase the profit performance of SAP that is currently not reflected in the outlook,\\\" he added, without revealing further details. Qualtrics announced Wednesday fourth-quarter results and revenue guidance that exceeded analysts' forecasts."

        "Extracted Article": "Cryptocurrency exchange Luno is the latest company in the industry to make layoffs, setting out to cut 35% of its global workforce. The London-based firm's CEO, Marcus Swanepoel, informed employees of the redundancies at 12 p.m. London time on Wednesday in a live-streamed town hall. \\\"2022 has been an incredibly tough year for the broader tech industry and in particular the crypto market,\\\" Swanepoel said in an internal memo which shared with CNBC Wednesday. \\\"Luno unfortunately hasn't been immune to this turbulence, which has affected our overall growth and revenue numbers.\\\" Luno has a total headcount of roughly 960, according to its LinkedIn profile, meaning that more than 330 jobs will be impacted. The cuts impact Luno's marketing teams in particular. A Luno spokesperson told CNBC the layoff measure would have \\\"minimal or no impact on key operating, and compliance teams.\\\" Luno, which has offices in Africa, southeast Asia and Europe, is part of the Digital Currency Group crypto conglomerate. The company will also be scaling back its U.S. and Australia operations, a company spokesperson told CNBC. DCG is one of several crypto firms caught up in the fallout from the collapse of FTX, formerly one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Genesis, the lending unit of DCG, filed for bankruptcy last week. Genesis' bankruptcy filing came after a standoff with one of its peers, Gemini, over a disputed lending agreement that generated rich returns for Gemini clients through Gemini's high-yield lending product, Gemini Earn. Gemini clients have $900 million stored on Gemini Earn. The service halted withdrawals after Genesis, which lent the funds out to large institutional borrowers, hit pause on client redemptions. The crypto industry has been mired in a downturn known as a \\\"crypto winter\\\" since the collapse in May last year of controversial algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve have also spooked market players. In the memo shared with employees Wednesday, Luno's Swanepoel said the industry had seen a \\\"series of shocks\\\" that led to a constrained funding environment and a shift toward long-term profitability. \\\"While we anticipated a downturn and proactively planned ahead with a business and funding model that can be resilient to some of these factors, the sheer scale and speed of all of this happening, and all at the same time, has put significant strain on our original plan,\\\" Swanepoel said. \\\"What this means in practice is that in addition to streamlining our strategy to focus on our core strengths, we need to also substantially decrease our cost base - which includes employee headcount in all of our markets - in order for us to be set up for success going forward.\\\" Roughly $2 trillion of value has been erased from the overall crypto market since the peak of the crypto boom in November 2021 \u2014 although bitcoin has had a bit of bounce since the start of the year. TerraUST's failure, coupled with deep declines in digital currency prices, sparked a cascade of further crypto failures, including Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, FTX, BlockFi and Genesis."

        "Extracted Article": "Supply chain software startup Flexport is laying off 20% of its global workforce, or roughly 640 employees, according to a memo from co-CEOs Ryan Petersen and Dave Clark. Petersen started Flexport in 2013 because he figured there had to be a better way to manage the flow of goods that get put on cargo ships, planes, trucks and railroads and transported all over the world. The company's freight forwarding and brokerage services are in the cloud, enabling it to analyze costs, container efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions quickly and with more accuracy than legacy systems. The company topped last year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list , as supply chain bottlenecks roiled the global economy and it raised $900 million from investors at an $8 billion valuation. But now the co-CEOs say the company is being challenged as higher interest rates around the world hit demand. \\\"While we are looking forward to what's to come in 2023, we must also make hard decisions necessary to set us up for long-term success. We are overall in a good position, but are not immune to the macroeconomic downturn that has impacted businesses around the world. Our customers have been impacted by these challenging conditions, resulting in a reduction to our volume forecasts through 2023. Lower volumes, combined with improved efficiencies as a result of new organizational and operational structures, means we are overstaffed in a variety of roles across the company,\\\" they wrote. Last year, the company announced that Clark, the former worldwide consumer chief at Amazon, would take the helm as CEO of Flexport on Sept. 1, replacing Petersen, who plans to transition into the role of executive chairman this March. \\\"As the economy recovers, we will be ready to be the Flexport that we all want to be\u2013the one stop for customers to make the movement of goods around the world easy. But to do that, we're going to need to be nimble, fiscally responsible and focused on building fast with operational excellence,\\\" the memo reads. The company said layoff packages will vary by geography, but for U.S. employees will include 12 weeks severance, 6 months extended health care, 2022 bonus payment, equity vesting acceleration including dropping the vesting cliff for those with 6 months or more of tenure, immigration support, and ability to opt into an alumni talent directory to help with future job opportunities. Flexport joins a long list of tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the Covid pandemic . Last week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs , more than the online retailer initially estimated last year, while Salesforce reduced its head count by more than 7,000, or 10%. Coinbase announced a 20% workforce reduction on Tuesday. Elon Musk slashed about half of Twitter's workforce after taking the helm as CEO last year, and Meta cut more than 11,000 jobs , or 13%.

        "Extracted Article": "Coinbase is cutting about a fifth of its workforce as it looks to preserve cash during the crypto market downturn. The exchange plans to cut 950 jobs, according to a blog post published Tuesday morning. Coinbase , which had roughly 4,700 employees as of the end of September, already slashed 18% of its workforce in June citing a need to manage costs and growing \\\"too quickly\\\" during the bull market. \\\"With perfect hindsight, looking back, we should have done more,\\\" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in a phone interview. \\\"The best you can do is react quickly once information becomes available, and that's what we're doing in this case.\\\" Coinbase said the move would result in new expenses of between $149 million and $163 million for the first quarter. The layoffs, along with other restructuring measures, will bring Coinbase's operating expenses down by 25% for the quarter ending in March, according to a new regulatory filing. The crypto company also said it expects adjusted EBITDA losses for the full year to be within a prior $500 million \\\"guardrail\\\" set last year. After looking at various stress tests for Coinbase's annual revenue, Armstrong said, \\\"it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario\\\" and there was \\\"no way\\\" to do so without reducing head count. The company will also be shutting down several projects with a \\\"lower probability of success.\\\" Cryptocurrency markets have been rocked in recent months following the collapse of one of the industry's biggest players, FTX. Armstrong pointed to that fallout, and increasing pressure on the sector thanks to \\\"unscrupulous actors in the industry\\\" referring to FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. \\\"The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,\\\" he said, adding there's likely more \\\"shoes to drop.\\\" \\\"We may not have seen the last of it \u2014 there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they're following the rules,\\\" Armstrong said. \\\"Long term that's a good thing. But short term, there's still a lot of market fear.\\\" Cryptocurrencies have suffered alongside technology stocks as investors flee riskier assets amid a broader economic downturn. Bitcoin is down 58% in the past year, while Coinbase shares are off by more than 83%. End of a growth era Coinbase joins a chorus of other tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the Covid pandemic . Last week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs , more than the online retailer initially estimated last year, while Salesforce reduced its head count by more than 7,000, or 10%. Elon Musk slashed about half of Twitter's workforce after taking the helm as CEO last year, and Meta cut more than 11,000 jobs , or 13%. Crypto companies Genesis, Gemini and Kraken have also reduced their workforces. \\\"Every company in Silicon Valley felt like we were just focused on growth, growth, growth, and people were almost using their headcount number as a symbol of how much progress they were making,\\\" Armstrong said. \\\"The focus now is on operational efficiency -- it's a healthy thing for the ecosystem and the industry to focus more on those things.\\\" Early last year, Coinbase had said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. Armstrong said he's now trying to shift the culture at Coinbase to \\\"get back to its start-up roots\\\" of smaller teams that can move quickly. Coinbase went public in April 2021 and has seen its share price plummet since. The stock is trading below $40 after surging as high as $429.54 on the day of its debut . Coinbase debt that's maturing in 2031 continues to trade at roughly 50 cents on the dollar. The company still had cash and equivalents of roughly $5 billion as of the end of September. Coinbase said it would email affected employees on their personal accounts, and revoke access to company systems. Armstrong acknowledged the latter \\\"feels sudden and harsh\\\" but \\\"it's the only prudent choice given our responsibility to protect customer information.\\\" Despite the industry's domino effect of bankruptcies and a marked drop in trading volume, Armstrong was steadfast in arguing that the industry isn't going away. He said the demise of FTX would ultimately benefit Coinbase, as its largest competitor is now wiped out. Regulatory clarity may also emerge, and Armstrong said it \\\"validates\\\" the company's decision of building and going public in the U.S. The CEO likened the current environment to the dot-com boom and bust. \\\"If you look at the internet era, the best companies got even stronger by having rigorous cost management,\\\" he said. \\\"That's what's going to happen here.\\\""

Genesis had already laid off 20% of its workforce and last year replaced its CEO. Silbert's crypto conglomerate, which includes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and mining company Foundry, was hit by the market tumult of 2022 and the bankruptcy of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. About 60 positions were eliminated, said the source, who asked not to be named because the numbers are confidential. The company now has around 145 employees. The latest reduction comes a day after interim CEO Derar Islim told clients that Genesis needed more time to solve its financial crisis. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the cuts. Genesis engaged bankruptcy professionals shortly after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research. The Wall Street Journal reported that Genesis had sought an emergency loan of $1 billion shortly after the implosion of Alameda, which was a major Genesis client. Genesis froze redemptions for all clients after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Silbert has come under fire as a result of the redemption freeze. Earlier this week, Cameron Winklevoss, a Genesis client and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, accused Silbert of engaging in \\\"bad faith\\\" stalling tactics and demanded a solution to the liquidity crisis at Genesis. He said DCG owes $1.675 billion to Gemini customers and other Genesis creditors. Silbert responded on Twitter by saying that DCG never borrowed $1.675 billion from Genesis and \\\"is current on all loans outstanding.\\\" Correction: An earlier version of this story has an incorrect number for total job cuts. It also mistakenly said Silbert was referring to Gemini instead of Genesis in the last paragraph. WATCH: Genesis suspends withdrawals"

        "Extracted Article": "Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake on Thursday told employees the company will be cutting 20% of its salaried workforce and she will reassume her post as CEO as the fledgling apparel company continues to grapple with low sales, a dwindling customer base and a reduced market cap. The brand's current CEO, Elizabeth Spaulding, who joined the company as president in 2020 and took over as CEO in August 2021 , will be stepping down effective immediately, Lake said. \\\"I will be stepping in as interim CEO and leading the search process for our next CEO,\\\" Lake said Thursday . \\\"Despite the challenging moment we are in right now, the board and I still deeply believe in the Stitch Fix business, mission and vision.\\\" Shares of the company surged roughly 9% Thursday after the announcements and its market cap hovered around $386 million. Shares closed more than 9% higher at $3.50. Stitch Fix, which sells curated boxes of clothing on a subscription basis, won big during the Covid pandemic after stuck-at-home consumers, newly flush with cash, took advantage of the service to update their wardrobes. But as shoppers ventured back out into the world, sales dropped and new strategies led by Spaulding failed . Shortly after taking over as CEO, Spaulding led the rollout of a direct-buy option, called Freestyle, that allowed customers to purchase items directly from the company with the hopes they'd be won over as regular subscribers. But the initiative stalled and in June, the company announced it'd be laying off about 15% of salaried workers, or about 330 people. The cuts left Stitch Fix with about 1,700 salaried employees, as of June. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData and a retail analyst, said in a statement Thursday that the company looks to have \\\"lost its way\\\" and that the issues it's facing are neither temporary nor immediately solvable. \\\"This is one of the reasons why the company has announced the termination of around 20% of its salaried positions \u2013 an action it hopes will help to stem losses and put the company on a better financial footing,\\\" Saunders said. Stitch Fix employees learned about the job cuts Thursday morning and were told the brand's Salt Lake City distribution center, which has been open for just over a year, will also be shuttering. Approximately 150 employees at that center will also be laid off, according to an employee at the facility. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about internal matters. Staff at the Utah distribution center, which opened three months after Freestyle was launched in December 2021, got the news during their all-hands monthly meeting on Thursday morning, the worker said. Staff were \\\"caught off guard\\\" and surprised to hear about the layoffs because the facility hadn't been open that long, the employee said. \\\"They did good in my opinion. We had [an] all hands right before work and [they] gave us a packet with all the info we needed from final dates to severance. They even had a translator for our Spanish speakers,\\\" the worker told CNBC, adding they felt \\\"overwhelmed\\\" by the news. When Stitch Fix shut down another distribution center in the past, some workers were given the option to relocate to different facilities within the company. It wasn't an option this time around for workers at the Salt Lake City center, the worker said. Salaried employees affected by the cuts will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, which increases with tenure, and health care and mental wellness support will continue through April 2023, Lake said. Lake told staffers she was \\\"truly sorry\\\" for the cuts and thanked them for their \\\"hard work\\\" and \\\"dedication.\\\" As founder, Lake has a unique perspective on the company and its potential, but she will have to contend with a consumer environment that has significantly shifted over the last year and a looming recession that'll see shoppers reduce their spending on discretionary items like new clothes."

Juul said that in order for it to move forward and for operations to continue a \\\"reorganization\\\" of its global workforce will be necessary. The company plans to lay off about 400 people and cut its operating budget by 30% to 40%. Juul has faced financial strains in recent years. In 2015, it introduced its popular e-cigarette, touting it as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes. Since then, the company has been saddled by a variety of legal challenges. Juul settled several large cases brought by state authorities, largely related to its marketing practices, which many suits allege were deceptive and failed to warn about the risks of its products. The deal came ahead of a new report from the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said e-cigarettes \u2014 for the ninth consecutive year \u2014 were the most commonly used tobacco product among middle and high school students in 2022. Overall, nearly 3.1 million students used tobacco products this year, according to the agencies. More than 2.5 million used e-cigarettes. The report said many factors contribute to youth tobacco product use, including flavors, marketing and misperceptions of harm. The FDA ordered Juul to stop selling its vaping products this year and then placed a temporary hold on its order in July. The headwinds hurt the company's bottom line, and analysts predicted it might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a way out."

        "Extracted Article": "Meta is laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees Wednesday. \\\"Today I'm sharing some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history,\\\" Zuckerberg said in the letter. \\\"I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.\\\" Shares of Meta were up about 7.7% Wednesday morning. The layoffs come amid a tough time for Facebook parent company Meta, which provided lukewarm guidance in late October for its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings that spooked investors and caused its shares to sink nearly 20%. Investors have been concerned about Meta's rising costs and expenses, which jumped 19% year over year in the third quarter to $22.1 billion. The company's overall sales declined 4% to $27.71 billion in the quarter while its operating income dropped 46% from the previous year to $5.66 billion. \\\"I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted.\\\" Zuckerberg said. He said Meta is making reductions in every organization but that recruiting will be disproportionately affected since the company plans to hire fewer people in 2023. The company extended its hiring freeze through the first quarter with a few exceptions, Zuckerberg said. \\\"This is a sad moment, and there's no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you've put into this place,\\\" he added. Impacted employees will receive 16 weeks of pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, Zuckerberg said. Meta will cover health insurance for six months. Meta is heavily investing in the metaverse, which generally refers to a yet-to-be developed digital world that can be accessed by virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. This hefty bet has cost Meta $9.4 billion so far in 2022, and the company anticipates that losses \\\"will grow significantly year-over-year.\\\" Zuckerberg said during a call with analysts as part of its third-quarter earnings report that Meta plans to \\\"focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas\\\" during the next year. \\\"That means some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year,\\\" Zuckerberg said. \\\"In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size, or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.\\\" Meta counts more than 87,000 employees as of the end of September. Here's Mark Zuckerberg's letter to employees: \\\"Today I'm sharing some of the most difficult changes we've made in Meta's history. I've decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1. I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I'm especially sorry to those impacted. How did we get here? At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that. In this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We've shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas \u2014 like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We've cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We're restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won't bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I've also made the hard decision to let people go. How will this work? There is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this. Everyone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions. Some of the details in the US include: Severance . We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap. PTO . We'll pay for all remaining PTO time. RSU vesting . Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting. Health insurance . We'll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months. Career services . We'll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads. Immigration support . I know this is especially difficult if you're here on a visa. There's a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need. Outside the US, support will be similar, and we'll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws. We made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we're keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell. While we're making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we're planning to hire fewer people next year. We're also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days. The teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I'm grateful for it. I'm sure you'll go on to do great work at other places. What other changes are we making? I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we're transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We'll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months. We're also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I'm going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently. I'm currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we're focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less. Fundamentally, we're making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we're operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs. How do we move forward? This is a sad moment, and there's no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you've put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I'm grateful for your contributions. To those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we've worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we're making these decisions to make sure our future is strong. I believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing. Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we're leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I'm confident that if we work efficiently, we'll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever. We'll share more on how we'll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I'll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you've done to advance our mission. Mark\\\" Watch : Meta has to go back to their core advertising business and double down."

In August Salesforce issued full-year earnings and revenue guidance that came in below expectations, sending the stock down 3% the next day. Amy Weaver, Salesforce's finance chief, told analysts that demand slowed down among small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in North America and Europe, and in communications, consumer goods, media and retail.

        "Extracted Article": "Hard drive maker Seagate Technology said Wednesday it plans to cut 8% of its global workforce, or about 3,000 employees, citing economic uncertainty and declining demand for its parts. \\\"In addition to adjusting our production output, to drive supply discipline and pricing stability, we are implementing a restructuring plan to sustainably lower costs, including reduction in our global workforce,\\\" Seagate CEO Dave Mosley said on a call with analysts. The restructuring plan was announced after Seagate reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings per share. The company's shares fell more than 7% during trading Wednesday and are down over 55% so far in 2022. Mosley added that Seagate's customers, which include cloud providers, have a buildup of parts inventory because they are spending less on computers. He said he doesn't expect Seagate's customers to finish using up their parts backlogs in the current quarter. The company will maintain paying a dividend, Mosley said. Seagate makes hard drives and other parts often used in PCs and cloud servers. Seagate's layoffs are the latest sign that demand for PCs and cloud servers is deteriorating after two boom years driven by the coronavirus pandemic . On Tuesday, Microsoft , which makes the operating system for most PCs, reported that Windows licensing sales dropped 15% on an annual basis . Microsoft's cloud business also came up short versus expectations. Seagate said that its restructuring plan, which includes the layoffs, would save the company about $110 million per year and would be completed by the end of the company's March quarter. It said it expected to pay pretax charges of about $65 million, mostly for severance and other termination benefits. Seagate reported adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of 48 cents per share on Wednesday, significantly below FactSet consensus expectations of 71 cents per share. Seagate's revenue was $2.04 billion, which also came in under the FactSet consensus of $2.1 billion. Seagate said it expected $1.85 billion in revenue in the current quarter, below FactSet expectations of $2.12 billion."

        "Extracted Article": "Beyond Meat plans to cut 19% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, the company said Friday in a regulatory filing. The cuts are expected to be completed by the end of the year and are an effort to achieve cash flow positive operations within the second half of 2023. In August, the company announced it was trimming its workforce by 4%. Shares of the company fell nearly 10% Friday, dragging the company's market value below $900 million. The stock was already down about 78% so far coming into the trading day, as the plant-based food maker struggles with declining sales. Shares earlier this week notched a 52-week low of $12.76 per share. The announcement came as the company also revealed its chief operating officer, Doug Ramsey, left the company weeks after he was arrested for allegedly biting a man's nose and punching a Subaru in an Arkansas parking garage. As part of the job cuts, the role of chief growth officer has been eliminated and Deanna Jurgens, who held that role, will leave the company. The company also said Chief Financial Officer Philip Hardin stepped down from his post earlier this week. Hardin will leave the company after a roughly two-week transition period to pursue another opportunity, according to the filing. Lubi Kutua, previously Beyond Meat's vice president for financial planning and analysis as well as investor relations, assumed the top financial role on Thursday. Beyond Meat did not immediately return a request for comment on the changes."

        "Extracted Article": "About a year ago, online retailer Packable was preparing to go public through a special purpose acquisition company. With the SPAC market having evaporated and the economy now sputtering, Packable is laying off staff and preparing to liquidate, according to internal documents reviewed by CNBC. Packable is the parent company of Pharmapacks, an online seller of health, personal care and beauty products. Pharmapacks was founded in 2010 as a single brick-and-mortar pharmacy in the Bronx, New York, before it turned to the internet and established a big home on Amazon . Last September, Pharmapacks was the No. 1 Amazon seller in the U.S., though it now ranks fifth among the site's top sellers nationwide, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse . Packable said in a notice to employees Monday that it was laying off 138 people, or roughly 20% of its staff, with the remaining 372 employees expected to be terminated as \\\"individual winddown responsibilities are completed.\\\" The memo was signed by Leanna Bautista, the company's chief people officer. Packable failed to secure new financing that would have enabled it to stay in business, the notice said. \\\"We diligently pursued internal and external financing options but were ultimately unsuccessful,\\\" the company said. \\\"Given the company has no viable financing alternatives, we are now forced to cease operations, liquidate any remaining collateral, and shut down the business, including the facility you report to.\\\" Packable previously secured funding from high-profile investors, including Carlyle Group , Fidelity and Lugard Road Capital. In addition to Amazon, the company sells products on marketplaces run by Walmart , eBay and Target . As of 2020, Amazon was by far Packable's largest channel, accounting for 80% of sales, according to an investor presentation. Amazon's third-party marketplace has become the centerpiece of its dominant e-commerce business, as it now accounts for more than half of online retail sales. Because of Amazon's global reach and massive customer base, many retailers count on the company for the majority, and in some cases the entirety, of their business. Packable's last year has been fraught with turbulence. After announcing in September plans to merge with a SPAC \u2014 Highland Transcend Partners I Corp. \u2014 in a deal that valued the company at $1.55 billion, the market started to turn and investors lost their appetite for SPACs. In March, Packable called off the deal to take the company public, citing \\\"unfavorable market conditions,\\\" just days before Highland Transcend's shareholders were scheduled to meet. Packable CEO Andrew Vagenas quietly resigned in April, and was succeeded by Daniel Myers, according to the company's website . Myers, a former supply chain executive at Mondelez, was named to Packable's board last year. Vagenas still sits on the company's board, according to his LinkedIn . Not a single SPAC was issued in July as what remained of the market dried up completely, according to CNBC calculations of SPAC Research data. A boom in 2020 and 2021 created more than 600 SPACs hunting for targets. For Packable, the disappearance of capital represented a dramatic turn for a business that boomed after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. With consumers stuck at home, online spending surged, and investors poured into the space. Revenue slowed last year from double-digit growth in 2020 as the company struggled to navigate supply-chain constraints, which \\\"resulted in significant inventory out of stock, purchase order delays, and delays in onboarding new customers,\\\" according to an investor presentation. However, the business was still able to grow some through the early part of 2022. In February, Packable said its average daily revenue in January increased to an estimated $1.6 million from $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Representatives from Packable didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. WATCH: What's behind the hype in the Amazon aggregator space"

        "Extracted Article": "Peloton told employees Friday that it is slashing roughly 780 jobs, closing a significant number of its retail stores and hiking prices on some equipment in a bid to cut costs and become profitable. The company did not specify how many of its 86 retail locations it plans to shutter, but said an \\\"aggressive\\\" reduction will begin in 2023. The pace of closures will depend on how quickly Peloton can negotiate getting out of leases. Peloton said it will exit last-mile logistics by closing its remaining warehouses and shift delivery work to third-party providers, resulting in a portion of the job cuts. It is also cutting a number of positions in its in-house support team, which are mainly located in Tempe, Arizona, and Plano, Texas, and instead will rely on third parties. The sweeping changes are part of recently installed Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy's plan to steer the connected fitness equipment maker in a new direction. Peloton's business boomed to unthinkable highs after the onset of the Covid pandemic, sending shares surging alongside other so-called stay-at-home stocks like Zoom . But under then-CEO and Peloton founder John Foley, demand began to slow almost as quickly as it shot up, as people started going out again. McCarthy's biggest tasks now include getting rid of fixed costs and finding more ways to cash in on its loyal base of customers. \\\"The shift of our final mile delivery to 3PLs will reduce our per-product delivery costs by up to 50% and will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in the most cost-efficient way possible,\\\" McCarthy wrote in a memo to employees seen by CNBC. \\\"These expanded partnerships mean we can ensure we have the ability to scale up and down as volume fluctuates,\\\" he added. Peloton, which had just lowered the prices for its products earlier this year , is raising the price of its Bike+ by $500 to $2,495 in the United States. The price of its Tread machine is going up by $800 to $3,495. The price of Peloton's original Bike and its strength-training product known as Guide will remain unchanged. McCarthy acknowledged the about-face on pricing, saying that the equipment price reductions made sense for the company back in April, as Peloton tried to get rid of inventory quickly. Investors sent Peloton shares up 13.6% on Friday. The stock has tumbled more than 60% so far this year, with the company's share price hitting an all-time low of $8.22 in mid-July. Shares had traded as high as $120.62 apiece roughly a year ago. Under McCarthy, who took the reins from Foley in February, the business has focused on ways to grow subscription revenue over hardware sales. Earlier this year, for example, Peloton raised the price of its all-access subscription plan in the United States to $44 per month from $39. In July, Peloton had also announced it would stop all its in-house manufacturing and instead expand its relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer Rexon Industrial. That resulted in about 570 job cuts. The company also suspended operations at its Tonic Fitness facility, which it acquired in 2019, through the remainder of the year. When McCarthy became CEO , Peloton announced it was slashing roughly $800 million in annual costs. That included cutting 2,800 jobs, or about 20% of corporate positions. The company also said it would be walking away from plans to build a sprawling production facility in Ohio. CNBC reported in January , ahead of Foley stepping down, that Peloton planned to temporarily halt production of its equipment, according to internal documents detailing those plans, as a way to control costs with demand dropping. Foley's missteps included making long-term bets on Peloton's supply chain during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic that would later prove to be a drag on its business as sales of its Bikes and Tread machines slowed. Peloton's losses in the three-month period ended March 31 widened to $757.1 million from $8.6 million a year earlier. Revenue dropped to $964.3 million from $1.26 billion. The company ended the quarter with 2.96 million connected fitness subscribers, which are people who own one of the company's products and pay for a membership to its live and on-demand workout classes. \\\"We have to make our revenues stop shrinking and start growing again,\\\" McCarthy, a former Spotify and Netflix executive, said in Friday's memo. \\\"Cash is oxygen. Oxygen is life.\\\" McCarthy said the company is continuing to hire in certain areas, including software and engineering. \\\"I share this so you won't think we're driving with our foot on the gas and the brake at the same time,\\\" he said. McCarthy is also asking all of Peloton's office-based employees to return to the office three days per week starting on Sept. 6. As of Nov. 14, that will be considered mandatory, he said. Peloton is expected to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on August 25. Read the full memo that Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy sent to employees on Friday: Team \u2013 I'm writing to update all of you on Peloton's ongoing transformation. The past few months we've made considerable progress on our journey. We continue to define and lead the global Connected Fitness category, even as we work to make Peloton more efficient, cost effective, innovative, and to best position ourselves for the future. Thank you for your hard work. We have a clear strategy to drive the long-term, sustainable future of this company. Job one is generating free cash flow by right-sizing our inventory commitments and converting many of our fixed costs to variable costs because that cost structure better aligns with the seasonal revenue of the business. Second, we are also focused on innovation across our hardware and software to strengthen our Member experience. And, finally, we're focused on growth and expanding the ways consumers can experience the magic of Peloton. We are making several additional changes to the business to improve our performance. Maintaining Our Premium Brand Positioning For several months we've been running the business to maximize cash flow. In April, we lowered prices on our original Bike, Bike+ and Tread to make the entry point for new Members more accessible and to accelerate the sale of inventory to generate much needed cash flow. At the time, we were still in the early days of our $800 million restructuring plan. We were under considerable cash flow pressure, and we were in the process of (but had not yet completed) securing a $750 million bank loan. Because of our success managing our inventory and supply chain issues, and because of the bank financing, we have the opportunity to adopt a more nuanced pricing strategy targeting \\\"value\\\" and Premium Members alike by increasing prices on our Bike+ and Tread models \u2013 which contain distinctive, superior design elements, while keeping the price of Bike v1 and Guide the same. Specifically, in the U.S., our new price structure will be as follows: Bike+ will increase by $500 to $2,495 Tread will increase by $800 to $3,495 This pricing change achieves three objectives \u2013 we maintain an attractive entry point for new Members; we continue to sell down excess Bike v1 inventory, creating a financial tailwind on investments already made; and we maintain our position as the undisputed premium brand in the Connected Fitness category. Optimizing our Operations and Workforce We continue to make strategic changes to our operations and workforce. Following last month's exit from owned-manufacturing in Taiwan, we are now restructuring our final mile delivery capabilities by expanding our work with our third party logistics (3PLs) providers. As a result, we are eliminating our North American Field Ops warehouses, resulting in a significant reduction in our delivery workforce teams. Unfortunately, this means a number of team members will be departing the company. We know changes of this nature are never easy. The shift of our final mile delivery to 3PLs will reduce our per-product delivery costs by up to 50% and will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in the most cost-efficient way possible. I also want to highlight that we have been actively working with our 3PLs to dramatically improve the Member experience, and we are seeing positive momentum in those CSAT scores. This has been a challenge. We won't fix it overnight, but we have no choice but to make it work, so we're leaning into it and proactively managing our 3PL relationships. We are confident in the plan we've put in place and we're encouraged by the progress we're making. After re-examining the resources required to provide our Members best-in-class support, we have also decided to reduce fixed costs by eliminating a significant number of roles on the in-house North America Member Support Team. In-bound Member support volume has been lower than forecasted, and like other parts of the business, we are going to expand our work with our third party partners. These expanded partnerships mean we can ensure we have the ability to scale up and down as volume fluctuates while still continuing to provide the level of service our Members have come to expect. These are hard choices because we are impacting people's lives. These changes are essential if Peloton is ever going to become cash flow positive. Cash is oxygen. Oxygen is life. We simply must become self-sustaining on a cash flow basis. I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those delivery team and Member Support colleagues who have been impacted by this decision. Investing in Talent to Innovate and Grow In the past you have heard me say we cannot cost cut our way to success. We have to make our revenues stop shrinking and start growing again. We do that with investments in marketing and R & D to drive innovative products. We must also develop new features and functionality for existing CF platforms that delight Members and drive word-of-mouth which drives organic growth. And, we double-down on our existing strengths, particularly our world-class, Instructor-led content that motivates and inspires Members daily. While we're reducing our workforce in certain areas of the business, we continue to fill roles on key teams to drive the business forward. This includes further commitment to recruiting top talent in key areas of need such as our software engineering team. I share this so you won't think we're driving with our foot on the gas and the brake at the same time. Success is about making the right investments to drive growth while managing to a cost structure the business can afford. I've also long-believed hands-on, shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration is essential for fast, efficient teamwork and innovation. To that end, we'll be asking all office-based employees to return to their office three days per week starting on Tuesday, September 6th. We know some of you will need more time to sort out related details, and we are asking that you do so, working with your manager, with a deadline of Monday, November 14th for all of us to be back in the office (if your PeloTeam designation is office-based) every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. You also are welcome to come in more often, if you'd like, and take full advantage of the office amenities and gym. As of November 14th, return to office for office-based workers (not you if you were hired to be remote) will be mandatory. There are many successful businesses, like Airbnb and Spotify, who have chosen to operate remotely. There are also many successful companies who have opted to collaborate in the office in person, like Nike and Google. The culture you choose to work in should be compatible with your personal preference. For those of you who don't want to return to the office, we respect your choice. We hope you choose to stay, but we understand not everyone will. Balancing e-Commerce and Retail Lastly, we need to rebalance our e-Commerce and retail mix to drive efficiencies, which means we will reduce our retail presence across North America. This decision will result in a significant and aggressive reduction of Peloton's retail footprint. Data tells us that in the post-COVID economy, consumers want a mix of virtual and in-person engagement with the brands they love, meaning a hybrid model of e-commerce as well as limited physical retail touchpoints. We have to meet our prospective Members where they are. We will provide future updates on which retail operations will be impacted by this decision in the coming months. We do not anticipate closing retail locations in calendar 2022, but the timing is uncertain as we begin negotiations to exit our store leases. Forward Focused In closing, I want to reiterate that I know some of this news is difficult to hear as it has a real impact on people's lives who believe in the mission and our ability to manage the business for success. Today's news reminds us it was never more important that we be successful in managing our turnaround. That's the reason we're making the hard choices to shift our cost structure from fixed to variable and to right size our spending in retail stores. As we face economic uncertainty in the global macroeconomic outlook, we will continue to analyze our workforce and expenditures. Change is constant, and we need to embrace it and make it one of our super powers. Overall, I continue to be optimistic about the future of Peloton. That doesn't mean there won't be challenges ahead. There will be, and there will be unforeseen setbacks. That's the nature of turnarounds. But I'm confident we can overcome the challenges because we've come so far in just the last four months, which feeds my optimism about our ability to engineer our long-term success. No one's gonna give it to us, least of all our competitors. We're going to have to step up and make it happen. The future of connected fitness is Peloton's to own. Me to you. You to me. You to each other. And all of us to our Members. -Barry"

        "Extracted Article": "Shares of Sweetgreen fell after the salad chain lowered its 2022 forecast. The restaurant company also said it laid off 5% of its support center workforce and will downsize to a smaller office building to lower its operating expenses. Shares in the company fell more than 20% in after-hours trading following the earnings report Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the stock was down about 4% amid a broader market rally. As of Tuesday's close, Sweetgreen's stock has fallen about 47% this year to $16.85. It reached a high of $56.20 shortly after its IPO in November. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Loss per share: 36 cents, in line with estimates Revenue: $124.9 million vs. $130.2 million expected Sweetgreen sales softened around Memorial Day, leading the company to revise its forecast lower, CFO Mitch Reback said in a statement. On the company's conference call, executives attributed the slowdown to a number of factors, including \\\"unprecedented levels of summer travel,\\\" a slow return to the office and another wave of new Covid-19 cases. In the quarter, ended June 26, Sweetgreen's net sales rose 45% to $124.9 million. Its same-store sales climbed 16%, boosted by 6% menu price hikes. For the year, Sweetgreen now expects annual revenue of $480 million to $500 million, down from its prior forecast of $515 million to $535 million. The chain also revised its outlook for same-store sales, predicting growth of 13% to 19%, down from the previous projection of 20% to 26%. \\\"We think that it's a conservative estimate, but looking back, we've just been wrong on so many of these calls,\\\" Reback said on the call. Moreover, Sweetgreen also changed its outlook for adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to a range of $45 million to $35 million, wider than its previous range of $40 million to $33 million. But the chain explained the steps it's taking to achieve profitability, including layoffs and reducing its real estate footprint by moving to a smaller office. Severance packages and related benefits are expected to cost the company between $500,000 to $800,000, while the office move will cost $8.4 million to $9.9 million. The charges are expected to impact its third-quarter results. Sweetgreen reported a second-quarter net loss of $40 million, or 36 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $26 million, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier. The company blamed an increase in stock-based compensation for its increasing losses. Read the full earnings report here. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Sweetgreen's previous forecast for its same-store sales growth."

        "Extracted Article": "Tonal, the connected fitness equipment maker that counts tennis superstar Serena Williams and Amazon 's Alexa fund as backers, is cutting 35% of its workforce, affecting all levels of its business, CNBC has learned. The company employs about 750 people today, compared with a little more than 110 before the Covid-19 pandemic , Chief Executive Officer Aly Orady said in an interview. Orady also emphasized the need to be profitable, particularly as the company eyes an initial public offering. Tonal hasn't been profitable in the past, he said. But the job cuts will put the company on track to make money in a matter of months, he added. Tonal, which sells wall-mounted workout devices for $3,495, experienced rampant growth in 2020 and 2021 as consumers were stuck at home and seeking ways to break a sweat. Tonal's brand awareness also exploded as it tapped star athletes such as LeBron James and Williams to appear in its commercials. It has raked in $450 million in funding, to date, and at one point in 2021 was valued at as much as $1.6 billion . But for now, Tonal is tapping the brakes. It joins a list of businesses \u2013 including competitor Peloton \u2013 that are reducing head count in order to trim expenses and readjust to new levels of consumer demand for their products. Businesses are simultaneously grappling with red-hot inflation on everything from raw materials to fuel to workers' salaries, and many are preparing for an economic slowdown, even if a recession isn't certain. \\\"As we head into a recession \u2014 and many of us believe we're headed into a recession \u2014 it's really important that we become a business that's here for the long term,\\\" Orady said in an interview. \\\"What we're doing is effectively going from a hypergrowth business ... to more of a sustained-growth business.\\\" Tonal didn't disclose exactly how much money it plans to save through the layoffs. It also didn't say if its valuation has been adjusted in the private markets. \\\"The public markets are no longer rewarding hypergrowth when it comes at the expense of profitability. And as such, private market investors are no longer investing as many dollars or as aggressively to support businesses through hypergrowth,\\\" Orady said. \\\"Those dollars just aren't out there the way they were a year ago.\\\" Investors are increasingly shying away from money-losing entities, he said. It shows in the stocks of some of the publicly traded companies that fit this bill. Shares of Peloton, for example, hit a fresh all-time low Wednesday of $8.66, having dropped more than 70% year to date. Peloton's losses in the three-month period ended March 31 widened to $757.1 from a loss of $8.6 million a year earlier. Allbirds , a shoemaker that has booked losses since going public last year, has watched its stock price tumble more than 65% this year. Shares of eyeglasses retailer Warby Parker , which went public via a direct listing in 2021 and is also losing money, are down more than 70% year to date. Orady said Tonal is focused on cutting customer acquisition costs, and it will do that in part by scaling back on advertising. He said he attributes any slowdown in sales in the past 90 days to Tonal pulling back on marketing, but overall demand has remained steady. The company also recently hiked the price of its equipment by $500, to $3,495 from $2,995. All of Tonal's employees who are impacted by the job cuts will receive a minimum of eight weeks of continued pay, the company said, as well as health-care benefits through the end of September. Tonal also said in its memo to workers that it is offering extended equity vesting for all employees to become shareholders, including accelerated stock option vesting and an extension on the window of time that option holders have to exercise their stock options for up to four years."

        "Extracted Article": "Microsoft said Tuesday it cut a small number of workers, days after the software maker began its 2023 fiscal year, a time when the company normally announces structural changes. Technology companies big and small have slowed hiring plans or announced reductions in the workforce in recent months to withstand a possible economic recession , which central bankers have been trying to ward off by raising interest rates. That shift has made investors less interested in growth-oriented stocks such as Microsoft, whose shares have declined about 22% since the start of the year, while the larger S & P 500 index is down 19% over the same period. The cuts reach a variety of groups and affect less than 1% of the company, which employed 181,000 people as of June 2021, the company said. \\\"Today we notified a small number of employees that their roles have been eliminated,\\\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. \\\"This was a result of a strategic realignment, and, like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis. We continue to invest in certain areas and grow headcount in the year ahead.\\\" Bloomberg reported on the move earlier. The Microsoft executive in charge of Office productivity software, Rajesh Jha, in May told his team to obtain permission before opening new roles. In June, Microsoft slashed its income and revenue guidance , citing unfavorable foreign-exchange rates. On Monday technology industry research group Gartner estimated that PC shipments, a factor affecting Microsoft's Windows operating system business, fell nearly 13% in the third quarter, the most sluggish performance in nine years, in part because of geopolitical issues. Microsoft last announced a round of layoffs in 2017, after the start of its new fiscal year. The company trimmed thousands of employees as it adjusted its approach to selling . Facebook parent Meta Platforms decreased its target for adding software engineers this year from 10,000 to around 6,000 to 7,000, Reuters reported last week. Amazon's retail division decreased its 2022 hiring goal as well, Insider reported in May. WATCH: Microsoft says it's open to working with unions"

        "Extracted Article": "UiPath will reduce roughly 5% of its total workforce as part of a restructuring plan, according to a new SEC filing . The company, a provider of software for automating office tasks, said that it had 4,200 employees as of April 30, 2022. Most of the layoffs are expected to occur by the end of July. UiPath's board approved the decision to reduce headcount, citing the need to increase profits, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said. The software provider estimates that it will spend $15 million as part of the plan, mainly to pay for employee severance and compensation benefits. A spokesperson told CNBC that UiPath's layoffs are not related to market conditions. \\\"In the context of ongoing business prioritization, UiPath is undertaking a restructuring action that will primarily focus on the effectiveness of our go-to-market organization,\\\" the spokesperson said, noting that the company believes the cuts will help it simplify its go-to-market approach and lead to higher sales productivity and better market segmentation. Shares of UiPath were off about 1% in midday trading on Monday and are down about 49% year to date. But shares are up about 23% for the month after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on June 1 that exceeded prior guidance and raised the outlook for the following quarter. \\\"This is about continuing to drive sustained, profitable growth. We want to thank our departing team members \u2014 we appreciate their incredible talent and contributions in support of UiPath and our mission,\\\" the spokesperson added. The software provider has more than 45 offices across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. \\\"The announcement signals PATH's increasing focus on profitability amid growing investor scrutiny on tech stocks with limited profitability & FCF,\\\" Cowen analysts said in a note to investors on Monday. \\\"It had signaled its commitment to its longer-term 20% adj EBIT target and this news reflects the first major changes put into place post its recent senior management appointments (new Co-CEO and chief business officer).\\\""

The cuts, which represent about 3% of total employees, come about a month after the streaming company eliminated about 150 positions in the wake of its first subscriber loss in a decade. \\\"Today we sadly let go of around 300 employees,\\\" Netflix said in a statement Thursday. \\\"While we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth.

Spencer Neumann, the company's chief financial officer, said during the company's earnings call in April that Netflix is trying to be \\\"prudent\\\" about pulling back to reflect the realities of its business. However, it still plans to invest heavily, including around $17 billion on content. Co-CEO Reed Hastings also said during the call that the company is exploring lower-priced, ad-supported tiers in a bid to bring in new subscribers after years of resisting advertisements on the platform. Netflix is working to crack down on rampant password sharing as well. In addition to its 222 million paying households, more than 100 million households use its service through account sharing , the company said. Netflix shares were roughly even in afternoon trading Thursday, but are off more around 70% year to date."

        "Extracted Article": "Coinbase is laying off almost a fifth of its workforce amid a collapse in its stock and crypto prices . The cryptocurrency exchange will cut 18% of full-time jobs , according to an email sent to employees Tuesday morning. Coinbase has roughly 5,000 full-time workers, translating to a head count reduction of around 1,100 people. Shares of Coinbase closed down .83%. CEO Brian Armstrong pointed to a possible recession, and a need to manage Coinbase's burn rate and increase efficiency. He also said the company grew \\\"too quickly\\\" during a bull market. \\\"We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,\\\" Armstrong said in the email, adding that past crypto winters have resulted in a significant decline in trading activity. \\\"While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.\\\" Coinbase had initially said it was pausing hiring. Two weeks later, the crypto giant announced that it was extending the freeze for the \\\"foreseeable future.\\\" Earlier this year, Coinbase said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. \\\"Our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market,\\\" Armstrong said. \\\"While we tried our best to get this just right, in this case it is now clear to me that we over-hired.\\\" The news comes during a deep rout for Coinbase shares. The stock went public via a direct listing last April during a boom in crypto markets and investors clamoring for high-growth tech stocks. Coinbase's shares are down 79% this year and 85% from the all-time high. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped to near $22,000 and has lost 53% of its value this year. San Francisco-based Coinbase reported a slump in users in its last quarter and a 27% decline in revenue from a year ago. The company gets the majority of its top line from transaction fees, which are closely tied to trading activity. President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi called it a \\\"very difficult decision for Coinbase\\\" but given the economic backdrop, she said it \\\"felt like the most prudent thing to do right now.\\\" Affected employees received a notification from human resources. If so, the memo was sent to a personal email as Coinbase cut off access to the company systems. Armstrong called it the \\\"only practical choice\\\" given the number of employees with access to customer information, and a way to \\\"ensure not even a single person made a rash decision that harmed the business or themselves.\\\" Coinbase employees will have access to a talent hub to find new jobs in the industry, including Coinbase Ventures' portfolio companies. Choi said Coinbase would still be \\\"doubling down\\\" on areas like security and compliance and may be \\\"reorienting\\\" employees to near-term revenue drivers. \\\"If there are any cuts to new product areas, it's going to be more around experimental venture areas that we're still very bullish on, but that we don't want to invest in in this part of the cycle,\\\" Choi told CNBC in an interview at the company's headquarters. \\\"We will continue to invest in incredible innovative areas of crypto that we think are emerging over the longer term, but we're probably going to do those in a more measured way in this type of an environment.\\\" Coinbase joins dozens of other tech and crypto companies slamming the brakes on hiring. Crypto lender BlockFi said Monday it was cutting 20% of its employees . Open-source tracker Layoffs.fyi estimates that more than 5,500 start-up and tech jobs have been cut in June alone. Coinbase's intention is \\\"that this is a one-time event,\\\" Choi said adding that the company has $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company has lived through multiple bear markets in crypto before, also known as \\\"crypto winters.\\\" \\\"We will power through any macro environment, any crypto winter, or anything that's coming,\\\" she said. \\\"The reality though, is that we have to adjust when we feel that there's a very dynamic economic environment in play.\\\" Tech companies have been fighting low morale and attrition as their stocks get slammed. Last week, a petition posted to a decentralized publishing platform called for the removal and a \\\"vote of no confidence\\\" regarding several Coinbase executives, including Choi. Armstrong called attention to the since-deleted petition, and in a Tweet urged employees to quit if they don't believe in the company. \\\"We will always encourage our employees to share feedback internally on how we operate as a company \u2014 and we have a number of mechanisms in place for them to do so. It's very much unclear if this document came from within the company,\\\" Choi said. \\\"However, if it did, we're disappointed that those behind it felt the need to breach the trust of the company and their co-workers by sharing this information in a way clearly designed to drive controversy rather than a meaningful dialogue.\\\" Coinbase has no plans to offer additional company equity grants, or cash compensation amid the price drop, Choi said. The company offers annual grants, partially so employees could \\\"mitigate the swings\\\" and volatility in crypto. For employees and investors, the COO likened it to Amazon or Tesla : a long-term investment with volatility in the meantime. \\\"We think that anyone who makes an investment, whether they're an employee or investor, will have a handsome return over the longer term,\\\" Choi said. \\\"Coinbase is a long-term play \u2014 we have very deep conviction in the long-term value of the stock.\\\""

        "Extracted Article": "Stitch Fix said Thursday that it is laying off 15% of salaried positions within its workforce, mostly in corporate roles and styling leadership positions, in a bid to trim expenses amid red hot inflation and waning consumer demand for certain items. CNBC was first to report on the layoffs, which the company confirmed Thursday afternoon as it reported its financial results for the three-month period ended April 30. Stitch Fix said it expects to save between $40 million to $60 million in fiscal year 2023 with the job cuts and other changes. It also anticipates incurring restructuring and other one-time charges of roughly $15 million to $20 million, which will be recognized in its upcoming fourth quarter. The company also offered up a disappointing forecast for its fiscal fourth quarter, calling for revenue to be between $485 million and $495 million, which would represent as much as a 15% drop from prior-year levels. Stitch Fix shares tumbled nearly 11% Thursday, closing the day at $7.78. They fell again Friday. The stock traded as high as $68.15 a year ago. The job cuts come as the online styling service has been grappling with higher expenses on everything from its supply chain to marketing to labor, and it has also been struggling to onboard new users. \\\"We've taken a renewed look at our business and what is required to build our future,\\\" Stitch Fix CEO Elizabeth Spaulding said in a memo to employees. \\\"While this was an incredibly difficult decision, it was one needed to make to position ourselves for profitable growth.\\\" The roughly 330 people were notified of the cuts on Thursday morning, the memo said. That number represents about 4% of the company's overall workforce. The cutbacks at Stitch Fix fit into a broader trend shaping up within the U.S. labor market , as pandemic darlings such as Peloton , Netflix and Wayfair become more conservative with their hiring, but airlines, restaurants and hospitality chains still struggle to fill roles. The layoffs come three months after Stitch Fix cut its revenue guidance for the year and withdrew its earnings forecast. Spaulding said the company's active client count was not where she wanted it to be. As of April 30, Stitch Fix counted 3.9 million customers, a 5% drop from the prior year. Stitch Fix's business is entirely online and that was seen as a bright spot during earlier stages of the Covid pandemic, as spending shifted online. More recently, its rollout of a direct-buy option known as Freestyle didn't go as well as the company had hoped for. And more and more shoppers are shifting back to spending their money in stores as pandemic restrictions lift. Stitch Fix reported a net loss for its fiscal third quarter of $78 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with a loss of $18.8 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 8% to $492.9 million from $535.6 million a year earlier. \\\"We know we still have work to do,\\\" Spaulding said in a press release. Stitch Fix's market cap has fallen below $1 billion, as the stock has declined about 58% this year."

Shares of Tesla dipped 9% on Friday by midmorning after Reuters reported on an earlier email Musk had sent to executives about his plans to cut the company's workforce and expressing a \\\"super bad feeling\\\" about the economy. In its year-end financial filing , Tesla said it employed 99,290 people around the world as of the end of 2021. President Joe Biden was asked about Musk's negative economic outlook on Friday after news of Tesla's head count reduction was out. Biden said that while Musk is talking about economic fears and reductions, Ford is increasing its investment in building new electric vehicles, with 6,000 new, union employees in the Midwest. The president also lauded the former Chrysler Corp., Stellantis , for making similar investments in electric vehicle production in the U.S. and Intel for adding 20,000 new jobs in computer chip manufacturing. \\\"So, you know, lots of luck on his trip to the moon,\\\" Biden quipped. Here's the new email Musk sent to all Tesla employees as transcribed by CNBC: To: Everybody Subject: Headcount Reduction Date: Friday, June 3, 2022 Tesla will be reducing salaried headcount by 10% as we have become overstaffed in many areas. Note this does not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar. Hourly headcount will increase. Elon --- \u2014 CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report."

        "Extracted Article": "Retail brokerage firm Robinhood is cutting back staffing levels, citing \\\"duplicate roles and job functions\\\" after rapid expansion last year. CEO Vlad Tenev made the announcement in a blog post on Tuesday afternoon. Shares fell more than 5% in extended trading. The move will affect about 9% of full-time employees. Robinhood reported 3,800 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. The company declined to give more detail on the exact number of employees being let go. \\\"We determined that making these reductions to Robinhood's staff is the right decision to improve efficiency, increase our velocity, and ensure that we are responsive to the changing needs of our customers,\\\" Tenev wrote. \\\"While the decision to undertake this action wasn't easy, it is a deliberate step to ensure we are able to continue delivering on our strategic goals and furthering our mission to democratize finance,\\\" he added. Robinhood is scheduled to release its first-quarter results after the bell on Thursday. The blog post didn't mention those financial results other than saying that the company has more than $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. The company previously reported having $6.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of December. Going forward, the company will review employee growth plans and \\\"continue to prioritize internal opportunities for automation and operational efficiency,\\\" Tenev wrote. Robinhood rose to prominence in early 2021 as a key player in the GameStop saga , where retail investors bid up so-called meme stocks. The brokerage saw a surge of new customers and cash, and entered the public markets through an IPO in July . However, the stock gained little traction and has traded below its IPO price of $38 per share for much of its existence. Shares closed at $10 on Tuesday. The company shed monthly active users during the fourth quarter , and its first-quarter results will face tough comparisons to the GameStop mania of the first quarter of 2021."
