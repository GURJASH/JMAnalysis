        "Extracted Article": "Commercetools a \u201cheadless commerce platform that provides APIs to companies building online storefronts saw a major boost in its business just a few years ago, raising money at a whopping $1.9 billion valuation as the world went shopping online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and businesses rushed to improve their e-commerce operations. Today, the playbook looks a little different for e-commerce, and for Commercetools.&nbsp; TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Commercetools has laid off dozens of employees over the last few weeks, including around 10% of staff earlier Wednesday, after failing to meet its sales growth targets. It\u2019s also making a number of executive changes, including parting ways with its chief revenue officer and CFO, and reassigning the roles previously held by its chief information security and compliance officer.&nbsp; \u201cWhile we\u2019ve made meaningful progress and our business continues to grow, over the last several quarters we haven\u2019t fully achieved our aggressive revenue growth targets,\u201d CEO Andrew Burton said in a memo to the company, which TechCrunch has viewed. \u201cThat reality has required me, our executive team, and our Board to take a hard, in-depth look at where we fell short, where we showed strength, and what needs to change to build a stronger future.\u201d Significant restructuring will be carried out in marketing, sales, and internal operations such as HR and finance, according to the memo. Select staff in customer and product development will also be cut \u201cafter reviewing performance and impact. The full memo, shared by a source and confirmed as authentic by the company, is published below.&nbsp; Burton, speaking to TechCrunch after we contacted the company about the memo, said that around 10% of the companys employees were affected today, but declined to give an exact number. A source, who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, said Wednesdays layoffs total more than 70 people and, including selective reductions he claimed happened over a period of several weeks, make up to 20% of staff. The company disputes that there have been any layoffs beyond those announced Wednesday. Burton also added the company has 25-30 open roles its looking to fill. It\u2019s a difficult bump in the road for a company that appears to have had a strong run in the market. Originally founded in 2006 in Munich, Germany, Commercetools raised just $30 million in outside funding before it was acquired by retail giant REWE in 2015. By 2019, it was seeing its revenues growing at 110% annually. REWE spun it out as a startup again, backed with $145 million in funding from Insight Partners at a $300 million valuation. After COVID-19 hit, Commercetools\u2019 business boomed as shopping of all kinds went digital. Less than three years after that Insight round, it was able to raise $140 million at a $1.9 billion valuation led by Accel. Through all of this, Commercetools\u2019 founder Dirk Hoerig led the company as CEO. He stepped away from the top position in July 2024, to be replaced by Burton. (Hoerig has retained a seat on the board and is the company\u2019s chief innovation officer.)&nbsp; At the time, the company was making \u201cfar beyond\u201d $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and Burton\u2019s arrival was seen as a precursor to the company going public, reportedly in 2025 or 2026. Burton declined to comment today on an IPO or other future plans. The memo cites, at a high level, that Commercetools was missing its growth targets. There have been other more specific shifts in the market. While Commercetools was a very early mover in the space of \u201cheadless commerce\u201d \u2014 a term first coined by Hoerig \u2014 a number of competitors have emerged in more recent years. Chief among them is Shopify, which originally pitched itself to smaller merchants and has gradually grown into working with the same larger retailers that Commercetools targets.&nbsp; At the same time, e-commerce has continued to grow, but not at the breakneck pace seen between 2020 and 2022. The most recent U.S. Census Bureau figures noted that U.S. retail e-commerce grew just 2.7% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2024, totaling $308.9 billion and accounting for 16.4% of all retail sales. Earlier today, eBay noted that its Q4 sales grew just 1%. Burton also cited question marks over how tariffs would play out as another factor impacting e-commerce companies, and the knock-on effect that has on suppliers like Commercetools. We had really ambitious goals that we had not reset to reflect the macro-economic uncertainty, Burton told TechCrunch Wednesday. Finally, while brand-owned storefronts \u2014 a mainstay business for companies like Commercetools \u2014 continue to make up a giant part of the e-commerce market, theyre also competing against a new wave of marketplaces. Temu, Instagram, and TikTok all represent a new kind of social commerce that once again could change the game. Other headless companies be they focused on e-commerce or content management or something else that have seen growth with the growth of the internet now have to respond to changing tides, be it a new method of content consumption or buying goods, or AI. The ball\u2019s in the court for companies like Commercetools to anticipate and build for wherever and however people may want to shop in the future. Memo below: Subject:&nbsp;Important Update Hi team, Over the past few years, we set ambitious goals, anticipating strong market growth. While we\u2019ve made meaningful progress and our business continues to grow, over the last several quarters we haven\u2019t fully achieved our aggressive revenue growth targets. That reality has required me, our executive team, and our Board to take a hard, in-depth look at where we fell short, where we showed strength, and what needs to change to build a stronger future. As part of this, we made the difficult decision to restructure a few teams, implement targeted reductions in specific areas, and eliminate some roles. This decision is not a reflection on individual commercetoolers, their talent, dedication, or impact, but instead a necessary step to sharpen our focus and re-position&nbsp;commercetools&nbsp;to be in a stronger position to navigate and succeed in this turbulent market. Many of you have built strong relationships with the colleagues who are leaving today. They have shaped&nbsp;commercetools&nbsp;in ways big and small, and we are truly grateful. We are providing all impacted employees with severance and continued benefits above the market standard. Additionally, we are continuing their access to OpenUp, our online platform offering diverse mental health support resources, to support them in this transition. I know this is hard news to process. Change brings uncertainty, and we are committed to providing as much clarity, support, and direction as possible. To help answer common questions, we\u2019ve put together an Employee FAQ that outlines key details about the restructuring, resources available, and what\u2019s next. To give everyone space to reflect, we are giving all employees this Friday, February 28th as a day off. Your executive leader will meet with your department later today or tomorrow to discuss what this means for you and your team. What\u2019s Changing C-level Updates: Bruno Teuber (CRO)&nbsp;\u2013 Transitioning out of the executive team, staying as an advisor until the end of H1. A new CRO search has started; in the interim, sales will report to me. Dan Murphy (CFO)&nbsp;\u2013 Transitioning out of the executive team, advising until the end of H1. CFO role&nbsp;will not be backfilled; Finance, Digital Solutions, and Legal will report to Matt Tuel (COO). Denis Werner (Chief Information Security &amp; Compliance Officer)&nbsp;\u2013 Moving to a compliance-focused role under Dirk H\u00f6rig. IT Ops moving to Digital Solutions under Matt Tuel, Information Security moving to Product under Hajo Eichler, and Office Management moving to People under Roxana Dobrescu. Teams with Significant Restructuring: Marketing (including BDRs)&nbsp;\u2013 Realignment to focus on enterprise GTM model and sales PODs. Sales &amp; Operations&nbsp;\u2013 Restructuring to improve sales support and focus on top markets/customers. Enablement Functions (Finance, People, etc.)&nbsp;\u2013 Consolidating teams for better operational efficiency. Other Impacted Areas&nbsp;\u2013 Select cuts in&nbsp;Customer and Product Development&nbsp;after reviewing performance and impact. Change is never easy, but it\u2019s at the core of what we do \u2014 helping businesses adapt to new realities. Now, we\u2019re doing the same. In our&nbsp;Company All Hands tomorrow, we will walk through these changes in more detail \u2014 the why, what, and how we move forward together \u2014 staying true to our belief in adapting boldly to build what\u2019s next. Andrew&nbsp; Updated to note that Commercetools disputes the total number of layoffs claimed by a source."

        "Extracted Article": "Cloud communication service Bird has cut 120 jobs roughly one-third of its total workforce. The Amsterdam-based firm formerly known as MessageBird plans to realign its global operations amid the ongoing AI boom, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Bird has since confirmed the news. The Dutch startup contacted impacted employees on Friday. The move comes just a year after Bird cut 90 employees following its rebrand. The company also slashed prices at the time in an effort to take on the likes of Twilio, Klaviyo, and Attentive. The startup offers a CRM (customer relationship management) platform for marketing, sales, and payments via email, SMS, and WhatsApp. Bird founder and CEO Robert Vis confirmed the number of employees impacted, adding that most of the roles were in Europe. While Bird was founded in Amsterdam and built strong European roots, our customer footprint has grown significantly in the Americas and Asia. This realignment will position our teams closer to our customers, enabling us to better serve them in their local time zones and cultural contexts, Vis said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The startup counts Meta, PayPal, Square, and Uber as its key customers. It offers a unified solution to let businesses communicate with their customers via different channels, including email, SMS, voice, and WhatsApp. Vis asserted the layoffs were not a cost-reduction exercise as the startups financials remain strong. Instead, AI adoption has contributed to the reduction of roles. The list of similarly impacted companies includes Sprinklr, Workday, and Okta. The changes will help us return to the agile, focused model that drove our early success \u2014 starting with SMS and expanding to become one of the worlds largest providers of business communications solutions, Vis said. The executive stated that the affected employees would receive comprehensive transition support without sharing specifics on the severance. In 2021, Bird raised $800 million in a Series C extension featuring Tiger Global, Eurazeo, and Owl Rock. That followed a $240 million round that valued the startup at $3 billion. The startup acquired email marketing platform SparkPost in 2021 for $600 million."

The new layoffs come less than a year after the company cut about 3% of its workforce in May and after it earlier reduced its headcount by 4% in 2023. The two earlier layoffs impacted roughly 200 employees altogether. The New York-headquartered company, which counts Microsoft, P&amp;G, and Samsung among over 1,800 global customers, started notifying affected employees about the cuts this week, TechCrunch learned and confirmed with the company. We will refocus and rebalance our investments, talent, and resources in order to better serve our customers and partners and help them realize the full value of our AI-powered platform, a Sprinklr spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the move does not impact C-level positions. The company will continue to hire in prioritized areas to focus on its strategic priorities, the spokesperson said. Last week, Sprinklr appointed former PwC partner Jan Hauser and former Lenovo CEO and C3.ai founding member Stephen Ward as new board directors amid its shifting focus toward developing AI-led experiences. In a related announcement, Sprinklr said that current board member and audit committee chair, Ed Gillis, who has served since November 2015, is stepping down from his position at the end of March. Per its most recent annual report released in March of last year, Sprinklr had 3,869 employees, including 2,276 in India and 787 in the U.S. We will support departing teammates with the greatest care and respect, acknowledging their contributions to Sprinklr, and assisting them in their transition, the spokesperson said.

        "Extracted Article": "Autonomous vehicle company Cruise is laying off nearly 50% of its workforce \u2014 cuts that extend to the CEO and several other top executives \u2014 as it prepares to shut down operations. What remains of Cruise will move under parent company General Motors as the automaker directs its resources toward improving its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise \u2014 and eventually rolls out personal autonomous vehicles. The layoffs were announced by Craig Glidden, Cruise\u2019s president and chief administrative officer, according to a companywide email that TechCrunch has viewed and verified with sources.&nbsp;Individuals who were affected received a separate email from Cruise Chief Human Resources Officer Nilka Thomas. CEO Marc Whitten will depart from Cruise this week, along with Thomas, Chief Safety Officer Steve Kenner, and Global Head of Public Policy Rob Grant. Mo Elshenawy, Cruises chief technologist, will stay on through the end of April to help with the transition. As a result of the change in strategy we announced in December, today we will part with nearly 50% of our Cruise employee base, through a reduction in force, the email from Glidden reads. Anyone who has been through a reduction knows that days like this are extremely difficult, and today is no different. With our move away from the ride-hail business and toward providing autonomous vehicles to customers alongside GM, our staffing and resource needs have dramatically changed. Todays actions align our teams to our new needs, and focus our efforts on continuing to build world-class AV technology. As of January 2024, Cruise employed about 2,100 people, according to sources who based the estimates on the number of members on a Slack channel for company announcements. That means more than 1,000 employees might have been impacted by the layoffs. Cruise shared the difficult decision to part ways with approximately 50% of its workforce, the company wrote in an emailed statement. We are grateful for their passion and contributions to help us reach this stage, and our focus is on supporting them into their next chapter with severance packages and career support. While not an easy decision, we are focused on combining efforts with General Motors to accelerate autonomy at scale on personal autonomous vehicles. GM sent out a press release (after the layoffs were announced internally) that it has completed its acquisition of GM Cruise Holdings LLC following the approval of GM\u2019s merger offer by the Cruise board of directors. Cruise is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM. All employees who were laid off will remain on the companys payroll through April 5 and receive benefits through the end of April. Affected workers will receive eight weeks of severance pay and benefits. Long-term employees will be offered another two weeks of pay and benefits for every full year of employment over three years. All employees will also receive three months of company-paid COBRA coverage, as well as a Linkedin Premium subscription for a year to support their job search. The layoffs come nearly two months after GM said it would no longer fund the development of a commercial robotaxi business and would instead focus on building personal autonomous vehicle technology.&nbsp; The automaker expects to save up to $1 billion annually by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program, according to details shared during the companys fourth-quarter earnings call. At the time, CFO Paul Jacobson said the projected cost savings were based on the assumption that \u201cCruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year.\u201d In mid-January, Cruise management started to extend retention offers to employees, almost all of whom were engineers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email to Cruise employees, CEO Marc Whitten indicated that next steps would come after the Cruise board met. That meeting happened on Monday, according to one source.&nbsp; While Cruise employees were initially blindsided by GM\u2019s decision to pull the plug on the robotaxi development program, they have been expecting such an announcement for weeks. Sources who spoke to TechCrunch said they have been hardly working and in a state of limbo since GM\u2019s announcement as they awaited next steps. On Monday afternoon, Glidden sent a Slack message to employees saying that he expects to share \u201csome news regarding the transition plans tomorrow\u201d and advised staffers to \u201cplan on working from home.\u201d&nbsp; \u201cThank you for your patience during this time we know the uncertainty has been difficult but you have navigated the past weeks with grace and professionalism,\u201d Glidden wrote.&nbsp; Glidden had previously served as GM\u2019s executive vice president of legal and policy, but the automaker assigned him his role at Cruise in November 2023, following a Cruise safety incident that led to the company\u2019s downfall.&nbsp; On October 2, 2023, a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian, who was stuck under the car, some 20 feet as it attempted a pullover maneuver.&nbsp; Cruise officials did not immediately share that relevant bit of information with authorities, and when it was revealed, California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission immediately suspended the company\u2019s permits to operate. Cruise then grounded its entire robotaxi fleet across the U.S., and much of its leadership team stepped down, including co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt.&nbsp; After installing new leadership, including a permanent chief safety officer, Cruise was gearing up for a relaunch at the start of this year in Austin. The company had spent much of 2024 testing in Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and the Bay Area and beefing out its safety systems. Two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch the company had been ready to implement a retrofitted sensor solution internally referred to as Project Rhino that would have solved for the October 2 incident by creating additional visibility and awareness underneath the car. In June 2024, GM injected another $850 million into Cruise, bringing its total spend on the company since acquiring most of Cruise\u2019s shares in 2016 close to $10 billion. In September, Elshenawy, president and chief technologist of Cruise, threw a huge party for Cruise staffers that some read to be a sign that the company was moving forward.&nbsp; An earlier version included a statement from Cruise that put the layoff count at 40%. Cruise later corrected their statement to reflect Gliddens email, which said nearly 50% of workers would be laid off."

        "Extracted Article": "Cushion, a fintech startup that described itself as the \u201cPlaid for buy now, pay later (BNPL),\u201d has shut down. On Thursday, founder and CEO Paul Kesserwani posted on LinkedIn about the decision to wind down the company at the end of 2024. In the post, Kesserwani said that \u201cdespite bringing multiple new fintech products to market,\u201d Cushion \u201cdidn\u2019t reach the scale needed to sustain the business.\u201d Founded in late 2016, San Francisco-based Cushion had raised a total of $21.6 million from investors such as Afore Capital, Flourish Ventures, Vestigo Ventures, Better Tomorrow Ventures, and 500 Global.&nbsp; Its last publicly announced raise was in May, 2022 when it closed a $12 million Series A. Its post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook. Kesserwani did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. Cushion offered a consumer app that sucked in the transaction history from its users\u2019 bank accounts, determined what fees had been assessed and then conducted negotiations on their behalf to get a refund. It was designed, Kesserwani told TechCrunch in 2019, to be incentive-aligned with consumers by only taking a commission on any returned cash. Kesserwani got the idea for Cushion after leaving his job at Twitter. While taking some time off to think about what he wanted to do next, he was helping his parents manage their bank accounts while they were traveling for work in Lebanon. Due to bank security policies, his parents weren\u2019t able to log into their accounts from Lebanon, and eventually, they faced a mountain of banking fees as their accounts went unattended. As Kesserwani investigated, he turned to his own accounts, and realized he had also been paying fees to the tune of $400 that he had no memory of agreeing to. In Thursday\u2019s LinkedIn post, Kesserwani said that Cushion had automated bank fee negotiation and reached $3 million ARR in 10 months and processed over $300 million in BNPL loans. He added that the company had onboarded over 1 million consumers over time, with more than 200,000 paying customers. Wrote Kesserwani: \u201cI gave Cushion everything I had for 8+ years. While the outcome wasn\u2019t what we hoped for, we built something that moved the industry forward \u2014 and I\u2019m proud of that. As for me, Im excited for whats next.\u201d Data suggests that 2025 is expected to be another brutal year for startup shutdowns. In late December, another fintech Bench shut down abruptly only to be acquired days later. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech&nbsp;here.

        "Extracted Article": "French food delivery startup Epicery will cease operations Tuesday, after one last holiday season hurrah for its clients and the local food businesses that were using the platform during its nine years in business in exchange for a 25% commission. In a message announcing the decision to customers earlier this month, Epicery\u2019s team said that it was \u201cthe result of the economic and financial challenges we have been facing for several months, and which, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to overcome.\u201d With a focus on premium groceries and local deliveries, Epicery suffered when inflation made customers rethink their food spending. Even after ceasing operations in some cities, it had a negative EBITDA of -\u20ac4.69 million in 2023, on sales of \u20ac2.57 million. Before these difficulties, however, the startup reached unexpected highs when France went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was still riding that wave in late 2021 when Geopost/DPDgroup, the express parcel delivery branch of Groupe La Poste, which handles France\u2019s national postal service, took a majority shareholding in the company. The corporate alliance made sense at the time: Geopost was also an investor in last-mile delivery service Stuart, of which Epicery was a heavy user. But in recent months, La Poste cut ties with several startups it previously invested in, and in particular, sold Stuart at a significant loss. In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Geopost stated that the decision was made \u201cfollowing an in-depth analysis of [Epicery\u2019s] financial and operating performance\u201d leading to the conclusion that \u201cthe subsidiarys short- and medium-term profitability has been severely impacted by developments in the food delivery market, a gradual post-COVID return to direct consumption from local shops, and strong competition in the catering segment.\u201d Food delivery in France in 2024 looked vastly different compared to Epicery\u2019s first years (it launched in 2016). At the time, its competitors included Take Eat Easy, which ceased operations in 2016, but Deliveroo and Uber Eats were nowhere in sight, and quick commerce hadn\u2019t gone through its rise and fall. While Cajoo, Flink, Gopuff, and Gorillas no longer operate in France, their marketing presence was hard to escape for quite a while. In comparison, Epicery\u2019s scale and visibility were always modest. It had some 25,000 recurring customers, buying from some 1,100 local shops, mostly in Paris and Lyon after it scaled back on its national expansion. This could have made sense as a standalone, lifestyle business, but arguably less so as a VC-backed one, and even less so as part of a large group where numbers like these hardly move the needle, especially with the Stuart synergies gone. Epicery co-founder and CEO \u00c9douard Morhange wasn\u2019t able to comment on strategic aspects due to a non-disclosure agreement. In a personal statement, however, he commented on Epicery\u2019s legacy. \u201cIm very proud to have introduced local retailers to ecommerce over the past 10 years, and Im confident that theyll continue to develop their digital sales over the coming years.\u201d Morhange will remain active in the food sector, saying he\u2019s currently working on \u201can ambitious new model that will enable the food industry to pursue its digitalization in France and abroad.\u201d As for Epicery\u2019s employees, Geopost said that each of them will receive \u201csupport from the HR teams to discuss opportunities within the Group or to help them find a job.\u201d French entrepreneur Nicolas Machard, whose food marketplace Pourdebon is also a subsidiary of Geopost, said he\u2019s confident that Epicery\u2019s employees will soon land new roles. He\u2019s also confident that Geopost and Pourdebon are still a great fit, mission-wise and economically. Not only is Pourdebon a heavy user of Geopost\u2019s food delivery service Chronofresh, but it is also on track to reach profitability in 2027, and will likely work on reaching that milestone earlier. Epicery didn\u2019t manage to make the math work on the profitability front, but it sometimes brought up to 10% or even 20% in sales to local shops it worked with. According to Elsa Hermal, who co-founded Epicery with Morhange and VC Marc Menas\u00e9 before leaving operations in 2019, this was a very important milestone. \u201cWhats wonderful, and whats very important to me, is that what we promised [shop owners] at the very beginning, and what took us a long time to achieve, has now become an important part of their business,\u201d said Hermal, who\u2019s now a business coach and impact investor through climate fund Satgana. As an investor, Hermal knows that Epicery was operating in a complex niche, but doesnt think its a no-go. Logistics businesses are complicated and challenging in terms of metrics, but that doesnt mean it cant be done. Now that local businesses have had a taste of this, and in a context where every sale counts, it wouldnt be too surprising to see an Epicery-like model make a comeback at some point."

Bench touted having more than 35,000 U.S. customers just hours before it was shut down, according to a snapshot saved by the Internet Archive. Bench, which had raised $113 million from high-profile backers such as Shopify and Bain Capital Ventures, developed a software platform to help customers store and manage their bookkeeping and tax reporting documents. The move is a shock to current and former customers. Justin Metros, the co-founder and CTO of Radiator, said years of his companys accounting and tax documents are still stored on the site, although he no longer uses the platform. He learned about the shutdown from TechCrunch.&nbsp; \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone just shut down like that,\u201d Metros said. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d&nbsp; Others are airing their concerns on social media, with one posting, \u201cas a customer, I\u2019m pissed,\u201d having just migrated from QuickBooks to Bench. Bench\u2019s notice says its customers should file a six-month extension with the IRS to \u201cfind the right bookkeeping partner.\u201d It also says customers will be able to download their data by December 30 and will have until March 2025 to do so. The notice recommends customers migrate to Kick, a new accounting startup that announced its $9 million seed raise in October 2024 in a round led by OpenAI and General Catalyst. Kick\u2019s CEO and founder, Conrad Wadowski, posted a message on LinkedIn to former Bench users about how Kick is \u201cworking to get your financials back in your hands.\u201d Bench did not respond to requests for comment by TechCrunch as of press time.&nbsp;Wadowski did not respond directly to a question from TechCrunch about details of any possible agreement or other business relationship it had with Bench prior to the shutdown.&nbsp; \u201cAs you saw on the website, were moving fast and are available to support many of Benchs customers with their bookkeeping needs,\u201d he told TechCrunch. Founded in 2012, Bench employed more than 600 staff, according to a snapshot of its About page. The startup was backed by investors, including IT firm Sage, Contour Venture Partners, and Altos Ventures. It was also a member of the TechStars accelerator. Bench last raised $60 million in a Series C round in 2021. Its co-founder and CEO, Ian Crosby, departed shortly after.&nbsp; Crosby posted on LinkedIn today that he was \u201cvery sad\u201d to see Bench shut down, alleging he had been replaced by unnamed board members who wanted to bring in \u201ca new professional CEO\u201d to take Bench in a different direction. \u201cI hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs that think they can upgrade a company by replacing the founder. It never works,\u201d Crosby wrote."

Update: Lilium might be saved after all. The company said in a Dec. 24 announcement that a consortium of investors has agreed to acquire two Lilium subsidiaries, which would allow it to restructure and exit insolvency. The publication Gr\u00fcnderszene was the first to report the layoffs. Lilium co-founder Patrick Nathen confirmed on LinkedIn that the 10-year-old company had stopped operating. After 10 years and 10 months, it is a sad fact that Lilium has ceased operations. The company that Daniel, Sebastian, Matthias and I founded can no longer pursue our shared belief in more environmentally friendly aviation. This is heartbreaking and the timing feels painfully ironic, wrote Nathen. The layoffs cover the bulk of the companys workforce and come a few days after about 200 workers were let go, according to a regulatory filing on December 16. A spokesperson from Lilium responded to an email seeking comment, but didnt provide any information. The company will communicate once we can say something, the email read. Lilium, which was developing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft with speeds of up to 100 km/h, has struggled for months. The startups vision for electric aircraft attracted backers like Tencent and locked in customers, including an order for 100 electric jets from Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company went public on the Nasdaq Exchange via a reverse merger with a blank-check company, SPAC Qell. And while the company had made some progress, including powering up its first full-scale prototype, it was still years away from delivering its product. In October, Lilium said it would file for insolvency \u2014 the U.S. equivalent of bankruptcy \u2014 after failing to raise emergency money from the German government. Under insolvency, Lilium lost control of its subsidiaries, which includes Lilium eAircraft. KPMG was handling the sale process."

Overall, the company has laid off or lost through attrition 40 to 50 people from a total of 200 employees in the cybersecurity team since the start of 2024, according to multiple current and former Yahoo employees who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity. (Yahoo is TechCrunchs parent company.) The Paranoids are not the only team affected by the layoffs. Valeri Liborski, who was appointed Yahoos chief technology officer in September, sent an email this week to employees announcing changes across the broader technology unit, including enterprise productivity and core services. The email to staff, which was obtained by TechCrunch, said: This was a very difficult decision and one I have not taken lightly.\u201d The Paranoids\u2019 red team, or offensive security team \u2014 which conducts cyberattack simulations to identify weaknesses in the companys network before external hackers can \u2014 was eliminated entirely this week, and there have been at least three rounds of layoffs impacting the cybersecurity team this year, according to the sources. Yahoo confirmed the layoffs, including the elimination of its red team, when reached by TechCrunch on Thursday. Yahoo\u2019s security program has matured significantly over the past seven years and is widely recognized as a world-class, industry-leading operation. As part of this evolution, we\u2019ve made strategic adjustments, including transitioning offensive security operations to an outsourced model, said Yahoo spokesperson Brenden Lee. This change reflects the sophistication of our program and enables us to concentrate resources on critical security priorities, maintaining the highest standards of protection for our users and platforms.&nbsp; The company as a whole laid off more than 1,600 employees \u2014 around 20% of its total workforce \u2014 last year, as Axios reported at the time. Yahoo chief executive Jim Lanzone told Axios that the layoffs would be tremendously beneficial for the profitability of Yahoo overall and that the company will \u201cgo on offense\u201d and invest in other parts of its business."

        "Extracted Article": "Monarch Tractor has laid off around 10% of its workforce as part of a restructuring that will see it prioritize non-agricultural customers, license its autonomous technology, and boost sales of its AI-powered farm management software, TechCrunch has learned. Around 35 employees were cut this week by the Livermore, California-based autonomous electric tractor startup that has raised a total of $220 million since it was founded in 2018. Some Monarch workers told TechCrunch they were let go without severance. Its the second cut this year; Monarch previously laid off around 15% of its workforce in July. CEO Praveen Penmetsa told TechCrunch in an interview the company decided to restructure after a slower-than-expected third quarter, and despite raising $133 million in July from the likes of Foxconn and agri-food tech impact firm Astanor. Penmetsa said he was uncertain if employees were let go without severance, but that the company has been trying to help out laid-off workers on a case-by-case basis. All of this happened pretty quickly, Penmetsa said, referring to the recent crash of Californias vineyards, which made up a bulk of Monarchs early customers. That development, plus an ongoing pullback in agri-tech investing, left Penmetsa and his team looking at other options. The industry has slowed down on acquisition of new equipment and new solutions, especially in the core farming sectors, Penmetsa said. But in the meantime, as a platform company, we also have some very exciting non-agriculture opportunities that started sprouting because of our success in ag. He said the company, which has shipped 500 tractors to date, is now focused on widening its customer base in a number of ways. It is expanding beyond agricultural customers to golf courses, solar farms, and even municipalities. Its also putting more focus on selling its WingspanAI farm management software. And Monarch is in talks with other off-road vehicle companies to license its autonomous technology. Penmetsa said these changes inspired the cuts which hit, among other things, some of Monarchs engineering and operations team. He also said that Monarch is leaning more on contract-manufacturer Foxconn, which builds the tractors at its Lordstown, Ohio facility, for operational roles. We are a startup, Penmetsa said. You have to be agile, right?"

In an update posted to its website, Exosonic said it was unable to find the traction necessary to continue operations.&nbsp; \u201cAlthough the founders and team still believe in the need/desire for quiet supersonic flight and supersonic drones for the US Department of Defense, without further customer support for either concept, the company cannot sustain the cash needs to make further advancements,\u201d the update says.&nbsp; Exosonic was founded in 2019 by Norris Tie, a propulsion engineer who cut his teeth at primes like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin; at the latter company, he reportedly worked on the low-boom X-59 aircraft for NASA. Exosonic joined Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2020 cohort and went on to raise over $4.5 million from venture investors, including Soma Capital, Psion Capital, and Stellar Solutions. The startup also bagged several small grants from the U.S. Air Force under its Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.&nbsp; The company was making progress: It hit a major milestone earlier this year when it flew its first aircraft, a subscale variant of its supersonic UAV called EX-3M Trident, in a test flight in California. It also had two other vehicles under development: a supersonic airliner called Horizon and a larger UAV called Revenant. When asked about what Exosonic accomplishment he was most proud of, Tie said, Im frankly just proud of taking a childhood dream and building a company around it. Ive been able to learn so much and meet great people along the way. From a company accomplishment standpoint, definitely flying our EX-3M Trident is the one the team is most proud of. We took an original supersonic aircraft design and flew it (albeit subscale and subsonic), but we did that in roughly &lt;2 years with limited capital. It sounds like the company was ultimately unable to bridge what\u2019s often referred to in defense tech as \u201cthe valley of death\u201d \u2014 the period between R&amp;D and commercialization. This is a well-known problem for vendors looking to sell to the Department of Defense, and a place where venture capitalists have said they could step in \u2014 unless they don\u2019t. As Exosonic put it on LinkedIn, \u201cWithout further government support for its near-term supersonic UAV development, Exosonic can no longer sustain the capital required to further advance the concept.\u201d&nbsp; Tie confirmed that the company has received some interest for potential IP purchases.

Amazon planned to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion, but the companies mutually terminated the agreement, noting that they didn\u2019t see a path to regulatory approval in the European Union. iRobot received a $94 million termination fee from Amazon as a result. iRobot CEO Gary Cohen addressed the latest cuts during the companys Q3 2024 earnings call on Wednesday. These moves, while challenging, have fundamentally changed the way we work with our partners to efficiently develop and build our robots, Cohen said. Our new operating model is able to deliver a significant increase in new product introductions with less than half the internal resources and approximately one-third the cost. Since the start of 2024, the company has reduced its global workforce by approximately 50%."

That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward, read the statement shared with TechCrunch. According to its annual tax filings, the Mozilla Foundation reported having 60 employees during the 2022 tax year. The number of employees at the time of the layoffs was closer to 120 people, according to a person with knowledge. When asked by TechCrunch, Mozillas spokesperson did not dispute the figure. This is the second layoff at Mozilla this year, the first affecting dozens of employees who work on the side of the organization that builds the popular Firefox browser. Mozilla is made up of several organizations, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Foundation, which oversees Mozillas corporate governance structure and sets the browser makers policies. Much of Mozillas work focused on advocating for privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies, and to create safer, more transparent online experiences for everyone, which ultimately benefit the browser maker and its users. Announcing the layoffs in an email to all employees on October 30, the Mozilla Foundations executive director Nabiha Syed confirmed that two of the foundations major divisions \u2014 advocacy and global programs \u2014 are no longer a part of our structure. After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundations work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas, without providing specifics. The move, according to Syed, is in part to produce a unified, powerful narrative from the Foundation, including revamping the foundations strategic communications. Our mission at Mozilla is more high-stakes than ever, wrote Syed in an email to staff, a copy of which was shared with TechCrunch. We find ourselves in a relentless onslaught of change in the technology (and broader) world, and the idea of putting people before profit feels increasingly radical.&nbsp; Navigating this topsy-turvy, distracting time requires laser focus \u2014 and sometimes saying goodbye to the excellent work that has gotten us this far because it wont get us to the next peak. Lofty goals demand hard choices, wrote Syed. Syed, who joined the Mozilla Foundation in February, previously served as chief executive at data journalism and investigative news site The Markup. Updated with comment from Mozilla."

        "Extracted Article": "Dropbox is laying off 20% of its workforce as the cloud company undergoes what CEO Drew Houston calls a transitional period. In a letter to staff, Houston said that the reduction in headcount would impact 528 people. The goal, he added, was to make cuts in areas where Dropbox has over-invested while designing a flatter, more efficient team structure. As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I\u2019m truly sorry to those impacted by this change, he wrote. This market is moving fast and investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into this space. This both validates the opportunity weve been pursuing and underscores the need for even more urgency, even more aggressive investment, and decisive action. According to a filing with the SEC, Dropbox estimates itll lay out total cash expenditures of $63 million to $68 million on the layoffs, primarily in the form of severance and benefits, and recognize $47 million to $52 million of incremental expense. Most of the payouts will occur in Q4 2024, with the remainder to be recognized in H1 2025. Affected employees will receive severance, equity, and transition payments, as well as certain healthcare benefits and job placement services. Dropbox has struggled to grow in recent months, losing market share to rivals, including Box and Google Drive. In its most recent fiscal quarter, the company added only 63,000 new users \u2014 a fraction of its roughly 18 million user base \u2014 while revenue growth slid to the low single digits. In Q2, Dropbox saw the lowest quarter for growth in its history: 1.9% year-over-year growth to $634.5 million. As of August, the companys shares had lost more than 20% of their value year to date. We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business, Houston wrote. While Im proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in the last couple years, in some parts of the business, we\u2019re still not delivering at the level our customers deserve or performing in line with industry peers. The layoffs come a year after Dropbox let go of roughly 500 employees \u2014 and as the company increasingly invests in AI technologies. Dropbox recently expanded its AI-powered smart organization and search tool, Dropbox Dash, with enterprise-focused features, including data governance controls. In his letter, Houston said that Dropbox plans to share more details on high-level changes and its 2025 strategy in the coming days."

        "Extracted Article": "Rental car startup Kyte, which bills itself as the best alternative to Hertz, is pulling out of almost all of its major markets in the United States and has cut its workforce roughly in half in a bid to survive after exploring a sale earlier this year. The company is shrinking its operations to focus only on San Francisco and New York City (including Jersey City) as it works to reach profitability in the next 18 months, CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch. Kyte has been exiting other major markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Seattle. It started telling customers in Los Angeles that it is suspending operations in that city after November 7, as Curbivore reported Thursday. Volk said Kyte recently cut between 40% and 50% of its workforce. The engineering, consumer, and growth product teams were among the most heavily affected, former employees told TechCrunch. In a capital-constrained environment, where capital is super expensive, we have to focus on our strongest markets, Volk said. Hard decisions had to be made in order to sustain the business here. Volk noted that New York and San Francisco are Kytes biggest markets, accounting for about 70% of its revenue. Kyte raised $9 million in 2021 and closed a $60 million Series B in 2022, all on the premise of being a flexible, easy-to-use rental car service that would go so far as to deliver the vehicle to your door. When announcing the Series B raise, the company said it wanted to be the worlds largest operator of shared, electrified, and autonomous fleets. The company rapidly expanded to more than a dozen markets in the U.S., and started borrowing heavily to finance the purchase of its vehicles. The company struck a $200 million debt financing deal in 2022 with Goldman Sachs and Ares Capital, and another $250 million agreement in March 2024 with Barclays and Waterfall Asset Management. Over the summer, though, Volk said it was becoming clear that the unit economics of Kytes business did not currently work well enough to generate free cash flow in those markets. He said his team explored selling the business at one point but decided to restructure instead in favor of reaching profitability first. That was only going to be possible if Kyte narrowed its focus, he said, hence the restructuring. Volk also said that the company recently completed a new fundraise to capitalize the restructured business, but he said he was not ready to share how much. The rental and subscription car service space has gone through hard times recently, especially for companies that leaned heavily into electrification. Hertz said in 2021 that it was going to buy 100,000 Teslas to fill its rental fleet with electric cars, but the company wound up only purchasing around 35,000. It sold the majority of those earlier this year. Autonomy, a startup created by TrueCar founder Scott Painter, fell far short of its own goal to build a fleet of 23,000 EVs; earlier this year it announced a pivot to selling software services and data. Despite the claims Kyte made in 2022, Volk said his company never got too deep in the process of filling its fleet with EVs \u2014 something that may have allowed the company to attempt this restructuring at all. That was very good, retrospectively, that we did not lose a bunch of capital here on residual values falling down, he said. This story has been updated with additional context about revenue and cash flow in Kytes markets."

        "Extracted Article": "CapWay, a Y Combinator-backed fintech that sought to bring financial services to those in so-called banking deserts, has been shut down, according to its founder Sheena Allen. Allen wrote about it on LinkedIn and confirmed to TechCrunch. \u201cI am proud of the work we were able to accomplish, but honestly disappointed that we couldn\u2019t complete the mission,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI feel strongly that there is still much work to be done in the financial inclusion space, so it won\u2019t be the last you hear of me in regard to fighting for economic equality.\u201d&nbsp; Allen told TechCrunch the company started to wind down last year and waited this long to announce after a possible acquisition fell through.&nbsp; Banking deserts are people in communities, often rural, that have no nearby physical bank branch to obtain a checking account. The term is also extended to people who have difficulty going to a bank, such as lower-income, older, or disabled individuals. Allen (pictured above) launched CapWay in 2016 after realizing the impact that not having a bank account has on some communities, such as depending on high-interest payday loans or high-fee cash-checking services, as CNN reported. CapWay\u2019s company planned to address this population by teaching financial literacy and offering online banking solutions. PitchBook shows the company raised just under $800,000 in funding from investors, including Backstage Capital, Fearless Fund, and Khosla Ventures. It was part of YCs Summer 2020 cohort, as TechCrunch reported at the time. Allen told us there were a few reasons why she shut the company down. She cited the fact that the fintech industry took a huge reputational hit after the hacking of Evolve Bank &amp; Trust and the collapse of Synapse, the latter of which saw hundreds of millions of dollars of consumer funds frozen.&nbsp; After that, many banks that looked to partner with fintechs required the fintech to have a certain amount of money in the bank.&nbsp; \u201cIt takes money to play in a highly regulated industry because you can\u2019t control the changes,\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou just have to have enough money and time to survive the adjustments.\u201d&nbsp; CapWay had to find a new banking partner during this time but needed to raise more money to meet potential partners\u2019 money-on-hand requirements, which it struggled to do. Some investors turned her away by citing that the company lagged too far behind its competitor. But she also pointed out the challenge that has pained many Black founders this past year.&nbsp; \u201cFundraising itself was down for everyone, but it was and is extremely down for Black founders,\u201d she said. Crunchbase found that Black founders raised only 0.3% of the $79 billion that went to U.S.-based startups in the first half of the year. Allen often felt like she was in competition with other Black-founded fintechs for that smaller piece of pie. She wrote in her post that some investors turned her down by telling her that they had already invested in another Black-founded debit card fintech. \u201cSome investors like to group all Black fintech companies into one box, [even] when we don\u2019t all do or operate the same or have the same target audience,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but that was a factor in us being told no a few times.\u201d&nbsp; Allen thanked her team and some of her investors in her LinkedIn post, pointing out that there were investors who \u201cstill called and not only checked on the business and me as a founder but me as a human.\u201d She also thanked her fellow founders who \u201clistened to me rant and called to simply check on my mental state through this process.\u201d&nbsp; But one failed startup \u2014 which is almost a badge of honor in the startup world \u2014 has not deterred her from her love of building companies. She still wants to work in the financial inclusion space and is pondering her next startup idea. She\u2019s currently looking at some potential entrepreneur-in-resident opportunities at venture firms. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough time to wind down your company,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s beauty in the journey even on cloudy days when things seem dark.\u201d"

Founded in 2020, Drata integrates with dozens of clouds, SaaS apps, developer tools, security systems, and more, helping businesses collate the necessary evidence to prove that their data privacy and security practices are in order. While layoffs have continued to plague the tech industry in 2024, Drata reported some impressive growth metrics just seven months back. For its fiscal year 2024 (FY24), the San Diego-based company claimed 100% revenue growth year-on-year, said that it was adding 650 new customers each quarter, and made a string of senior executive hires. Notably, Drata also said at that time that it had increased its headcount by 52% across seven countries over the previous year, a figure that will undoubtedly have grown in the months that followed as it made its first acquisitions starting with Harmonize in April, followed by Oak9 a month later. But growth doesnt necessarily convert into a healthy bottom line, particularly if a company has grown too quickly. Drata alluded to sustainable growth in a statement to TechCrunch after we received a tip about the layoffs. Drata continues its 3.5 years of extraordinary growth and has refined its organizational structure, reducing its workforce by 9%, the company said in an email sent by the companys director of communications, Sophia Hatef. We are incredibly grateful for the impacted employees and their contributions. This strategic move aims to enhance operational efficiency and drive sustainable growth as the company charts its course toward a potential IPO in the future. Drata has raised well over $300 million in funding, the bulk of which came via a $200 million investment in December 2022, which gave the company a valuation of $2 billion. Its backers include renowned institutional investors such as Iconiq Growth and Salesforce Ventures, as well as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner."

Bending Spoons acquired the Dutch company in July for an undisclosed amount. The company confirmed the plans for the WeTransfer layoff to TechCrunch. The staff that is being let go will be informed after Bending Spoons goes through local regulations in different countries regarding layoffs. Dutch media reported that WeTransfer has over 350 employees. Bending Spoons CEO Luca Ferrari said that typically, the company studies the organization that it is acquiring and determines what is the best vision of the business going forward with an aim to operate it forever. Once the vision is clear, we try to close the gap between the status quo and the vision as quickly and as fully as we can. Typically, doing so involves making major changes to many areas, including the organization. While we don\u2019t enjoy making painful or unpopular decisions, we\u2019re prepared to do so when we believe it\u2019s the right thing to do to help the business thrive, he said. Ferrari also noted that in WeTransfers case, Bending Spoons wanted to have a small and focused team. In this particular case, the vision we developed is of a smaller, more sharply focused WeTransfer organization, which we believe will be better positioned to serve WeTransfer\u2019s success with a long-term view, the CEO said. Since its acquisition, WeTransfer has rolled out a new feature to let users extend the expiry date of a link on the app. However, neither Bending Spoons nor WeTransfer hasnt disclosed their plans about long-term product roadmap. The layoffs are not surprising, as Bending Spoons regularly cuts the employee count of companies it acquires in order to operate them profitably. In February 2023, it cut 129 employees from Evernote\u2019s staff. In December 2023, the company let go of the entire workforce of Filmic, the popular photo and video editing app that it acquired in 2022. Earlier this year, Meetup also faced job cuts after its acquisition. In February, Bending Spoons raised $155 million in equity financing from new investor Durable Capital Partners and existing ones, including Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, NB Renaissance, NUO Capital, and StarTIP (controlled by Tamburi Investment Partners).

The company confirmed the layoffs but didnt give more details about the total headcount left nor the reason for the layoffs. PitchBook, however, estimates that Brave has around 191 employees, working out to Brave cutting 14% of staff. The new round of job cuts comes about 10 months after the company let go of 9% of its total workforce in October 2023. At that time, Brave said the cuts were due to cost management in this challenging economic environment. After initially fashioning itself as a blockchain browser and adding several crypto-related features, Brave has more recently leaned into AI with its product releases this year. The company launched its AI assistant, Leo, on desktop, Android, iPad, and iPhone in a staggered release cycle. The company integrated its own search results with its Leo chatbot in June. Users could, for example, use the chatbot to ask about the score of a sports match or get additional context about an article they are reading without navigating to a search page. The company is also selling a Leo Premium subscription for $14.99 per month for access to better models and higher limit rates. Earlier this month, Brave started letting all users link their own models to use in the browser after testing the ability for a few months. Brave has not detailed the cost of developing and running these AI-focused features, and it is not clear if that cost connected to this wave of layoffs."

        "Extracted Article": "Formlabs on Thursday confirmed that it has laid off a \u201csmall number\u201d of employees, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The 3D printing firm says the figure amounts to less than 40 of a total headcount of just under 750 employees. The layoffs occurred in waves over the past two years, and as recently as the last few weeks. A spokesperson for the company confirmed the staff reduction. In a statement to TechCrunch, the spokesperson noted: We routinely review every part of the organization to make sure the roles we have best support our customers and enable us to deliver great products. At the same time, we are hiring new roles across all divisions and geographies and are heavily investing in R&amp;D. While we continue to grow revenue and lead in the additive manufacturing market, we occasionally must make the difficult decision to part ways with a small number of colleagues who are in departments that are below our efficiency goals and/or who are not in the right roles. The MIT spinoff has been a rare success story in the 3D printing market, as the first to bring high-precision SLA (stereolithography) printing to the desktop form factor. Prior to its arrival, that corner of the market was almost exclusively made up of FDM (fused deposition modeling) printers, which deposit melted plastic layer by layer, in a manner similar to a hot glue gun. SLA, meanwhile, uses light to form a resin into a solid, high-resolution structure. Formlabs weathered the burst of the original desktop 3D printing bubble, which saw many companies close up shop. Others, such as MakerBot, were acquired by larger companies. Broader macro issues have caused prolonged issues for much of the competition. More recently, Formlabs has expanded into SLS (selective laser sintering) technology with its Fuse. As the name implies, the technology uses lasers to sinter powder. According to a recent post from the company\u2019s chief product officer, Formlabs currently \u201cships more than 50% of all SLS units in the world.\u201d The company also recently acquired two-person SLS startup Micronics. In recent years, the industry has struggled to broaden 3D printing\u2019s market by scaling the technology for manufacturing. Formlabs has introduced its own high-volume solution (effectively a wall of printers), but the company\u2019s bread and butter has been medical and dental applications like teeth-straightening inserts that require a level of customization not achieved by more traditional manufacturing."

However, it never followed up with an announcement naming the company. TechCrunch has reached out to the company for further details. Founded in 2015, San Francisco-based Tally had raised $172 million in funding over the years. In October of 2022, Tally raised an $80 million Series D led by Sway Ventures. Andreessen Horowitz led its $50 million Series C round in 2019, which also included participation from Silicon Valley heavy hitters such as Kleiner Perkins, Shasta Ventures, Cowboy Ventures and Sway Ventures.

Cisco did not give a reason for the month-long delay in notifying affected staff. One employee told TechCrunch at the time that Ciscos workplace had become the most toxic environment they had worked in. TechCrunch has learned that the layoffs also affect Talos Security, the companys threat intelligence and security research unit.&nbsp; Cisco said in its August statement that its second layoff of the year would allow the company to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies. On the same day, Cisco published its most recent full-year earnings report, in which the company said 2024 was its second strongest year on record, citing close to $54 billion in annual revenue. Cisco chief executive Chuck Robbins made close to $32 million in total executive compensation during 2023, according to the company\u2019s filings. When reached by email, Cisco spokesperson Lindsay Ciulla did not provide comment, or say if Ciscos executive leadership team planned to reduce their compensation packages following the layoffs.

        "Extracted Article": "Rad Power Bikes, the Seattle-based e-bike startup that has raised more than $300 million from investors, went through another round of layoffs in July, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. This is the company\u2019s fifth round since April 2021, when it cut back 100 staffers.&nbsp; Rad\u2019s latest layoffs follow a culling a year ago, when the e-bike maker pulled out of Europe and laid off around 40 employees.&nbsp;Rad laid off staff twice in 2022. The layoffs at the popular e-bike startup come after VanMoof, another venture-backed e-bike darling, declared bankruptcy last year. The turbulence in the e-bike industry has demonstrated that manufacturing and shipping two-wheelers is a tough business to get right, particularly if a startup is under pressure to scale quickly to provide investors with a return on investment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rad did not share how many staffers it cut in July or which teams were affected. Sources familiar with the layoffs told TechCrunch the cuts mostly hit Rad\u2019s product development teams. According to LinkedIn, Rad Power employs 394 people. \u201cEarlier this month, Rad Power Bikes made the difficult decision to reduce our teams size so we can ensure the brands longevity, continue on our mission, and serve our rider community, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. We are doing all we can to approach this very difficult time with compassion and care. We believe in and care deeply about our vision to create a world where transportation is energy-efficient, enjoyable, and accessible to all. We have faced the challenges many businesses have, including rising costs and economic headwinds, and this difficult decision was necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of Rads business.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said Rad will continue to provide service and support to its customers with daily live phone and chat customer service, as well as through more than 1,200 retail and service providers throughout North America.&nbsp; Rad Power Bikes, known for their affordable fat tire e-bikes, has gone through some shake-ups since its meteoric rise to popularity that was fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the company\u2019s founder, Mike Radenbaugh, stepped down as CEO and into the role of chairman. He was replaced by Phil Molyneux, who previously served as president at Sony Electronics and Dyson America. Correction: A previous version of this story stated Rad Power Bikes made their bikes in the U.S. They are made in Asia."

        "Extracted Article": "Match Group announced Tuesday that it has discontinued livestreaming services in its dating apps, resulting in a 6% reduction in workforce. The news was delivered during the dating app giants second-quarter earnings report. The move finds Match shifting its focus to other offerings, including generative AI. The decision to end livestreaming will directly impact dating apps Plenty of Fish (POF) and BLK, which launched a free livestreaming feature \u2014 Live! \u2014 in 2020. The offerings were a bid to encourage users to date virtually during the COVID-19 lockdown. Users could also purchase \u201cLive Credits\u201d to send virtual dates to streamers, similar to TikTok Live. According to posts on their respective help pages, BLK\u2019s Live feature ends on August 19, whereas POF users will be unable to livestream after August 31. Additionally, Match is shutting down the Hakuna app, acquired through its purchase of social networking company Hyperconnect in 2021. The app featured livestreams where hosts engaged with users primarily in Korea and Japan. The company stated that ending livestreaming in a post-pandemic world makes sense, as it was a popular feature when users craved connection during isolation. As the world moves beyond the pandemic, the company has seen a shift in user behavior.&nbsp; In its earnings call to investors, Match Group CFO Gary Swidler emphasized how customer behavior has changed since 2020. \u201cWhen we entered in livestreaming a few years ago, you know the world was different it was pre-COVID and everything else but livestreaming at that point, we thought provided attractive kind of adjacent additional source of revenue for us,\u201d Swidler said. Hinge, another Match-owned dating app, quietly ended its in-app audio and video calling feature last year for similar reasons, as more users have returned to in-person dates. Revenue sharing also played a role in Matchs decision. Livestreaming has the same types of expenses as we see in our other dating businesses, but there\u2019s one significant difference, which is we need to provide a revenue share to the livestreamers, said Swidler. And that can be 20% or more of the revenue, so that\u2019s an extra expense that we really don\u2019t see in our dating businesses. There is also significant competition with social media platforms like TikTok. \u201cThis year we expected roughly a $60 million revenue contribution from livestreaming, but growing that revenue base has become much more challenging in the face of the competition and the changed landscape and dynamics that were facing. Not only that but to reach the scale that we need to reach to achieve even reasonable margins from our perspective, was going to take a significant amount of investment for a significant number of years, even in the best-case scenario,\u201d Swindler added. This decision to end livestreaming is expected to result in approximately $60 million in annual revenue loss. Yet its also estimated to result in $13 million in annual cost savings. Match tells investors that this shift will allow Match to focus on businesses where it has \u201cproven advantages,\u201d such as generative AI.&nbsp; Regarding the job cuts, Match Group plans to redeploy some of the Hyperconnect employees who have expertise in artificial intelligence to popular apps Tinder and Hinge. The company has increased its focus on AI in recent years, including an AI-powered photo selector for Tinder profiles.&nbsp; Speaking of Tinder, the app experienced declines in paid users for the seventh quarter in a row. The figure declined 8% to 9.6 million in Q2, compared to 10 million in the prior quarter. In February 2023, Match laid off 8% of staff, or 200 employees."

        "Extracted Article": "Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky will lay off dozens of staff and leave the U.S. market following a U.S. government order in June banning the sale of the companys software, citing security risks. Kaspersky said it will gradually wind down\u201d its U.S. operations beginning July 20, when the ban comes into effect, adding that its U.S. business is no longer viable. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first broke the news on Monday of the company shutting down its stateside business. Zetter said the number of employees affected by the layoffs is less than 50 in the United States.&nbsp; Kaspersky spokesperson Sawyer VanHorn confirmed the companys statement and layoffs to TechCrunch in an email Tuesday. The spokesperson was also part of the layoffs, said VanHorn. Kaspersky initially planned to challenge the ban, saying at the time the ban was announced that it does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security, and that it would pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships. In June, the U.S. Commerce Department announced the first of its kind ban on the sale of Kasperskys antivirus software to U.S. consumers, citing increased security and privacy risks because the company is headquartered in Russia.&nbsp; \u201cRussia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans, U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, said in a call with reporters at the time. Once the ban comes into effect, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to sell its software to U.S. consumers directly or through U.S.-based resellers of Kaspersky software, some of whom have criticized the ban for affecting their businesses. After September 29, Kaspersky will no longer be allowed to push software or security updates to U.S. customers. That will result in degraded protection from the antivirus software. The Commerce Department said it took a staggered approach to the ban to allow U.S. consumers to find an alternative to Kaspersky software. The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned several senior Kaspersky executives, effectively barring U.S. customers from paying Kaspersky for its software or transacting with any future company run by its executives. Chief executive Eugene Kaspersky was not sanctioned, the Treasury said.&nbsp; The U.S. government has acted against Kaspersky during both the Trump and Biden administrations. In 2017, the Trump administration banned the use of Kaspersky software across the federal government after Russian government hackers earlier that year stole U.S. classified documents from an intelligence contractors home computer, which was running Kaspersky software at the time. By their nature, antivirus products typically have broad, if not complete, access to the devices they are installed on to identify malicious cyber threats. When seen by TechCrunch on Tuesday, Kasperskys products were unavailable for purchase on its U.S. website. For legal compliance purposes, Kaspersky products cannot be purchased from your country, its website reads. Updated with Kaspersky comment.

        "Extracted Article": "Indian edtech giant Unacademy is laying off about 250 employees. This is the latest in a series of job cuts at the company after schools reopened across the country following the pandemic lockdowns. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, valued at $3.4 billion in its last funding in 2021, is letting go of 100 people in marketing, business and product, and about 150 in sales, according to a source familiar with the situation. The layoffs bring Unacademys total job cuts to about 2,000 since the second half of 2022. An Unacademy spokesperson confirmed the layoffs but didnt elaborate on how many individuals were impacted. The spokesperson said the restructuring exercise was necessary for staying on the companys goal of reaching profitability. The startup counts General Atlantic, SoftBank and Peak XV among its backers. The layoffs come in the midst of a potential merger discussion with K12 Techno, which owns school chain Orchid International, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Edtech firms across the world saw their fortunes skyrocket as students signed up for courses en masse during the pandemic lockdowns. But once schools reopened, these firms saw enrollment crater. Notably, the sudden collapse of Byjus, once the countrys most valuable startup, has shaken confidence in the sector to an extent. Prosus, the largest external investor of Byjus, last month wrote down its 9.6% stake in the startup to zero amid growing troubles and governance issues at the Indian firm. Unacademy, which offers online courses for Indias most competitive exams, has been cutting costs for two years while also expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint and experiences. Gaurav Munjal, the companys co-founder and CEO, said in an X thread last week that an offline play was a must for businesses building in India. He also said startups raised capital in 2021 at bloated valuations, adding, This is not market correction. This is the reality. 2021 wasnt. He also alleged that Byjus failed because its founder didnt listen to anyone. He put himself on a pedestal and stopped listening. Don\u2019t do that, Munjal wrote. Never do that. Don\u2019t listen to everyone but have people who can give you blunt feedback."

        "Extracted Article": "The Indian social media platform Koo, which positioned itself as a competitor to Elon Musks X, is ceasing operations after its last-resort acquisition talks with Dailyhunt collapsed. Despite securing over $60 million in funding from prominent investors, including Accel and Tiger Global, Koo faced significant challenges in expanding its user base and generating revenue over the past two years. TechCrunch exclusively reported in February that Koo was engaging with Dailyhunt, an internet media startup valued at $5 billion, for a potential sale. The talks didnt materialize into a deal, Koo founders said Wednesday. We explored partnerships with multiple larger internet companies, conglomerates and media houses but these talks didnt yield the outcome we wanted, Koo founders Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka wrote in a LinkedIn post. Most of them didnt want to deal with user generated content and the wild nature of a social media company. Koo sought to win users in India by giving them an X-like platform where they could express themselves in multiple local languages. Koo initially gained popularity in India during a period of tension between Twitter and the Indian government. The conflict emerged after Twitter challenged the governments opaque requests for content removal. Last year Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey alleged that the Indian government had threatened to shut down the social network in the country and raid the homes of its employees. (The Indian government refuted Dorseys allegations and a top minister at the time said Dorsey was attempting to brush out that very dubious period of Twitters history.) Koo took advantage of the situation and positioned itself as a more compliant alternative, pledging to adhere to local regulations. This approach attracted numerous high-profile Indian politicians to the platform, though nearly none from the opposition party. The startup had also expanded its eponymous app to Brazil. But a prolonged funding winter, which forced startups globally to scale their revenue and improve their finances, got the better of us, Koo founders said. For years, Indian entrepreneurs and investors have raced to create homegrown alternatives to popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube. Its becoming increasingly evident that these established American companies are demonstrating superior capability in serving even the most diverse segments of the Indian market."

The news doesnt come completely out of the blue, as Care/of had previously disclosed in a New York Department of Labor filing that it planned to lay off all 143 employees by July 3 due to a funding loss. Now the company is being more specific and definitive about the closure, with a post yesterday on Instagram thanking customers and saying, We unfortunately no longer have funding to operate in the way we have been. The post doesnt completely close the door on a revival, claiming, We are actively exploring options for the brand but do not have anything definitive to communicate at this time. We hope to be in a place to share more soon. Founded in 2016 by Craig Elbert and Akash Shah, Care/of asked customers to fill out a quiz about their lifestyle and values, which it used to recommend a personalized mix of vitamins and supplements. Its investors included Juxtapose, Goodwater Capital, Tusk Venture Partners, Bullish, and RRE Ventures; they funded the company to the tune of $46 million altogether. Pharmaceutical giant Bayer acquired a 70% stake in Care/of in 2020 in a transaction that was reportedly valued at $225 million. Earlier this month, Bayers director of strategic communications Christin Miller told NutraIngredients that ceasing further investment in Care/of will allow Bayer to better invest in future innovations at help people manage their personalize health."

        "Extracted Article": "New York-based Revel has made a lot of pivots since initially launching in 2018 as a dockless e-moped sharing service. The BlackRock-backed startup briefly stepped into the e-bike subscription business. It launched and now operates a handful of electric vehicle charging stations across the five boroughs. And it started an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hail service, in part so its charging infrastructure would see guaranteed utilization.&nbsp; After dropping the moped-sharing business in 2023, Revel is pivoting once again to abandon one of the main things that made its ride-hail service unique: The startup is laying off its 1,000+ drivers and embracing a gig worker model similar to that of rivals Lyft and Uber. The move comes after Revel successfully piloted the model in late February with 100 Revel drivers and has since brought on 100 more. \u201cThe reason we ran this pilot in the first place was just increasing feedback from our driver pool, as well as in our recruitment efforts,\u201d Haley Rubinson, vice president of corporate affairs at Revel, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe leading reason people didn\u2019t want to join Revel was the lack of flexibility.\u201d Rubinson, who was Revel\u2019s first hire, said that drivers were initially attracted to the platform because they didn\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of owning or renting their own vehicles, buying insurance, and managing their own expenses. Drivers have also told TechCrunch that filing their 1099 taxes can be frustrating. But now, Rubinson says, Revel is having trouble recruiting drivers to its platform.&nbsp; \u201cWe have to be responsive to what the industry is telling us,\u201d said Rubinson.&nbsp; In the email sent to employees that TechCrunch has viewed and Bloomberg first reported on, Keith Williams, vice president of ride-share operations, said that four out of the five drivers who piloted the gig worker model would recommend the program. The question of flexibility has been at the heart of the debate over whether ride-hail drivers should be classified as gig workers or employees. If salaried employees are in fact asking to be made into contractors, Revel\u2019s switch could lend credibility to arguments made by Uber and Lyft as the companies fight across the country to maintain their current gig worker models.&nbsp; \u201cNow there really is the opportunity to serve more of the city\u2019s for-hire vehicle population,\u201d said Rubinson. Current drivers on Revel\u2019s payroll will have the option of staying on with the company as independent contractors after September 12, when the switch will take effect. Drivers can sign up to rent from Revel\u2019s fleet of Teslas for $10 per hour, which includes auto liability insurance, vehicle cleaning and maintenance and a full day of battery charging.&nbsp; In 2025, Revel will open up the platform to drivers with their own EVs, giving the startup an asset-light way to grow the business and offer riders a better service. Revel has made over 2.5 million rides with its fleet of 550 Teslas, but customer wait times have been a problem with such a small fleet. Especially when compared to Uber and Lyft, whose driver numbers are collectively over 100,000 in NYC, according to the companies. That said, Rubinson says Revel\u2019s ride-hail portion of the business recently hit gross margin positivity and was tracking to be EBITDA positive by the end of the year.&nbsp; The increased fleets may also help Revel with its actual long-term bet \u2014 EV charging infrastructure. In 2022, Frank Reig, Revel\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch that over 90% of its charging hub utilization came from Revel\u2019s own ride-hail fleet. That number has since shifted to about 50% as EV adoption increases, according to Robert Familiar, Revel\u2019s senior corporate affairs manager. Revel has three active EV charging hubs in NYC \u2014 two in Brooklyn (Bed Stuy and South Williamsburg) and one in Long Island City, Queens. The startup aims to launch another hub this summer at Pier 36 in Lower Manhattan right off FDR Drive, a highway that runs along the East River. Rubinson said Revel also plans to launch three more: One near LaGuardia Airport; another in Maspeth, Queens, that\u2019ll be the largest site with 60 plugs; and another in the Bronx.&nbsp; Outside of New York, Revel is eyeing San Francisco and Los Angeles.&nbsp; In total, Revel has raised around $214 million since its launch, per Crunchbase data. TechCrunch has reached out to backers at BlackRock, Toyota Ventures and Maniv to learn how investors view the startup\u2019s latest shift but did not hear back in time.&nbsp;"

        "Extracted Article": "It\u2019s not just instant-delivery startups that are struggling. Oda, the Norway-based online supermarket delivery startup, has confirmed layoffs of 150 jobs as it drastically scales back its expansion ambitions to focus on just two markets, its home base and Sweden, the home base of Mathem, an online grocery retailer that Oda merged with last year. Oda, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and was once valued as high as $900 million in a round led by SoftBank in its Vision Fund investment heyday, now says its aim is to become profitable in the two countries sometime next year. Oda\u2019s retreat mirrors what we\u2019ve seen play out in the instant grocery delivery space, where a number of startups have either sold down or been acquired for pennies on each dollar raised as they have struggled to get the unit economics to work amid sluggish growth. That all appeared to come to a major head in April, when Getir, the startup out of Turkey that raised $2.3 billion, announced layoffs and a retreat to its home market in pursuit of getting out of the red.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grocery is the largest category in retail, but even the most capable organizations in the world have struggled to find an online model that works. Online grocery is hard \u2014 complex orders with perishable items and a multi-temperature supply chain in a highly price sensitive category, Odas CEO, Chris Poad, wrote on LinkedIn last week (before the layoffs were announced). Poad\u2019s very presence at the company is part of its efforts to get out of that \u201cstruggle.\u201d With past experience at Amazon, Tesco and Google, Poad only joined the company in April himself, taking over from co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas. Munthe-Kaas, meanwhile, left after he was reportedly asked by the board to step aside due to what Norwegian media described as Oda\u2019s foreign fiasco. In short, Oda, riding on hundreds of millions in funding and the pandemic boom for online grocery delivery, had big ambitions to scale across the Nordics and Northern Europe. But in 2023, the company announced plans to end its retail operations in Finland after just one year; Germany soon followed. Oda may have been retrenching its own-brand expansions, but it was also consolidating with other, existing grocery retailers: Its merger with Sweden\u2019s Mathem came later in 2023 \u2014 a deal that Oda claimed would make it the largest online grocery retailer in the Nordics with over NOK 5 billion ($471 million) in revenue. Now Oda\u2019s confirmed its international expansion strategy is postponed. The company\u2019s state of affairs is a stark reminder of both the exuberance of investors pre-2022, as well as the difficulties that have followed as startups failed to meet growth projections.&nbsp; Prior to the pandemic, Oda \u2014 founded in 2013 \u2014 carved out a place for itself as one of the strong regional players in online grocery delivery in Europe. (Others include Ocado out of the U.K., Rohlik in the Czech Republic, Picnic in the Netherlands and Everli in Italy.) Cue the pandemic and a massive surge of online shopping as people sheltered in place. By 2021, SoftBank, via its Vision Fund, led a $265 million round for the company at a valuation of $900 million. But by late 2022 Oda was raising $151 million at a valuation of $353 million.&nbsp; Now, based on recent financial reporting from Kinnevik, its largest shareholder, the companys pre-layoffs value would have been just SEK 2.56 billion, or $245 million. Oda, the Norwegian grocery delivery startup, raises a fresh $151M, but at a lowered valuation of $353M Layoffs are often one of the signals not just of a company looking to cut costs, but also sometimes of one looking to firm up its balance sheet ahead of a fundraise. And that\u2019s what it looks like Oda is trying to do now, based on one report. Local publication E24 says Kinnevik and other existing backers Summa Equity and Verdane are expected to provide the bulk of the NOK600 million ($57 million) Oda is reportedly raising. It is unclear what that will translate to in terms of valuation given the other developments."

Engineering and product design were among the departments impacted by the cuts, according to posts on LinkedIn from impacted employees. TechCrunch was unable to independently verify the exact number of people who were cut, but an industry source who knew impacted people believes it was approximately half of Jasper Healths small team. According to PitchBook data, Jasper Health had about 48 employees before the cuts. The companys co-founder and CEO, Adam Pellegrini, didnt respond to TechCrunchs request for comment. TechCrunchs attempts to reach Jasper Healths chief operating officer, chief growth officer, and head of marketing via email were unsuccessful, with messages bouncing back. A little over two years ago, in February 2022, Jasper Health raised a $25 million Series A led by General Catalyst, with participation from Human Capital, W Health Ventures, Redesign Health and 7wireVentures. At that time, the company said it raised a total of $31 million in venture capital. Most significantly, Jasper is a General Catalyst portfolio company. The VC firm is one of the most active healthcare investors. It is so serious about bringing new startup-led technology into the US healthcare system that earlier this year, the VC firm purchased an Ohio-based health system called Suma Health, an unprecedented move in venture capital. But clearly, that doesnt mean that all GC-backed health tech startups will flourish up-and-to-the-right without setbacks. Jasper is also notable because it was conceived and launched in 2018 by Redesign Health, a venture firm and studio that creates new healthcare companies. Run by CEO Brett Shaheen (previously at Lone Pine Capital and Carlyle Group), Redesign says its built 50 healthcare startups that have collectively raised $1.3 billion. Redesign, which is itself backed by LPs like General Catalyst, CVS Health Ventures, and Samsung Next, also had its own layoffs earlier this year, Fierce Healthcare reported. Jaspers digital but human-led platform offers care navigation, patient support and remote patient monitoring. The company also provides psychosocial care. It says that approximately 12% of its users are in remission from cancer. Pelligrini, the companys founder, started his career as a surgical specialist in the US Army. He also helped build the American Cancer Societys website, which provides information to patients and caregivers about the disease. Before founding Jasper, he was the senior vice president of virtual care and consumer health innovation at CVS Health. Jasper Healths competitors include Thyme Care and Reimagine Care."

        "Extracted Article": "Struggling EV startup Fisker has laid off hundreds of employees in a bid to stay alive, as it continues to search for funding, a buyout or prepare for bankruptcy. Workers suspected layoffs were coming when the company directed everyone to work from home on Wednesday an out-of-character directive, according to multiple current and former employees. The layoffs were announced during an all-hands meeting held Wednesday morning. Founder and CEO Henrik Fisker told employees that the large investor his company owes money to and the chief restructuring officer working on the investors behalf wanted to let more people go, according to employees who attended. Fisker has never disclosed who is ultimately behind the convertible debt investment in question, though Henrik Fisker did reference Heights Capital Management during Wednesdays meeting when discussing the layoffs, according to the two employees. Heights Capital Management is an affiliate of financial services giant Susquehanna International Group. One current and one laid off employee estimated that only about 150 people remain at the company. Fisker has already gone through several rounds of layoffs. It&nbsp;announced cuts&nbsp;of 15% in February. Fisker employed 1,135 people as of April 19, according to a regulatory filing. Those workforce numbers were reduced by an unknown amount after another round of layoffs in late April, and another series in late May before Wednesdays cuts. Fisker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Restructuring officer John DiDonato also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DiDonato previously told Californias Employment Development Department on April 29 that it planned to lay off more than 300 workers on June 28 if the company was unable to address its operating cash requirements, according to documents obtained by TechCrunch. Despite the widespread cuts, Henrik Fisker struck a somber-but-determined tone during the call, according to sources. At one point, he noted that the company built something great and would continue to sell its one and only EV \u2014 the Ocean SUV \u2014 to people who want to buy them. He also suggested that laid off workers would be re-hired once the company is back up and running, according to the account of one person who attended the meeting. Many workers initially learned they were laid off after losing access to Microsoft services like Teams or Outlook. Later in the day, some employees received an email officially announcing they were terminated with one week of severance. Laid-off employees echoed similar details in posts on LinkedIn. These new layoffs come after months of troubles at Fisker, and less than a year after the company began full-scale deliveries of the Ocean SUV."

Per an email sent out to staffers Thursday afternoon by current CEO Gary Little and viewed by TechCrunch, 105 employees were just let go as the company seeks to \u201cstreamline\u201d its operations, and \u201cset the company on more sustainable financial footing.\u201d Impacted employees saw their system access removed upon receipt of Foursquare\u2019s notification email. Little didnt return a request for comment by the time of this post\u2019s publication on Thursday evening, and his letter to employees doesn\u2019t shed much light on Foursquare\u2019s go-forward plan. According to one source, the layoffs represent roughly 25% of the companys employees. The letter does, however, address which units were impacted and, relatedly, the divisions that Foursquare plans to ditch, including Visits, OCF, and Foursquare City Guide.&nbsp; According to Little\u2019s letter, Foursquare is also pausing work on a number of other initiatives, including \u201cMobile Developers Tools, Geode, and the current version of FSQ Insights.\u201d&nbsp; Foursquare, a darling during the earlier days of the iPhone that invited users to \u201ccheck in\u201d at locations to earn badges, and which relied on hyperlocal ad revenue to fuel its business, later evolved into an enterprise tech company that sees brands and publishers leverage its data. For example, Atmosfy, a seed-funded short-form video platform that invites users to explore local businesses, uses Foursquares API to bolster its own app. After its merger with Factual, whose location software helped marketers zero in on customer segments \u2013 say, people in the market for a new home \u2014 Foursquare moved even further in that same direction.&nbsp; Today\u2019s layoffs aren\u2019t the first to hit Foursquare. Employees were laid off at the time of the merger and some reported a separate round of layoffs in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp; Little stepped into the role of CEO in late 2020, roughly six months after Foursquare\u2019s all-stock merger with Factual was announced (the combined outfit ditched the Factual brand). The financial terms of the deal were never disclosed, but Little was largely installed to protect and grow an investment in Foursquare by The Raine Group, a merchant bank where Little was previously a managing director and which led a $150 million round of funding in Foursquare in 2019.&nbsp; Foursquare has not publicly reported a new funding round since that time. The 15-year-old company has raised an estimated $400 million over the years."

TechCrunch has learned that the company on Tuesday laid off roughly 30% of its staff, or north of two dozen employees. Silo has confirmed the headcount reductions, clarifying the cuts were across the board and not focused on individual departments. Silo shared the following statement with TechCrunch regarding the layoffs: We recently made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by almost 30%. We are committed to supporting those team members impacted and have provided severance packages and recruiting support. At the same time, Silo remains dedicated to serving our customers and the perishables industry at large, and will continue to focus more nimbly on building next-generation supply chain management software solutions. Founded in 2018, Silos platform helps automate the workflows of food and agricultural businesses and later expanded into other areas, like payment products for accounts payable and receivable automation, inventory management, ledger accounting, financing and more. Ahead of the layoffs was an issue around a lending product that had hurt Silos revenue. A company source confirmed that a customer had become delinquent on their loan, which caused Silos banking partner to pause the loan product. Silo then worked with the bank to resolve the problem with the customer, so the facility has the ability to fund again. While Silo is now able to lend, the lack of payment from that customer and the overall pause in lending was difficult for the business. For that reason, Silo will likely be careful about ramping up the lending product as it moves forward. This all took place in recent weeks. However, its possible that if Silo had implemented stronger risk management processes, it wouldnt have faced the default. In addition, were hearing Silo is engaged in M&amp;A discussions as another possible resolution to its current situation. The company had previously engaged in discussions with potential deal partners ahead of its Series C last year, but the fundraise allowed Silo to pause those talks for a time. In recent weeks, those M&amp;A discussions have picked back up again on the back of new growth the company saw last year as well as the possible need for an exit. The startup raised $32 million in Series C funding last summer. Investors include Initialized, Haystack, Tribe Capital, KDT, a16z and others."

SeekOut laid off 16 employees in October, or about 7% of its workforce at that time, GeekWire reported. After its October staff cuts, the company had around 200 employees, according to the report. &nbsp; The letter said that the company made a decision to refocus and prioritize fewer initiatives that will have the biggest impact on customers and add value to the business. This reduction is a strategic measure aimed at strengthening our financial position and maintaining our competitive edge in the talent acquisition and management segments. Departing employees are receiving extensive support, Sam Shaddox, SeekOuts general counsel and chief privacy officer, told TechCrunch in an email.&nbsp; SeekOut was last valued at over $1.2 billion in January 2022, when it raised a $115 million in a Series C round led by Tiger Global. At that time, the company\u2019s revenue was growing 300% a year and its annual recurring revenue (ARR) ranged between $25 million and $50 million. But the recruiting environment has changed substantially since then. Finding talent in areas such as technology has become much easier amid the rising interest rate environment, which led both large companies and startups to pay more attention to their bottom line. Tech giants, such as Alphabet and Meta, have laid off many thousands of workers throughout 2022 and 2023. The trend inevitably hurt SeekOut\u2019s business: The company\u2019s software helps large companies in industries such as technology, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, defense and banking identify \u201chard to find\u201d and diverse candidates.

        "Extracted Article": "Around 550 employees across autonomous vehicle company Motional have been laid off, according to information taken from WARN notice filings and sources at the company.&nbsp; Earlier this week, TechCrunch reported that Motional is pausing commercial operations and delaying plans to launch a robotaxi service with its next-gen Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis until 2026 as it undergoes restructuring. Now, we have more clarity into how deep the cuts are. An employee at Motional who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity said every team has been affected, with high-level departures including the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Abe Ghabra.&nbsp; The technical program management team that deals with autonomy and cloud operations has been cut from 44 to 19, the source said. The Milpitas office in Silicon Valley \u2014 which was home to a division of Motional\u2019s compute design team \u2014 is being wound down, as well, two sources confirmed. Sources also confirmed that the high-performance computing team has been eliminated, including its director, David Fermor. The Venice office in Los Angeles which was a small operations and commercial hub doing deliveries for Uber Eats is also being wound down, sources say. TechCrunch has also learned that the team behind Motional\u2019s remote vehicle assistance platform has been heavily cut. Employees who worked in product, safety, cybersecurity and legal teams were also affected.&nbsp;In a statement, the company noted that all functions of the business received staff cuts. Around 145 of the laid-off employees came from Pittsburgh, according to a WARN notice filed with Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Labor and Industry this week. Most of the employees in Pittsburgh worked on software, according to a source familiar with the matter. Another 129 employees came from Motionals Las Vegas team, according to a WARN notice filed in Nevada. Motionals Vegas employees are made up of remote vehicle assist teams, vehicle operators and testing. According to updated WARN notices filed in California, 52 employees were cut from Motionals Venice office, and another 41 from Milpitas. Both offices had teams working in high performance compute, autonomy, system operations and product, according to a Motional employee. Motional was also testing in Massachusetts, but WARN notices in that state have not yet been filed. One source said the autonomy and infrastructure software teams were pretty unaffected. Still, Motional is left with a smaller workforce to help improve its core technology and business model while holding onto what limited capital it has left.&nbsp; One of the sources at Motional told TechCrunch the company has a lot of improvements to make on its technology. Until this week, Motional had been running robotaxi rides in Las Vegas on the Uber and Lyft networks and delivering to Uber Eats customers in Santa Monica. At all times, a human safety operator had been behind the wheel, in addition to another specialist in the passenger seat to manually log any issues. Meanwhile, Motional\u2019s main competition Waymo is offering fully autonomous rides in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Motional did not comment on any of the specifics in this article, but offered the following statement: We\u2019ve updated our strategic plan to focus resources on the continued development and generalization of our core driverless technology, while de-emphasizing near-term commercial deployments and ancillary activities. This updated strategy requires a streamlining of our teams, resulting in a&nbsp;reduction in staff across all functions of the business. The team members leaving Motional have our deepest appreciation for their contributions to our goals. Hyundai investment Motional was originally the product of a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv. The company\u2019s future was put into doubt earlier this year when Aptiv announced plans to reduce its ownership interest and stop allocating capital to the venture due to the high cost of commercializing a robotaxi business and the long road ahead to profits. Aptiv expects to reduce its equity interest in Motion from 50% as of March 31 to about 15%, leaving Hyundai with the remainder of control. A week ago, Hyundai pumped Motional with a $475 million round and spent another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv\u2019s common equity interest in the company. This follows a bridge loan that Motional secured in March as a stand-in to this other investment to buy some time after laying off 5% of staffers a couple weeks prior.&nbsp; The layoffs at Motional are a sign of challenges in the autonomous vehicle industry, as fewer companies are able to keep spending billions of dollars on a technology that is far from ready for prime time and even further away from breaking even. More details on severance One employee who was laid off told TechCrunch those affected will continue to get a paycheck for 10 weeks with their last day slated for July 6. Rather than a lump sum payment, laid-off employees will get something called \u201cgarden leave,\u201d which means they\u2019ll be paid every two weeks like a normal paycheck, according to an off-boarding slide deck that TechCrunch has viewed.&nbsp; Employees will also receive an additional 28.5% bonus on top of the 20% bonus they received in March. Motional has asked employees to alert the company if they find a new job before July 6 in order to \u201cavoid overlap in employment.\u201d Employees with equity that vested in March 2024 will not be able to be paid out immediately because Motional is still waiting on its valuation to determine the new share price, per the deck.&nbsp; Correction: Information regarding the certain aspects of severance, specifically the bonus amount was incorrectly listed as only 28.5%, when in fact it was an additional 28.5%. Update: This article was updated to include information from WARN notices filed in Nevada and California. This article was originally published May 10, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. PT."

The cuts will affect around 140 employees, and are starting immediately. Luminar is also cutting ties with the majority of its contract workers. Today, we stand at the crossroads of two realities: the core of our business has never been stronger across technology, product, industrialization, and commercialization; yet at the same time the capital markets perception of our company has never been more challenging, billionaire founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a letter posted to Luminars website. [T]he business model and cost structure that enabled us to achieve this leadership position no longer fit the needs of the company. Russell wrote in the letter that the restructuring will make it possible for Luminar to get products to market faster, drastically reduce costs, and set the company up better for profitability. The company said in a regulatory filing that the changes will reduce operating costs by $50 million to $65 million on an annual basis. The company is also reducing its global footprint by sub-leasing portions or the entirety of certain facilities. Luminar will continue to operate its Florida facility, which is used for development, testing and research and development, according to spokesperson Milin Mehta. Luminar announced in April that it had begun shipping production lidar sensors to Volvo to be built into the automakers EX90 luxury SUV. It also announced plans to deepen its relationship with Taiwanese contract manufacturing company TPK Holding. TPK has committed to an exclusive relationship with Luminar, Russell wrote in his letter."

        "Extracted Article": "Sprinklr, a U.S. firm offering a customer experience management platform to global brands, has laid off about 3% of its workforce \u2014 around 116 people \u2014 to realign its customer operations team, the company confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. The new job cuts come over a year after the company cut about 4% of its headcount in February last year. The New York-headquartered company, which counts Microsoft, Samsung, P&amp;G and over 60% of the Fortune 100 companies globally as customers, started notifying affected employees in markets including the U.S. and India about its decision on Thursday, TechCrunch exclusively learned and confirmed with the company through an email. Sprinklr made the strategic business decision to realign our headcount across our customer operations organization, a company spokesperson said. While these decisions are hard to make, they reflect the commitments weve outlined to restructure our business to accelerate our go-to-market efficiencies and better serve customers. The spokesperson confirmed that the job cuts did not affect C-level roles. Sprinklr did not disclose the exact number of employees being laid off. According to its recent 10-K filing (PDF), the company had 3,869 employees worldwide as of January 31. Of the total workforce, Sprinklr had 787 in the U.S. and 3,082 internationally (with 2,276 employees in India). The restructuring will be done in accordance with local and country laws. This difficult, but necessary, action ensures we are aligned to our prioritized growth areas while supporting customers where they live and operate, the spokesperson stated. In March, Sprinklr reported a 17% year-on-year increase in its quarterly revenue for Q4 to $194.2 million from $165.3 million a year ago. The company also garnered GAAP operating income of $18.5 million compared to an operating loss of $1.8 million a year ago. While we will continue to hire in prioritized areas to support our growth, scale, and long-term success, our first priority is to support employees with the greatest care and respect, show appreciation for their contributions to Sprinklr, and to assist them in their transition. We will then continue our focus on strengthening our foundation, fostering innovation and enhancing our execution to drive value for our customers and shareholders, the spokesperson said. On Friday, Sprinklr was trading at $12.10 per share with a market cap of $3.30 billion."

        "Extracted Article": "Ahead of Googles annual I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports from affected employees shared on social media. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go. As we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re responsibly investing in our companys biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead, said Google spokesperson Alex Garc\u00eda-Kummert. To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we\u2019re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers, he added. The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, were told. In one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected a LOT of teams, and that lots of great projects lost people. Were sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond, wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart werent affected any more or less than other teams. We know yall care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem weve built together. Youre nervous. I get it. We get it. Youre betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google, he said. Google also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year. In a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were multiple current and former core devs and steering council members, they said. Meanwhile, others shared on Y Combinators Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy. [D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the marathon, not sprint approach to work. As I said in another comment, its the best job Ive ever had, and Ill miss it deeply, they wrote. Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team, the user, gpshead, also said. Though Google didnt detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale. CNBC reports that a total of 200 people were let go across Googles Core teams, which included those working on Python, app platforms, and other engineering roles. Some jobs were being shifted to India and Mexico, it said, citing internal documents. On social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didnt eliminate its Python team; it replaced that team with another group based in Munich \u2014 at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday. Its a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off \u2014 excuse me, had their roles reduced, and youre asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it, he said. Google said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.

        "Extracted Article": "True to its business concept, Turkeys instant delivery juggernaut Getir rose quickly. Now, with the quick commerce industry in free fall, it is nosediving just as fast. On Monday, the company once valued close to $12 billion announced it would shut down its operations the U.S., the U.K. and Europe to focus solely on its home market of Turkey. The move puts a bitter end to the companys very aggressive expansion strategy that saw it raise billions of dollars to grow organically and also snap up a number of equally aggressive, yet struggling, competitors to position itself as the market leader. The closures look like they will impact at least 6,000 jobs across the closing markets, but according to the company just 7% of its revenues. Alongside the closures, the company said it would get a new injection of investment as a lifeline to extend its runway. This decision will allow Getir to focus its financial resources on Turkey, the company said in a statement. Getir is not the only one in this space raising money to stay afloat while also retreating from global plans. Earlier this month, reports surfaced that Flink, an erstwhile rival of Getirs in Germany, is raising some $106 million, with around one-third of that secured so far. It comes as Flink, too, is consolidating its position. Coinciding with the fundraise leak, the company also apparently liquidated its operations in France. A source close to Flink tells me that in fact its weighing up whether to join up with another company or to raise more money. In other words, the instability in the market is creating uncertainty that is impacting others, too. More details on Getir, including financials: Layoffs: To be clear, Getir has only officially announced cuts of 1,500 in the U.K. in the short announcement that it sent out to journalists: no details on jobs impacted elsewhere. However, reports were surfacing over the last few days that it had started to send out notices to 1,800 employees in Germany HQ of Gorillas (which it acquired at the end of 2022). Weve been told by a source close to the company that the number is closer to 1,100 (one figure may include contractors). Meanwhile, when Getir acquired FreshDirect in the U.S. only six months ago, in November 2023 it picked up 2,300 employees. Add those different numbers together and you get around 6,000, although since Getir was already active in the U.S. prior to that acquisition, there may well be more impacted. A year ago, the company had as many as 32,000 people working for it. Its pandemic window of opportunity: The move is a grim chapter for the startup that was founded in 2015 and saw big traction in Turkey before the pandemic Getir means bring in Turkish. That led to aggressive investment and expansion that peaked during COVID-19, when consumers were shopping less in person in part to minimize infection, in part because shopping in person became really challenging due to supply issues, long lines to stagger entries and more. Just as ride-hailing companies like Uber raised aggressively to finance aggressive growth and competitive fights across the globe, so too did Getir: Between its first outside investment in 2017 and September 2023, it raised more than $2.3 billion from some 36 investors, including Sequoia, Tiger Global, Silver Lake, Mubadala, Goodwater, G Squared and A*. It also made some aggressive acquisitions of competitors to increase its position in the market but notably, it was consolidation intended not just as a power move, but also as a way for other struggling, cash-strapped players in the market to step out of the brutal race. In addition to FreshDirect and Gorillas, Getir picked up operations in Spain, Italy and the U.K. at bargain prices. It was also reportedly interested at one point in Zapp in the U.K. and Flink in Germany, so it definitely saw itself as a consolidator in the troubled market. It was a strategy also taken by Getirs biggest global competitor, Gopuff. Todays news leaves easier waters for Gopuff in the U.S. and the U.K. Its Turkish window of opportunity: This is a grim chapter, but not a final one. Getir also announced that it would be raising fresh money to double down on its home market, a round led by Mubadala and G Squared. Getir did not disclose who else was participating, nor how much it raised, nor whether this is equity or debt, so its hard to say what this means beyond giving the company some runway and a chance to focus on one market that has worked. We have reached out to some of its previous investors, Sequoia and Tiger Global, to see if they would comment on whether they are remaining investors in the company now or whether they have cashed out. Right now, the strategy for the bigger players in the instant grocery delivery market seems to be: accept that our international strategies were not great ideas and focus on just our core markets for now. The writing on the wall: Getir, like its peers in the instant delivery market, has been struggling for a while. In May 2023, it cut 14% of staff and canceled large parts of its geographic expansion plans as it scrambled to right-size the business ahead of more fundraising. Just weeks after that, it pulled out of Spain, Italy and Portugal in July 2023. At the time, it was well understood that it shut operations because those markets were just not thriving, but Getir was indeed trying to close another round of funding, so cutting loss-making operations makes sense in that context. Documents have been shared with TechCrunch that indicate that the company, for the calendar year 2023, made $3.3 billion, with the U.S. and Europe (including the U.K.) accounting for around $1 billion of that across the year. (Its not clear from Getirs statement what the 7% figure relates to. We are asking.) From the documents that we have seen, as of the end of last year, the company was not EBITDA positive in any of its geographies. Big, bad news in the chaotic market for instant delivery services, but given the states of the venture market, the current economy, and consumer behavior these days yes, people buy online, but they are also very much back outside, shopping like before it is likely not the last.

        "Extracted Article": "Ola has let go its chief executive, Hemant Bakshi, merely four months after appointing him to the post, and is cutting about 180 additional jobs, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The move from the Indian ride-hailing startup is aimed at improving profitability, its founder and chairman, Bhavish Aggarwal, told employees in an email on Monday that was seen by TechCrunch. The company is undergoing a restructuring exercise to gear up for its next phase of growth, Aggarwal, pictured above, wrote in the email. The move comes in the wake of Ola ceasing its operations in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand earlier this month. Bakshi, a former executive at FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever, was appointed as Olas chief executive in January this year. Ola, which competes with Uber in India and counts SoftBank and Tiger Global among its backers, is looking to do an IPO later this year after the planned public debut of Ola Electric, a startup that was spun out of Ola. Both startups were founded by Aggarwal, who has since also founded the AI startup Krutrim, which became a unicorn in January. Ola Electric is seeking to raise more than $650 million in its IPO, according to paperwork filed by the firm. Heres Aggarwals Monday email to staff in its entirety: Dear All, In line with our vision to serve 1 Billion Indians, and our commitment to drive sustainable growth and enhance efficiency across the organization, we are undergoing a restructuring exercise aimed at improving profitability and preparing ourselves for the next phase of growth. We have made substantial investments in areas of AI &amp; Technology which has led to significant cost advantages and we will continue to focus on these areas to ensure that we build cutting edge products and services across our business verticals. These changes will result in certain roles within the company becoming redundant. This decision was not made lightly, and we are committed to supporting those impacted during this transition period. Hemant will be stepping down from his role as CEO to pursue opportunities outside the company. We extend our gratitude to Hemant for his contributions and wish him the best in his future endeavors. I am very confident of the strong leadership team which we have built over the last few years at Ola Consumer, who bring in a lot of experience and expertise to their respective roles. They will collaborate closely with me to drive technology-led growth. We are committed to transparency and open communication throughout this process. Our HR team would be available to address any queries or concerns you may have. Thank you for your unwavering dedication and commitment to Ola. Best, Bhavish"

This won\u2019t impact our ability to execute on our contracts with customers or on our mission to bring security and sustainability to the space domain.\u201d While TechCrunch could not confirm the total headcount prior to these layoffs, True Anomaly had over 100 employees as of December 2023, it told the Denver Business Journal. Nearly 30 people were cut from the workforce, according to a post on LinkedIn from one of the people let go. Employees started posting on LinkedIn about the layoffs on April 24; according to those messages, people impacted worked in sales, business development and recruiting. At least some interns were abruptly told the summer internship program was canceled last Friday, on April 19, as well. The internship was set to start on June 1. The Centennial, Colorado-based startup closed a $100 million financing round last December; at the time, executives said staff had swelled to 107 employees. Earlier this month, True Anomaly CEO Even Rogers told TechCrunch during an interview on the company\u2019s first mission that the company was \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d True Anomaly hopes to modernize space defense with its Jackal spacecraft and Mosaic software platform for command and control operations. The startup envisions using Jackals on orbit to approach, image and gather intelligence on other objects in orbit. True Anomaly launched that first mission, called Mission X, on March 4, though it ended early after the company failed to establish reliable communications with the two spacecraft that were deployed in orbit. The anomaly is hardly slowing them down, however. The startup is pushing to launch at least twice more in the next 12 months, aiming for another launch in October, one person told TechCrunch. The person was offered an internship, and spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, saying that a technical recruiter suggested that the internship program had been canceled because the company didn\u2019t have the human bandwidth to organize and supervise an intern project. The team is also starting work on the $30 million responsive space contract that the company was awarded earlier this month, the person said."

        "Extracted Article": "Agility Robotics on Thursday confirmed that it has laid off a \u201csmall number\u201d of employees. The well-funded Oregon-based firm says the job loss is part of a company-wide focus on commercialization efforts. \u201cAs part of Agility\u2019s ongoing efforts to structure the company for success, we have parted ways with a small number of employees that were not central to core product development and commercialization,\u201d the company wrote in a statement provided to TechCrunch. \u201cAt the same time, we are focused on meeting the extraordinary demand for bipedal robots across industrial use cases. That means ramping up production of Digit while continuing to win top-tier global customers, and adding new roles that meet these goals. We believe today\u2019s actions will allow us to focus on the areas that drive productization, commercialization, and production of Digit.\u201d Agility was ahead of the industrial humanoid curve with its bipedal robot, Digit. The firm was spun out of research conducted at Oregon State University. There\u2019s been no lack of interest in its impressive legged robots over the years. Ford was an early champion, as Agility explored Digit\u2019s last-mile-delivery potential. Ultimately, however, those efforts were placed on the back burner, as the company shifted focus to understaffed warehouses. There\u2019s been no lack of funding for Agility\u2019s efforts, despite a general slowdown in investments in and adoption of robotic systems, both of which can be seen as corrections following a massive pandemic-fueled boom. Two years ago this month, the company announced a $150 million Series B. Amazon notably participated in the round by way of its Industrial Innovation Fund. The retail giant subsequently announced that it would pilot Digits as part of its fulfillment center workflow. The pilots have since ended, but neither company has announced next steps. A number of other humanoid robotics firms have announced their own pilots in recent months, including Figure with BMW and Apptronik with Mercedes. Last month at Modex, Agility showcased updates to Digit\u2019s end effectors designed specifically for automotive manufacturing workflows. Agility has also made a number of high-profile hires over the past year, including Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson joining as chief executive, Fetch CEO Melonee Wise as CTO and former Apple and Ford executive Aindrea Campbell in as COO. The company\u2019s jobs page currently lists five open roles, largely focused on engineering and manufacturing."

        "Extracted Article": "ChowNow, the online ordering platform and marketing service for local restaurants, acquired Cuboh, a Y Combinator-backed point-of-sale (POS) platform that consolidates all orders from delivery apps into one place. This marks ChowNow\u2019s first acquisition, which will help strengthen its POS integration solution and help restaurants tackle orders across multiple services. However, as part of the acquisition, ChowNow laid off around 30 employees, bringing the total workforce to 300. Meanwhile, Cuboh\u2019s entire 30-person team \u2014 including marketing, sales, product and engineering \u2014 is transitioning to ChowNow. \u201cWe unfortunately did do a little bit of a layoff as part of the restructuring to best position us,\u201d ChowNow co-founder and CEO Chris Webb told TechCrunch. This comes after the company laid off 100 people in 2022. Webb later told TechCrunch that 60 people were laid off, but that 30 people joined through Cuboh, resulting in a net loss of 30 employees. He also said no further layfoffs were planned. The financial terms of the deal werent disclosed. Signaling tough times ahead, ChowNow lays off employees Launched in 2012, ChowNow connects customers with local restaurants and helps businesses establish an online presence by providing custom online ordering systems and marketing support. It also offers a dispatch system that pairs restaurants with delivery drivers. It doesn\u2019t charge any commission fees like its competitors, and it allows restaurants to keep 100% of their profits. ChowNow considers over 20,000 small restaurants as customers and has helped process more than 250 million online orders. The company says its saved restaurants $700 million in commission fees. ChowNow is a profitable company and has raised around $80 million to date, Webb said. Cuboh is a notable addition to the company. Previously, ChowNow\u2019s dashboard could only manage a restaurant\u2019s in-house menu. Now restaurants no longer have to manually manage all their menus, mitigating the potential for errors and overall mayhem in the kitchen. Menus can be updated across all delivery apps to reflect out-of-stock items and price increases, among other changes. Starting next week, restaurant owners can access a newly launched bundle, \u201cChowNow + Cuboh,\u201d for $275 per month. The bundle combines ChowNow Pro ($199), the companys flagship product that handles all ordering, marketing and operations, and Cuboh\u2019s POS solution, which ranges from $100 to $200 a month. And while ChowNow\u2019s platform already integrates into over 30 POS systems, Cuboh is delivering 14 additional integrations to the table, such as Clover, Lightspeed, Brink, Micros, Revel, POSitouch, Square, Par, Dinerware, Aloha and more. In the future, ChowNow wants to build more integrations, such as one for catering services. \u201cIts getting back to the longer-term product vision of what were building, of being the only platform restaurants need for their entire takeout business,\u201d Webb said.

        "Extracted Article": "Banking-as-a-service startup (BaaS) Synctera has conducted a restructuring that has resulted in a staff reduction, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. While Synctera did not share how many employees were impacted, a report in Fintech Business Weekly pegs the number to be about 17 people, or about 15% of the company. Doing the math, that means the company had about 113 employees prior to the cuts, and about 96 now. Synctera built a platform designed to bring together fintech companies and sponsor banks. It recently announced an $18.6 million extension round to its $15 million Series A, which was announced in March of 2023. At that time, it also announced the hiring of Leigh Gross as its new chief revenue officer and BTG Pactual and Flutterwave as customers. Investors include NAventures, the corporate venture arm of National Bank of Canada; Lightspeed Venture Partners; Fin Capital; Banco Popular; and Mana Ventures. When asked about the job cuts, a company spokesperson wrote via email: \u201cSynctera has conducted a restructuring of the company that resulted in a reduction in staff and we are dedicated to assisting those who are impacted. We are committed to our current line of business along with the addition of SaaS offerings for banks and companies.\u201d The startup is not the only VC-backed BaaS company to have resorted to layoffs to preserve cash recently. Treasury Prime slashed half its 100-person staff in February, a year after it announced a $40 million Series C raise. And last October, Andreessen Horowitz-backed Synapse confirmed that it had laid off 86 people, or about 40% of the company. Figure Technologies, which includes Figure Pay, laid off 90 people \u2014 or about 20% of its workforce \u2014 last July. Meanwhile, Piermont Bank reportedly cut ties with startup Unit, Fintech Business Weekly reported. BaaS refers to various types of business models such as offering bank-like services to other players in the industry; or providing the charter and bank services but not doing the underwriting; or offering banking components, which is more of a fintech that isn\u2019t a bank but provides some bank-like services without a charter. Players in BaaS have faced challenges, especially regulatory crackdowns in 2023. For instance, those providing BaaS to fintech partners accounted for more than 13% of severe enforcement actions from federal bank regulators last year, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence reports. Unfortunately, startups navigating those challenges may need to resort to more layoffs to keep up. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.

        "Extracted Article": "Phantom Auto, a remote driving startup that launched seven years ago amid the buzz of autonomous vehicle technology, is shutting down after failing to secure new funding, TechCrunch has learned. The company, which had raised a total of $95 million, developed a teleoperation platform that allowed a remote driver, sometimes located thousands of miles away, to operate a vehicle if needed. The company attracted a mix of backers, including angel investors and early-stage VCs such as Bessemer Venture Partners and Maniv Mobility, private equity firm InfraBridge and strategic investors such as ArcBest and ConGlobal. The startups last raise was $25 million in 2023. The startup had come close to securing another round of funding, but it fell through unexpectedly, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. At its height, the startup employed about 120 people. Phantom Auto, which had cut staff last year, employed a little more than 100 people as of this week. It was based in South San Francisco. Phantom Autos demise is the latest in a long line of startups that popped up as the autonomous vehicle technology industry gained attention and investment from investors. That buzz, which led to billion-dollar acquisitions and valuations in the industry, faded as optimistic timelines to deploy robotaxis and self-driving vehicles slipped. A wave of consolidation, shutdowns and pivots followed. The difficult fundraising environment in the past 18 months caused another wave of closures. Phantom Auto founder and CEO Shai Magzimof posted Tuesday on LinkedIn that the company was ceasing operations. After seven years of efforts to reshape the future of physical labor at Phantom Auto, weve made the tough decision to close operations. there are various factors contributing to this, including market conditions and insufficient funding, he wrote. I express gratitude to our employees, investors, customers, partners, and all whove joined us on this journey. these times are challenging, but my primary concern is our team. We possess exceptional talent now seeking opportunities in the job market. Im committed to providing references for our employees. personally, Ill be taking a pause to unwind and think about the next steps. Sources told TechCrunch that the company had traction on the customer deployment side. However, it was still reliant on external funding to keep operations going and eventually to scale. Phantom Auto was founded in 2017 and initially focused on applying its teleops technology to autonomous vehicles on public roadways such as robotaxis and self-driving trucks. The companys executive team soon realized that even with its technology, large-scale commercial deployments of driverless vehicles on public roads was decades away. Phantom Auto pivoted in 2019 and started shopping its remote driving system to logistics, specifically forklifts and yard trucks that have no autonomy as well as autonomous sidewalk delivery robots. All of these vehicles operate at low speed and, with the exception of delivery bots, are in confined environments. The company had customer agreements with Maersk, CJ Logistics, ArcBest and autonomous sidewalk bot startup Serve Robotics."

        "Extracted Article": "Yet another AI-powered fraud detection software provider is laying off staff. Inscribe, whose platform works to detect fraud in areas like business underwriting, tenant screening and onboarding, has cut just under 40% of its staff, which equates to dozens of employees. The news follows that of another small round of layoffs at AI-powered plagiarism detector Turnitin, whose CEO had last year touted how AI would enable the company to reduce its headcount. According to sources, Inscribes board recommended the cuts as the current market caused the startup to miss its revenue goals for over a year. San Francisco-based Inscribe.ai confirmed the headcount reduction to TechCrunch, noting that the AI advances in the financial services industry necessitated a pivot to a new product and direction for the company. 2023 was a year of change for our customers and Inscribe, explained Inscribe CEO and co-founder, Ronan Burke. Many of our customers in the fintech industry had to contend with higher interest rates and an unpredictable future for consumers and businesses. Additionally, the advances in AI in 2023 present one of the largest opportunities for the financial services ecosystem \u2014 enabling improved customer experiences, more efficient processes and fairer decisions, he continued. In Q4 of last year, we set out on a new product strategy to align with these two industry shifts, and we have a large product launch planned for later this year related to this, which we are very excited about. As part of the change in strategy, in January of this year, we made the difficult decision to reduce the size of the team by just under 40%, mostly in go-to-market and operational roles, Burke said. The company was already a relatively small operation, with 60 (or more) employees, according to LinkedIn and PitchBook, a mix of engineering, product design, AI expertise, marketing, sales and more. In January 2023, Inscribe raised $25 million in Series B funding led by Threshold Ventures with participation from Crosslink Capital, Foundry, Uncork Capital, Box co-founder Dillon Smith and Intercom co-founder Des Traynor. The round brought Inscribes total raise to date to $38 million. At the time, the company forecast it would double its then 50-person workforce over the coming 12 to 18 months.

Turnitin, a plagiarism detection company whose CEO Chris Caren last year warned that, in 18 months, his company would be able to reduce 20% of its headcount thanks to AI, is today confirming a small set of layoffs. TechCrunch learned that Turnitin laid off around 15 people earlier this year, as part of broader organizational changes. While thats nowhere near the 20% reduction Caren had forecast Turnitin has more than 900 employees, per LinkedIn and PitchBook data its a set of layoffs were particularly interested in, given Carens earlier comments. Speaking at an event in 2023, he noted that Turnitin had a few hundred engineers, but he believed that in 18 months, we will need 20% of those number of people, referring to the engineering staff. And well be able to start hiring a lot of them out of high school versus four-year colleges probably the same for sales and marketing functions, he added. His comments were made during a discussion about how AI would impact the job market by increasing efficiencies. Turnitins software leverages machine learning and AI to detect if a students writing is plagiarized. It sells to schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions and works with partners like Coursera, Blackboard and others. Already, there are some signs that AI is replacing workers. Klarna recently announced that its AI Assistant can do the job of 700 workers, shocking the industry. Turnitin confirmed its layoffs in a statement to TechCrunch, but not the headcount: After careful consideration, late last year, we communicated to our global team our decision to make organizational changes to evolve our business strategy, streamline processes, enhance customer focus and support Turnitins continued growth. With gratitude for their contributions, Turnitin provided transitional support to impacted team members. Out of respect for their privacy, we decline to comment further on this internal matter.

        "Extracted Article": "Web3-enabled fantasy sports platform Sorare laid off 22 employees based in its New York office in February. The move comes as the startup wants certain teams to be concentrated at the companys Paris headquarters to improve communication and efficiency, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. As we plan for our next stage of growth, Sorare has made the decision to centralize some of our functions at our Paris HQ, Nicolas Julia, the co-founder and CEO of Sorare, told TechCrunch through email. This primarily affects our product development team as we believe that bringing that team together in the same space in Paris will allow them to collaborate more effectively as they continue to build best in class products across our football, baseball and basketball offerings. An additional 11 employees in the New York office were asked to relocate to Paris, a source familiar with the matter said. The company will backfill most of these laid-off roles in Paris, according to Julia, with plans to hire more than 20 roles in the next six months. Sorare is not shutting down its New York office. It will keep certain teams there like those that work with U.S. customers or on its U.S. brand partnerships with leagues like the MLB and NBA, according to Julia. Sorares partnerships with these sports leagues are locked in for several years, a source added. While a source familiar with the matter said that these layoffs were not financially driven, the source did add that like many other web3 companies, the time horizon for how long it will take Sorare to reach its growth goals is longer than it originally thought. Sorare\u2019s users can buy and sell NFT cards from other players on its platforms, although Sorare primarily makes its money by issuing and selling new cards. Sorare saw $200 million in user transaction volume in 2023, a source familiar with the situation said. The company declined to say if it was profitable or what runway it had left. Sorare hasnt raised capital since its $680 million Series B round in 2021, which valued the company at $4 billion. According to secondary data platforms, Sorare hasnt been garnering much interest from investors there. To be fair, the declining interest isn\u2019t strictly an issue for Sorare \u2014 web3 companies have largely fallen out of favor with investors. Startups in the category raised $7 billion in 2023, according to Crunchbase data, a drop of 74% from 2022s $26 billion. For context, overall venture funding dropped 38% in the same timeframe. Web3 companies focused on gaming have struggled to find meaningful traction. Last month, video game\u2013focused VCs told TechCrunch that the market for web3 games turned out to be significantly smaller than some investors had hoped. This has become evident. Mythical Games, a web3 gaming startup, raised nearly $300 million in venture money before holding three rounds of layoffs. Dapper Labs, another startup in the category, has also held numerous rounds of layoffs. This is not to say Sorare will see the same fate. The company has an active community of nearly 13,000 people on Reddit posting regularly about the fantasy games and a community of third-party media dedicated to these competitions. Hopefully, even if the web3 winter continues, Sorares reorg will be enough."

        "Extracted Article": "Electric vehicle startup Fisker is planning to lay off 15% of its workforce and says it likely does not have enough cash on hand to survive the next 12 months. The company says it is trying to find a way to raise that money as it works through a pivot from direct sales to a dealership model. [W]e have put a plan in place to streamline the company as we prepare for another difficult year, founder and CEO Henrik Fisker said in a statement. Fisker reported more than 1,300 employees as of the end of September 2023, meaning the cut could affect close to 200 people. The companys share price plunged 35% in after-hours trading. Fisker said Thursday that it finished 2023 with $396 million in cash, though $70 million of that is restricted. The company says it is talking with one of its lenders about making an additional investment in the company. It also claims it is in negotiations with a large automaker for a potential transaction which could include an investment in Fisker, joint development of one or more electric vehicle platforms, and North America manufacturing. A partnership like that will be crucial, as Fisker executives said on a call Thursday that it wont invest any more money in its future products unless it works with another automaker. That means the fates of a pickup truck, compact EV and other models that Fisker has teased are now in question. The companys financial struggles come as it is trying to move to a wholesale model built around partnerships with dealers, a shift that Fisker says has negatively impacted its sales so far. Its currently sitting on inventory of thousands of vehicles that are collectively worth more than $500 million. Fisker says it has received interest from around 250 dealerships but has only signed up 13 to date. Fisker has also been dealing with a number of problems with its Ocean SUV, its only model so far, as TechCrunch reported earlier this month. The company has said it resolved some issues with a software update in December and planned to fix many more in a larger 2.0 update earlier this month, but that only started making its way to customer vehicles this week. It is currently being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for reports of sudden brake failure, as well as for a handful of vehicle rollaway incidents. Fisker Ocean owners flagged sudden power loss and brake problems for months, internal documents show A number of big automakers are pulling back on their aggressive EV targets, and newer players are having trouble as well. Rivian recently announced it was cutting 10% of its workforce and that it expects to make around the same number of EVs this year as it did in 2023. Lucid Motors plans to build around 9,000 vehicles this year after once predicting it would be building 90,000 by this point in time. Fisker has always differentiated itself from other EV startups, though, as it pursued an asset light business model. It designed the Ocean but outsourced the manufacturing to Magna Steyr in Austria. That decision helped it get cars on the road faster than some other startups, though it has imperiled the company in other ways. For instance, its Ocean SUV isnt eligible for the point-of-sale federal EV tax credit because the vehicle isnt manufactured in North America. Ultimately, Fisker said Thursday that it sold just shy of 5,000 Ocean SUVs in 2023 and generated $273 million of revenue, after starting shipments in earnest in June. It lost just shy of $761 million across the full year. Magna produced just over 10,000 Oceans, and Fisker said it hopes to start shipping those to its new dealer partners in order to generate near-term cash. The company declined to say on the conference call how many vehicles its initial partners have ordered or plan to order. Like many other EV startups that went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, Fisker has had a lot of growing pains as a public company. It had to delay the release of its third quarter 2023 financial results in part because it found weaknesses in its internal financial reporting. Around that time, it also had two different chief accounting officers resign. These problems continued Thursday, as Fisker said it will be late reporting its full 2023 financial results. It also revealed it has discovered another material weakness related to its revenue and the related balance sheet accounts. As a result, it couched the financial figures it released Thursday as preliminary, going so far as to append an asterisk to the headline of the press release."

        "Extracted Article": "Motional, the autonomous vehicle company born out of a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, told employees Wednesday it will cut about 5% of its workforce, TechCrunch has learned. The cuts, which translate to fewer than 70 people, mostly affect administrative roles and some employees working in Boston, one of several cities where it tests autonomous vehicles, according to sources who asked to not be named because they are not authorized to speak for Motional. The autonomous vehicle company last had layoffs in December 2022, when it cut about 10% of its workforce. That earlier layoff mostly affected the companys operations in Pittsburgh, where it tests AVs. Motional operates an autonomous vehicle taxi service in Las Vegas (still with human safety operators behind the wheel) on Uber, Lyft and Via platforms. It also has an autonomous delivery pilot with Uber Eats in Santa Monica, California. A Motional spokesperson confirmed the layoffs. Motional recently announced steps to reallocate resources to areas of the company that will directly enable long-term commercial success, including staff reductions that impacted less than 5% of employees working in non-technical roles, Motional said in an emailed statement. We are continuing to hire critical talent needed to develop our technology and meet our commercial goals. We\u2019re confident in our funding roadmap and are well positioned for the next phase of our commercialization. Our team is focused on scaling our driverless services, expanding Motional\u2019s commercial partnerships, and furthering development on Motional\u2019s next-generation robotaxi in collaboration with Kia. The layoffs come one month after automotive supplier Aptiv \u2014 the other half of a $4 billion joint venture with Hyundai that created Motional \u2014 said it would no longer allocate capital toward the endeavor. With Aptiv pulling out of future funding, Hyundai is left as the sole backer, unless Motional is able to court another company to fund its efforts. Motional is also exploring outside funding deals, according to one source. The company has previously said in internal meetings that it had enough runway to last through the end of Q1 2024. Despite its financial woes, the company has continued to make some progress toward its goal of launching a robotaxi service using driverless Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles in 2024. In November, Hyundai Motor Group and Motional announced plans to co-develop production-ready versions of the all-electric Ioniq 5 robotaxi at the automaker\u2019s new innovation center in Singapore, the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore (HMGICS). A production-ready autonomous vehicle, equipped with the kind of redundancies designed for safe operations without a human driver, is a critical milestone required for commercial operations. During CES 2024, the company announced plans to work with Kia on a next-generation vehicle that will enter commercial operations later this decade. The initial development process will begin this year, according to the company."

        "Extracted Article": "Apple is scuttling its secretive, long-running effort to build an autonomous electric car, executives announced in a short meeting with the team Tuesday morning. The company is likely cutting hundreds of employees from the team and all work on the project has stopped, TechCrunch has learned. Some remaining employees will be shifted to Apples generative AI projects, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the projects cancellation. Others will have 90 days to find a reassignment to other roles inside the company, or they will be let go. The car project still had around 1,400 employees working on it, according to one employee who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about their work. The decision to kill the project comes at a time when major automakers are reevaluating their investments in electric vehicles, and amid increased scrutiny on autonomous vehicle projects. Apples entry into the automotive sector was also seen as a possible boon to its bottom line, giving it a new source of revenue to help bolster against stagnating hardware sales and regulatory threats to its services business. Apple declined to comment. Apple first started working on its car project, known internally as Project Titan, in 2014. At one point, it had around 5,000 workers dedicated to the effort. But Apple pivoted repeatedly over the last decade, oscillating between an emphasis on making an all-electric Tesla competitor and a fully autonomous vehicle more akin to what Waymo has created. Most recently, Bloomberg reported in January that the projects leadership was under pressure from Apples top executives and its board to find a way to bring something to market sooner than later. Apples chief operating officer Jeff Williams and the vice president in charge of Titan, Kevin Lynch, announced the news to the team Tuesday in a short meeting that lasted about 12 minutes, and did not take questions, according to the employee. While this person described the announcement as abrupt, they said the decision was not, citing the constantly shifting priorities. A number of high-profile automotive executives cycled through Project Titan over the years. Most notably, the project was once run by former Tesla executive Doug Field (who eventually left to take a role at Ford). Apple also poached executives from Lamborghini and Ford. In 2021, it hired Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive who helped run the i3 program, away from EV startup Canoo. Apple once even held talks with Canoo as it searched the market for contract manufacturing partners, intellectual property, and talent. That search also included talks with Hyundai and Kia."

        "Extracted Article": "Rivian is laying off 10% of its salaried workforce in a bid to cut costs in an increasingly tough market for electric vehicles, putting even more pressure on its future, more affordable EV called the R2. A limited number of non-manufacturing hourly employees will also be cut, founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in a companywide email. This is the third round of layoffs for the EV company since July 2022, when Rivian cut 6% of its workforce. The company cut another 6% of jobs in February 2023. The company more than doubled the number of EVs it built and shipped in 2023 compared to 2022. But Rivian still lost more than $5.4 billion for the year, and announced Wednesday that it only expects to build the same amount 57,000 of electric vehicles across all of 2024. Rivian said it plans to shut down its sole factory in Normal, Illinois midyear to upgrade its manufacturing line with an expectation to improve production rates by about 30%. As a result, Rivian says it expects to lose, on an adjusted basis, around $2.7 billion in 2024, and has decided to continue its company-wide cost transformation program. That includes changes to the design and engineering of its vehicles, making manufacturing more efficient, and laying off more employees. The company said it expects capital expenditures to reach $1.75 billion in 2024\u2014 an uptick from the $1.03 billion it spent last year that will be driven by additional investment in its next-generation technologies, its future Georgia factory and go-to-market operations. The companys production and profit loss guidance combined with the layoffs pushed Rivian shares down more than 15.6% in after-hours trading. Our business is facing a challenging macroeconomic environment including historically high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty and we need to make purposeful changes now to ensure our promising future, Scaringe said in an email to the company. We must strategically prioritize our growth areas of the business, including the launch of Peregrine and R2 as well as investing in our go-to-market capabilities. Rivian reported Wednesday fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion, more than double the $663 million it generated in the same period of 2022. On a full-year basis, Rivian reported revenue of $4.4 billion, up from $1.66 billion in 2022. The majority of revenue came from the sale of its EVs. It brought in about $39 million in the fourth quarter and $73 million for the full year from the sale of regulatory credits. The company reported a net loss of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement over the $1.72 billion loss it reported in Q4 2022. On an adjusted basis, it reported a loss of $1.1 billion compared to a $1.5 billion loss in the same year-ago period. Rivian, which makes an all-electric pickup truck, SUV and a commercial van, has made progress on its loss per vehicle. Although it still has a considerable way to go before it gets close to break even. The company reported it lost $43,372 per unit delivered in the fourth quarter, a more than two-thirds improvement from the $124,162 it lost per unit in Q4 2022. We took significant steps towards driving greater efficiency in 2023 gross profit per vehicle improved by approximately $81,000 when comparing the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter 2022, Scaringe said on an earnings call Wednesday. As we start 2024, I want to emphasize our teams continued sense of urgency and ownership mindset and driving further efficiency throughout the organization."

Co-founder Tyler Huggins will transition into the role of chief innovation officer, where he will oversee the company\u2019s brand refocus as Meati, maker of alternative protein cutlets and steaks from mycelium, or mushroom root, rolls out more of its MushroomRoot product in 2024. The company also said it was reducing its workforce by 13% as Meati works to \u201cbuild a financially sustainable business,\u201d Graves told TechCrunch exclusively. \u201cTo do that, you have to have the right organizational structure and team in place,\u201d Graves said. \u201cIts hard to build something that is entirely new, so we are having a reduction in force. While its painful for all involved its also imperative that we as a business have a clear path to financial profitability.\u201d The company did not disclose how many jobs that entailed. Meati said it had as many as 150 employees in 2022. Severance packages were still being decided at the time of publication. Meati Foods sinks teeth into $150M to expand its mushroom-root meat operations Meati is another example of a tech company making layoffs that didn\u2019t appear to be in trouble. Meati\u2019s Mega Ranch facility scaled production throughout 2023. Products are now in more than 3,600 retail locations nationwide, including Whole Foods Market, Meijer, Cub Foods and Sprouts Farmers Market. Graves even said the company has a goal of expanding that to 10,000 locations before the end of 2024. Mushrooms are big at the moment, too. Companies are turning fungi into functional beverages and leather-like materials, which has resulted in companies gaining success \u2014 and venture capital funding \u2014 for doing nothing more than growing more mushrooms. Meati itself benefited from investor attention. The company raised significant venture capital in the past two years, most recently at the Series C level. An initial $150 million was announced in July 2022, and that round took in another $22 million in January 2023 before ultimately closing at over $200 million later on in 2023. Much of that was invested in the 100,000-square-foot \u201cMega Ranch\u201d facility that enabled Meati to produce an annual rate of tens of millions of pounds of its protein. Once fully ramped up, the facility will have the capability of producing more than 45 million pounds of product, Huggins told TechCrunch at the time. Spacegoods shakes up functional beverage industry with mushroom-based powders \u201cProduction is ramping up as expected; however, the days where companies can raise unlimited capital and defer profitability for decades are gone,\u201d Graves said. \u201cOne of the main things that I am laser-focused on, and the team is as well, is showcasing a clear path to profitability in the next 12 months. We aim to be EBITDA positive, and we have a path to get there. Our ceiling is as high as its ever been with these changes.\u201d Meanwhile, Graves joined Meati this month from Wild Idea Buffalo Co., a company focused on sustainable meat production, where he served as the CEO for nearly two years. He also previously worked at Bass Pro Shops and Patagonia, where he was the founder of its corporate venture fund, Tin Shed Ventures. \u201cPhil is undoubtedly the right person to lead the company forward while I focus on delivering the product and brand that will establish Meati\u2019s long-term legacy,\u201d Huggins said in a statement. \u201cWe are coming significantly closer to fulfilling the reason Meati was founded \u2014 to elevate the health of people and the planet with the boundless potential of nature.\u201d Startups, heres how you can make hardware without ruining the planet"

        "Extracted Article": "Getaround, a company that helps vehicle owners rent out their cars, trucks and SUVs to other peers, is cutting 30% of its North American workforce as part of a restructuring. The company said in a statement it will restructure its workforce and operations to reduce costs in hopes of extending its cash runway and accelerating its path to profitability. Getaround wouldnt disclose the number of workers it currently employs in North America or in Europe, where it also operates. The company employed 283 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022, according to its most recent full-year earnings report. That figure has fluctuated since then due to a 10% workforce reduction in February 2023, which was also conducted to achieve a leaner path to profitability, and an acquisition of Hyrecar in May 2023. Getaround said this latest restructuring will result in savings of about $7 million on an annualized run-rate basis. The company said it expects up to $1 million in restructuring costs in connection with the workforce reductions. Our focus on profitability and sustainable business growth necessitated this difficult workforce reduction program, Getaround CEO Sam Zaid said in a statement. Weve made significant progress over the past year, including steady improvements in revenue growth and unit economics, as well as in overall adjusted EBITDA profile and operating efficiency. We launched a new artificial intelligence model (Trustscore AI) to improve the safety and economics of our marketplace, deployed a powerful new global app that unifies and enables seamless trip coordination across the U.S. and Europe, and expanded to gig carsharing, enabling gig workers across the U.S. to rent cars to drive for services like Uber and DoorDash. As the only truly global and digital carsharing marketplace, and as the leader in gig carsharing, we believe Getaround is increasingly well positioned for the future. Getaround has seen revenue growth, according to its third-quarter earnings report which revealed a 42% year-over-year increase. While progress has been made, profitability is still a ways off. In that same quarter, Getaround reported $42.9 million worth of operating expenses and a $27.3 million loss on a net GAAP basis. Even when using more generous profit calculations, Getaround was still unprofitable in the third quarter, with an adjusted EBITDA of -$11.3 million during the three-month period."

        "Extracted Article": "Electric motorcycle startup Cake filed for bankruptcy February 1, CEO Stefan Ytterborn has confirmed to TechCrunch. The Swedish company was in the middle of a funding round, just prior to the filing, but apparently the withdrawal of an investor was what tipped the company over the edge, according to Swedish media reports. Ytterborn declined to comment on what will happen next. While its unclear if Cake filed for bankruptcy protection or insolvency, Ytterborn did tell media outlet Dagens Industri that he had nothing else in mind but to find a solution in one format or another. His comments suggest the company filed for protection. Best known for making high-design bikes, Cake raised a $14 million Series A in 2019. It followed that with a $60 million Series B round in 2021 led by Swedish pension fund AMF. The capital was meant to fund manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia and to scale up its retail capabilities, the company said at the time. Cake has struggled as of late, though. In November, it issued a recall for one of its mopeds because of a risk that the steering column could break. Just a few weeks later, it recalled its flagship Kalk e-motorcycle after a unit caught fire in a South Korean dealership. Ytterborn confirmed last week to Swedish outlet Breakit that the company wasnt going to be able to make salary payments to employees. Cakes struggles are just the latest in the wider world of e-mobility. Superpedestrian went out of business and Bird filed for bankruptcy. Micromobility.com formerly known as Helbiz was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange. Tier and Dott decided to merge in order to find a better path forward. Perhaps most relevant to Cake, though, is the case of Vanmoof. The high-end e-bike maker out of the Netherlands filed for bankruptcy protection last year. But it was able to find a buyer in electric scooter company Lavoie that has since gotten the brand back up and running."

        "Extracted Article": "Despite record growth in the solar industry last year, software startup Aurora Solar has laid off 20% of its staff of about 500 people, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The company, which provides software to help solar installers manage their sales, project design and installation process, has missed its growth targets for the past year, a source said. Monday\u2019s layoffs follow a smaller layoff of around 20 people in November, they added. Aurora Solar last raised $200 million in a Series D round that closed in February 2022, less than nine months after raising a $250 million Series C. In total, the company has raised $523 million, according to PitchBook. Like many other companies in the solar industry, we\u2019ve felt the effects of larger macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates and the impact of NEM 3.0 in California, Aurora Solar told TechCrunch after publication. In California, the largest solar market in the U.S., changes in net metering (known as NEM 3.0) have led to homeowners getting paid about 75% less for power sold back to utilities. While that hasn\u2019t cratered demand for solar among single-family homeowners, it\u2019s possible the new regulations knocked it off its previous trajectory. The net metering changes generated a surge of interest last year, according to Aurora Solar\u2019s data, likely from homeowners hoping to get in before the new rules took effect. With net metering rates slashed, the state has decided to offer richer incentives for solar installations that include batteries. But many door-to-door sales representatives, especially those who work independently, aren\u2019t as well equipped to sell batteries since they require far more details about a home than solar alone. To design and permit a battery system, sales reps have to calculate the household\u2019s daily energy usage, size up the home\u2019s electrical panel and figure out where to put the batteries. Solar, on the other hand, can often be sold by looking at satellite photos of a home\u2019s roof and surrounding trees and buildings, from which software can easily calculate how much power a solar array can produce. https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/tech-layoffs-2023-list/ As a result, smaller installers have been facing pressure under the new regime. While Aurora Solar says its software is used by 90% of the top 100 solar installers, it also has more than 7,000 customers, many of which likely fall in the long tail of the distribution, those that say they\u2019re under the most pressure. In total, the California solar industry was estimated to cut 17,000 jobs last year. This article has been updated with comment from Aurora Solar."

        "Extracted Article": "Indian food delivery startup Swiggy is cutting about 400 jobs, or nearly 7% of its workforce, as the startup seeks to bring further improvements to its finances ahead of a planned IPO later this year. This is the second round of layoffs at the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which cut just as many jobs early last year. The move comes as Swiggy attempts to further improve its finances. Though its food delivery business has been profitable for several quarters, the startup is not profitable at a group level. Zomato, Swiggys chief rival, became profitable last year. Investment bankers and mutual fund investors hold the view that Swiggy, valued at $10.7 billion in its most recent funding round, will be very closely compared to Zomato by retail investors at the time of listing and needs to beat the older rival on many metrics if it desires a good valuation. Swiggy didnt respond to a request for comment. Indian newspaper ET first reported the layoff. Zomato and Swiggy lead the Indian food delivery market, but in recent quarters Zomato has expanded its market share lead, according to UBS and AllianceBernstein. Zomato held over 60% of the Indian food delivery market, based on app user count, AllianceBernstein said in a note Wednesday. Data/Image Credits: AllianceBernstein Post covid, Zomato has grown faster than Swiggy \u2014 both from a user base &amp; GMV perspective driven by strong execution, wider penetration (Zomato is present in 750+ cities as compared to ~600 cities for Swiggy) and stronger content funnel, AllianceBernstein analysts wrote. In the past three months, Zomato has incrementally gained ~100bps in market share in terms of monthly active users (MAUs). From a GMV perspective, Zomato holds ~54% share in food delivery as compared to Swiggy at 46% as of 1HCY23, Zomato\u2019s food delivery GMV stood at $1.7Bn as compared to Swiggy\u2019s $1.4Bn. Zomato has been a gainer in Tier 2+ cities as well as some Tier 1 cities \u2014 which has led to a higher MAU base for Zomato. Zomato had 58Mn annual transacting users in CY22, with food delivery segment exhibiting18.4Mn MTUs in Q2FY24."

As first reported by The Information, these layoffs came after Veho grew revenue nearly 90% in 2023. \u201cWe conducted a reorganization of our corporate team to improve efficiencies, accelerate our path to profitability and be able to invest more in areas that directly impact our clients needs and our growth,\u201d according to a company statement sent to TechCrunch. The logistics technology company, founded in 2016 by Itamar Zur and Fred Cook, is going after the last-mile section of delivery \u2014 how packages get from fulfillment centers to the customer\u2019s door. In early 2022, Veho was not in a bad way. The company had grown 40% in revenue and 20% in its customer base from the year prior. There were also plans to jump from 500 employees to 2,000 by the end of 2022. It also was lucky in venture capital during the pandemic as shopping shifted online. At that time, the company raised $170 million in Series B funding in a round, led by Tiger Global Management, that bumped up the company\u2019s valuation to $1.5 billion. Another huge funding round gives Veho room to deliver That was after announcing $125 million in Series A funding two months prior, the round that pushed Veho into unicorn territory. General Catalyst led that round. With now over $300 million in venture-backed funding at its disposal, Veho added markets and brought on a number of executives at the end of 2022, including Eric Swanson as chief commercial officer and Brian McDevitt as chief revenue officer. In the summer of 2023, the company went into 11 New England markets and was working with customers like Kroger, Saks, Nordstrom, Misfits Market, HelloFresh and Nespresso. At that time, Veho said it had 910 employees across corporate and warehouse teams and was looking to fill additional positions. Even with the continued growth, the company wasn\u2019t without problems last year, according to The Information. Those included laying off customer and driver support staff and shifting those jobs overseas. Then Swanson left in March, according to his LinkedIn profile. In December, Veho appointed Deborah Surrette, a former vice president of sales at Oracle, to that role. McDevitt\u2019s social media profiles still say he is CRO, however, The Information reported he left as well. Increased freight rates and consolidation continue to affect the logistics industry, so we\u2019ll have to see what happens. Veho remains optimistic, telling TechCrunch that its capital position \u201cis very strong and we are building on our strong momentum and record peak season in 2023.\u201d Time for moderation?"

        "Extracted Article": "Aurora Innovation, the autonomous vehicle technology company aiming to launch a driverless self-driving trucks business by the end of 2024, laid off dozens of workers this month, according to sources familiar with the action. The Pittsburgh-based company, which also has facilities in California, Colorado, Texas and Montana, has since confirmed that about 3% of its workforce was laid off in the beginning of the year, following an organizational review. Aurora employed about 1,800 workers as of the end of 2023, according to the company. As we move toward commercial launch, we recently reviewed the entire organization to ensure we are working as effectively as possible and with the velocity required to achieve our ambitious goals, according to an emailed statement attributed to Auroras senior vice president of people Cristopher Barrett. Through this process, a limited number of roles were eliminated which impacted 3 percent of our total workforce. During the recent market uncertainty, we have been incredibly thoughtful in our resourcing in order to minimize such actions. We are grateful for the contributions of these individuals and are supporting them through this transition. The layoffs come as Aurora presses forward with plans to deploy a fleet of self-driving trucks that can navigate U.S. highways without a human driver behind the wheel. The company has said it expects to launch up to 20 driverless Class 8 trucks by the end of 2024. Initially, these driverless trucks meaning no human behind the wheel \u2014 will carry freight between Dallas and Houston, a route the company has been using for testing. Aurora is also working with automotive supplier Continental on a more than $300 million project to mass produce autonomous vehicle hardware for commercial self-driving trucks. Aurora recently wrapped up the first phase of the project, which allows Continental to work on developing prototypes ahead of its plan to begin production in 2027. Developing autonomous vehicle technology that is safe enough for public roads has proven to be an expensive endeavor that has led to numerous startups shutting down or being acquired. That wave of consolidation kicked off in 2020 and persisted, thanks to economic headwinds, well into 2023. Aurora, which was founded in 2017 by alumni of Tesla, Uber and Waymo, took the path to public markets in a bid to raise the capital needed to commercialize the frontier tech. Aurora became a publicly traded company in 2021 after merging with a special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson. Aurora has emerged as one of the last remaining companies focused on commercializing self-driving big rigs. Kodiak Robotics, which is privately held; Torc Robotics; and Swedens Einride are also working on self-driving trucks. Still, it hasnt always been the smoothest of roads, as the high cost of employing engineers to develop the technology combined with economic headwinds has chipped away at capital. In 2022, a leaked memo sent by Aurora CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson presented a swath of cost-cutting and cash-generating options to its board, ranging from a hiring freeze and spinning out assets to a small capital raise, going private and even selling itself to high-profile tech companies Apple and Microsoft. The company assured investors it had enough money to get to mid-2024, and while some cost reductions were made, real relief came in July 2023 when it completed a capital raise of $820 million from a public and concurrent private offering of its stock. The company said at the time that the stock sale would help fund it through commercial launch at the end of 2024 and \u201cwell into 2025. Aurora reiterated its financial position in its third-quarter 2023 earnings report and said it expects its total liquidity of $1.5 billion to support its planned commercial launch and fund operations into the second half of 2025."

        "Extracted Article": "Expense management startup Brex, which was valued at $12.3 billion two years ago, laid off 282 people, or about 20% of its staff today. The once high-flying fintech startup sent a note to employees (that was also published on the company\u2019s website) today, announcing the news. In addition, Brex announced that its COO, Michael Tannenbaum, is transitioning from his role to become a board member. Camilla Morais, who was SVP of global operations, is being promoted to COO. And Cosmin Nicolaescu is transitioning from his role as CTO to an adviser position this summer. In the note to employees, co-founder and co-CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote that the company was now \u201cemphasizing long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains\u201d in its comp structure. \u201cThe opportunity ahead of Brex is massive, and we want everyone staying to have high conviction and financial upside in our equity,\u201d he added. Franceschi also said the company is changing its operating model, expecting leaders to operate at all levels moving forward, promoting from within, increasing in-person collaboration in our hubs, and concentrating the time zones in which we operate. Not its first rodeo In October of 2022, Brex laid off 136 people, or 11% of its staff, across all departments as part of a restructuring. After those layoffs, Brex had just over 1,150 employees. It is not clear how many employees Brex has today, though its layoff indicates the figure at around 1,300 before its previous cuts. The latest layoff news comes amid a report from The Information that the company reportedly told employees that it burned $17 million a month in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that it only had \u201cenough cash to last through March 2026.\u201d A spokesperson for Brex told that publication on Monday that the company\u2019s cash runway is now four years. When asked about financials, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the data was \u201cinaccurate,\u201d directed me to the note announcing the layoffs and wrote: \u201cThe changes today are driven by a desire to make Brex more agile and accelerate our path to profitability, building on the growth we had in 2023. We grew our revenue 35%+ in 2023 while gross profit increased by 75%. This reduction in force puts us on a clear path towards profitability.\u201d She added: \u201cBrexs financial plan is to be well above cash flow positive with the current cash we have, which calls for around 4 years of runway. Plus, cherry picking certain months for financial burn is not the correct way to look at burn.\u201d Brex had a short-term boost to its business after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last year. But that growth has since slowed, largely due to the hike in interest rates and resulting slowdown in VC funding. With more startups failing and not growing, many of Brex\u2019s customers began spending less overall. The company\u2019s annualized net revenue was $279 million in the fourth quarter. While that was up 32%, most of that growth took place in the first quarter of the year. Employees affected by the restructuring will receive eight weeks of severance, with two additional weeks of pay for each additional year of service. The company is also offering a waiver of the one-year equity cliff for those who haven\u2019t reached theirs yet. Things at Brex have been up and down since June of 2022, when the company declared that it was \u201cless suited to meet the needs of smaller customers\u201d in an announcement that caused shock waves in the startup community. While&nbsp;Brex soon clarified that by smaller customers it meant small- to medium-sized businesses and non-funded startups, the move still felt like a stunning reversal, considering the company had started its life as a credit card company&nbsp;for startups. The announcement came about two months after Brex announced a&nbsp;\u201cbig push into software\u201d and that it was placing greater emphasis on moving upmarket to serve larger, enterprise customers. Last June, the company seemed to have an about-face, tapping Jason Mok, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) operating partner and more than 16-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank as its new head of startups. Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch at the time that \u201cfounders and startups have always been at the core of Brex.\u201d The spend management space has grown increasingly competitive with players such as Ramp, Navan, Mesh Payments and Airbase (among others) clamoring for market share. In December, Navan, an expense management startup once known as TripActions, laid off 5% of its staff, or 145 people. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here."

        "Extracted Article": "Yet another series of layoffs has hit Google, this time at its video-sharing platform, YouTube. The company will eliminate 100 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. Last week, Google laid off more than 1,000 workers across several divisions, including engineering, services and voice-activated product Google Assistant. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re responsibly investing in our companys biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a provided statement. \u201cTo best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, and to align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally.\u201d Initially reported by Tubefilter, Youtube\u2019s chief business officer, Mary Ellen Coe, wrote in an internal memo sent to staff on Wednesday afternoon that the job cuts were part of restructuring changes to its creator management and operations teams. The 100 affected employees apparently have a chance to apply for other positions at YouTube, yet this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a guaranteed position within the company. According to The New York Times, workers have 60 days to find new roles before their dismissals are officially in effect. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to support any impacted employees as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond,\u201d the spokesperson added. We\u2019re only three weeks into the new year and already have seen dozens of companies across the tech industry face job reductions, including Discord, Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios, as well as Audible, Duolingo, Instagram, Pixar and Unity, among others.

        "Extracted Article": "Artifact, the news aggregator-turned social network from Instagrams founders, is shutting down. On Friday, the startup announced via a blog post it had made the decision to wind down operations of the app launched over a year ago, saying that the market opportunity wasnt big enough to warrant continued investment. The team had rapidly iterated on its product from a SmartNews-like news reading app to a curation and news discovery platform where individual users could become creators of a sort, finding interesting gems from around the web that others could like and comment on. It also employed several AI tools to summarize news, rewrite clickbait headlines and surface the best content. However, the slate of changes had perhaps diluted the original value of the product, which was a simple news app that could take on the likes of built-in offerings on users phones, like Apple News. The end result was something more akin to a Twitter replacement but thats a market with numerous competitors, including, in fact, Metas Instagram, which has launched a Twitter/X rival called Threads. In the blog post, penned by Instagram and Artifact co-founder Kevin Systrom, he writes that acknowledging the market reality is something startups often fail to do, but making the tough call earlier is better for everyone involved. The biggest opportunity cost is time working on newer, bigger and better things that have the ability to reach many millions of people, Systrom writes. I am personally excited to continue building new things, though only time will tell what that might be. We live in an exciting time where artificial intelligence is changing just about everything we touch, and the opportunities for new ideas seem limitless, he said. To give users time to transition, the app will begin by shutting down various features, like the ability to comment and make posts. This will help reduce the moderation efforts. Existing posts will remain visible for the time being, and Artifact will continue to operate its core news capability through the end of February. The shutdown comes amid increased competition in the Twitter rival landscape but also a slowdown in the usage of other news aggregators, like SmartNews. The latter had a rough 2023, with layoffs and the replacement of its CEO, while its app has been losing downloads and active users. In part, the way users are finding news and information is changing with the arrival of AI. At the same time, publishers are finding their content has been wrapped up in AI training data, which is then queried by users of bots like OpenAI ChatGPT leading to lawsuits, in some cases, and licensing deals in others. For Artifact, it hadnt quite defined what it wanted to be a Twitter-esque conversation and discovery platform, a Pinterest rival for discovering interesting links or an AI-powered news engine. That may have led to a missed opportunity to capture users attention, as users didnt know how the app would fit into their usual workflows. Despite the shutdown, Systrom says that news and information remain critical areas for startup investment, and that he believes other bright minds are working on ideas in this area. The co-founder spoke about AIs role at Artifact at this past falls TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. A video of that talk is below. Artifact co-founder Mike Krieger says theres a flavor of Twitter in apps latest release Artifact takes on X and Threads with new Posts feature &nbsp;"

        "Extracted Article": "Treasure Financial has laid off 14 employees, the fintech startup confirmed to TechCrunch today. The layoffs took place in December. The move affected some 60% to 70% of the company, according to multiple sources familiar with internal operations. Sam Strasser, founder and CEO of Treasure Financial, told TechCrunch that \u201ca need to streamline our operations and align our workforce with our current strategic goals and financial realities\u201d drove the decision. \u201cMarket conditions and organizational challenges aside, financial stewardship necessitated this unfortunate but necessary action,\u201d he added. Strasser did not yet confirm what percentage of employees were laid off, but did say Treasure offered severance packages to affected workers, as well as extended health benefits, and is helping them find new employment opportunities through a partnership at HuntClub. San Francisco-based Treasure Financial offers cash management software for businesses and is a registered investment advisor (RIA). Just last July, the startup raised $7.5 million in a funding round led by Ventura Capital, a previous investor in the firm. Existing backer PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel also participated in the financing, along with other unnamed investors. It had previously raised $7 million in funding. Last August, RIAIntel reported that Treasure Financial had seen \u201cexplosive growth\u2026in the wake of 2023\u2019s banking crisis and the Fed\u2019s recent interest rate hikes.\u201d The publication also reported that Treasure had more than doubled the clients it served to about 300 since the beginning of the year, and that it had almost doubled its assets under management over the same period, to roughly $500 million.

        "Extracted Article": "Pitch, the company behind a collaborative presentation software for businesses, is scaling back and bootstrapping, with CEO and co-founder Christian Reber stepping down and two-thirds of its employees losing their jobs. This translates roughly to 80 personnel, based on the 120 headcount figure Pitch has published on its about page. Reber made the announcement in a social media post earlier today, confirming that the companys co-founder and CTO Adam Renklint will be stepping into the hot-seat with immediate effect, with Reber retaining a seat on the company board. Founded in 2018, Berlin-based Pitch arrived in private beta back in 2019 with $30 million in funding, led by the creators of an app called Wunderlist which Microsoft bought in 2015. Pitch had raised north of $130 million in funding from the likes of Lakestar, Index Ventures and Tiger Global Management, supported by a slew of high-profile angels, including the founders of Instagram and Zoom. Pitch in action Image Credits: Pitch As with just about every other VC-backed startup, Pitch has clearly faced challenging times in terms of maintaining growth and keeping their investors happy. As many of you know, being a venture-backed company in 2023 was insanely challenging, Reber wrote. We created sky-high expectations for our business, our employees, and ourselves as founders. Towards the end of last year, my co-founders and I noticed that those expectations were simply too high, and we decided that we wanted to take a new and completely different path for Pitch. Organic growth Reber said in the post that rather than trying to build a hyper-growth company built on venture funding, its going back to the drawing board and pursuing profitability and then organic growth. This involved working with its investors about resetting our company and cap table, according to Reber, who stopped short of explaining exactly what that means. However, TechCrunch confirmed with someone with knowledge of the situation that Pitch essentially returned all unspent cash to its investors pro rata, reducing the investors ownership stake in the process. This means that current and past employees (including all the founders) now own 80% of Pitch, while the company has enough cash to see it through a couple of years either to profitability, or to a point where it can sell at a lower price than its previous valuation (which was $600 million in 2021). Part of this plan, of course, involves reducing its headcount significantly. And while the year is still young, todays layoff news alongside other recent layoffs suggests that 2024 could be set to follow on from where 2023 left off. We know that a sustainable path has a much higher chance of success than the path we were on, Reber added. Going forward, we\u2019ll be a significantly smaller team focused on creating maximum value for our customers and driving sustainable growth. *This article was updated to include more detail on the nature of Pitchs cap table reset."

        "Extracted Article": "Here, a fractional short-term vacation rental marketplace, has shut down its investment platform after just over two years of operation. The Miami-based startup, which had raised a known $5 million in funding, posted on its website on January 3 that it was shutting down the platform \u201cdue to the current interest rate environment and economic conditions.\u201d Fiat Ventures led its $3.5 million seed round in July of 2022, according to Crunchbase. Other backers include Joe Montana\u2019s Liquid 2 Ventures, Mucker Capital, Bragiel Brothers, Alumni Ventures, Gaingels, and a number of fintech executives. In a statement on its website, the company said its goal was to sell all of the properties that it holds within the next six months. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals the company had reported a net loss of $56,374 from its properties for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Notably, it generated $276,233 in revenue during the same period. But Here also reported paying $166,305 in interest during the same time frame, and $58,920 in \u201cother expenses.\u201d In a written statement via email, a company spokesperson: Only Here\u2019s fractional investment platform shut down on January 3rd, 2024. Here\u2019s other business units will continue to operate as usual. The company did not specify what those business units are, or respond to a query as to whether or not it had laid off staff. Here was founded in July of 2021 but didn\u2019t launch operations until 2022. According to the publication ShortTermRentalz, the marketplace gave investors a way to acquire partial ownership of vacation rentals. Here handled the property management process, pledging that \u201cmembers could earn monthly income on their investment proposition and potential property appreciation.\u201d Here offered shares for as little as $1 as part of its self-described mission of providing a lower barrier to entry to invest in the vacation rental asset class. CEO and co-founder Corey Ashton Walters also co-founded Homeworthy, a remote cloud real estate brokerage. \u201cHere has made impressive strides to democratize access to vacation rental investments, an asset class historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy, said Marcos Fernandez, managing partner of Fiat Ventures, in a written statement. Although the company is winding down its fractional investment platform, it is alive and operational, committed to its mission and actively pursuing new avenues.\u201d Interest rates have surged over the past two years, contributing to a flurry of proptech startups to close up shop. Just last week, TechCrunch broke the news that Frontdesk, a short-term rental provider, had laid off its entire staff and was on the verge of shutting down. Last November, we reported on Zeus Living reportedly shutting down after raising $150 million in debt and equity.

        "Extracted Article": "Another proptech startup has run into trouble. Frontdesk, a startup that managed more than 1,000 furnished apartments across the United States, laid off its entire 200-person workforce Tuesday after attempts to raise more capital failed, TechCrunch exclusively learned from sources familiar with internal happenings at the company. The mass layoff comes just seven months after the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based startup acquired smaller rival Zencity. The layoffs, which included full-time, part-time workers and contractors, occurred Tuesday afternoon during \u201ca two-minute Google Meet call, according to one employee who was among those attending the virtual meeting. During that call, Frontdesk CEO Jesse DePinto told employees that Frontdesk would be filing for a state receivership, an alternative to bankruptcy, according to the sources. The company has not responded to a request for comment. When calling the number on Frontdesks website, a recording says: \u201cCurrently, Frontdesk is unavailable. If you have a reservation, please seek alternative accommodations and expect to be contacted within the next two weeks.\u201d TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. Frontdesk, which was founded in 2017, had raised about $26 million from investors such as JetBlue Ventures, Veritas Investments and Sand Hill Angels, according to Crunchbase. Frontdesk went out for a bridge round, attempting to sell investors on a new plan of doing full building management, sources told TechCrunch. That tactic didn\u2019t work out and the company couldn\u2019t keep operating. Frontdesk was apparently still optimistic about its ability to raise more capital; the startup had posted on LinkedIn openings for several jobs, including a chief of staff role, just two months ago. As a result of all the challenges, the company was not only not able to make rent on a number of properties but had little to no communication with the reportedly infuriated landlords, according to the sources. The startup\u2019s business model, which is leasing apartments at market rental rates and furnishing them for short-term rentals in more than 30 markets, has struggled largely due to the upfront costs involved, associated capital expenditures and variables in demand and rates, one of the sources said. Others in the space have also had challenges, including Stay Alfred, Domio, Lyric, Zeus Living, The Guild and WanderJaunt. Ironically, Frontdesk previously acquired over 100 units across several cities from WanderJaunt, Stay Alfred, Lyric and Domio."

        "Extracted Article": "Superpedestrian, the e-scooter startup known for its self-diagnostic software, is shutting down its U.S.-based shared scooter operation on December 31 and exploring a sale of its European business, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The companys director of U.S. operations, Alexander Berg, confirmed the news to his team Friday afternoon on a Zoom call. Berg said the reason for the shutdown was financial, but did not go into further detail. Even our investors have put in money to keep us afloat even to this point, he said on the call. It wasnt for lack of trying. The shutdown comes just 18 months since the startup raised $125 million in a Series C round of equity and debt financing that included investors Jefferies, Antara Capital, the Sony Innovation Fund by IGV and FM Capital alongside existing backers like Spark Capital, General Catalyst and Citi via the Citi Impact Fund. It appears Jeffries and Antara were two of the investors who helped try to keep the company afloat, as Superpedestrian assigned patents to each as collateral for loans of undisclosed amounts in July and October, respectively, according to documents filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The e-scooter industry has been in a somewhat rocky place since then, though. Birds valuation crashed after it went public, leading to the company pulling out of multiple markets. Superpedestrian itself has gone through a series of layoffs, including one just months after closing its Series C round. The latest, per a posting on LinkedIn, occurred earlier this month. On the call, Berg said Superpedestrian will run minimal staff while pulling scooters across the country back into warehouses over the next two weeks. Vanessa Carmack, Superpedestrians senior director of human resources for the U.S., who said she had been through layoffs at prior companies, told workers during the Zoom call that the experience was frustrating and said she felt kind of kept out of the loop. CEO Assaf Biderman held a short call with some employees earlier Friday initially announcing the decision. Biderman did not immediately respond to a voicemail and an emailed request for comment. Superpedestrian has said its scooters are in operation in 60-plus cities across 11 countries, though it pulled out of Chicago in September citing competitive difficulties. A representative from the city of Waco, Texas, where Superpedestrian recently spun up a scooter fleet, said in a phone call Friday that she was not aware of an impending shutdown. The startup used technology, and specifically diagnostic and safety software, to differentiate it from rivals like Bird and Tier. The company boosted its tech efforts by acquiring Navmatic in July 2021. It leveraged Navmatics technology to develop and then roll out a so-called pedestrian defense safety system, a feature designed to detect and correct unsafe riding behaviors, like riding on sidewalks, in real time. Superpedestrian had planned to build and roll out new scooters equipped with its branded Pedestrian Defense to 25 cities across the United States and Europe in 2022. The initial deployments were supposed to begin in the U.S. and the United Kingdom in pedestrian-dense cities by early spring, according to the company."

        "Extracted Article": "Cruise, the embattled GM self-driving car subsidiary, is laying off 900 employees, or about 24% of its workforce, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The layoffs are part of a plan to slash costs and attempt to revamp the company following an October 2 incident that left a pedestrian stuck under and then dragged by one of its robotaxis. An email, penned by newly minted president and CTO Mo Elshenawy, was sent this morning to the entire 3,800-person workforce. The email, which TechCrunch has viewed, began with a resigned tone: We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult\u2014especially for those whose jobs are affected, Elshenawy wrote. Workers were expected to be informed within the hour of receiving the company wide email as to whether they would be losing their job. GM, which acquired Cruise in 2016, was rewarded by shareholders for the cutbacks. GM shares rose 4.8% to $35.64 following the news. Cruise is targeting non-engineering jobs in the layoffs, particularly those people who worked in the field, commercial operations and corporate staffing, according to the email. The company has also ended additional assignments of contingent workers who supported its driverless operations. Engineering, a category that makes up the bulk of the Cruise workforce, is largely being preserved, according to the content of the email and discussions with internal sources. The email continued: Today, we are making staff reductions that will affect 24% of full-time Cruisers, through no fault of their own. We are simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale. As a result, we are reducing our employee counts in operations and other areas. These impacts are largely outside of engineering, although some Tech positions are impacted also. Workers will remain on the payroll through February 12 and will be eligible for an additional eight weeks of pay, with long-term employees offered an additional two weeks\u2019 pay per every year at Cruise over three years, according to the email to staff. Anyone laid off will also receive their 2023 bonus (eligible target payout) on January 5, 2024. Other parts of the severance package include health benefits through the end of May, two months contribution into their 401(k) plan and continued time on payroll through March 24 for immigrants in lieu of a lump-sum severance payment to allow visa holders additional time to help transition and manage their immigration status. The company also said that all employees, regardless of whether they were laid off, will receive their January 15th vesting through its employee share-selling program. Cruise issued a statement confirming the layoffs. \u201cWe shared the difficult news that we are reducing our workforce, primarily in commercial operations and related corporate functions, the emailed statement reads. These changes reflect our decision to focus on more deliberate commercialization plans with safety as our north star. We are supporting impacted Cruisers with strong severance and benefits packages and are grateful to the departing employees who played important roles in building Cruise and supporting our mission.\u201d The layoffs come just a day after nine senior leaders (SLT) at Cruise, who worked in its commercial operations, legal and policy departments, were dismissed by the companys board. COO Gil West and David Estrada, who was head of government affairs, were among that group. Elshenawy reiterated the company would be narrowing and refocusing its efforts, information shared last month following the resignation of co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt and some executive shuffling that included appointing Craig Glidden, GM\u2019s EVP of legal and policy and a Cruise board member, as chief administrative officer at Cruise. Jon McNeill, a member of GM\u2019s board, was also named vice chairman of the Cruise board. McNeill, who joined the Cruise board recently and was previously chief operating officer at Lyft and president of Tesla, now serves alongside GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra. Cruise executives said at the time they wanted to take a measured business approach that preserves cash and improves safety culture in an attempt to put GM\u2019s troubled autonomous vehicle subsidiary on the right path. The first steps in that rebuilding plan, which included pausing production on its Origin robotaxi, were laid out in an internal email sent to employees in late November by Elshenawy, who was executive vice president of engineering at Cruise and ascended into the president role after co-founder and CEO Vogt resigned. Elshenawy repeated that intent in the Thursday morning email stating that the company was simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale. Cruise used all-electric Chevy Bolt vehicles, which have been specifically manufactured to support its self-driving system, in its robotaxi fleet. The company intended to shift toward a custom-built autonomous vehicle called the Origin. The layoffs have been largely expected at Cruise for weeks now. Last month. Barra reiterated plans for Cruise to be more \u201cdeliberate\u201d when operations eventually resume at the troubled self-driving vehicle subsidiary. For GM, that includes slashing spending at Cruise \u201cby hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in 2024, an action that most expected would result in widespread layoffs. GM and the Cruise board have been scrambling ever since the October 2 incident put the company in the crosshairs of state, local and federal agencies. However, Cruises robotaxi operations in San Francisco had been criticized by the public and city officials almost immediately after the California Public Utilities Commission issued the company in August the final permit required to operate commercially. Videos of Cruise robotaxis blocking traffic and driving into a construction site were shared on social media. But it was a crash with an emergency response vehicle that began to chip away at the companys seemingly impenetrable exterior. This story is developing ."

The Bengaluru-headquartered startup which also identified PayU, Quona, Zip, Omidyar Network and Ribbit Capital among its backers employed about 150 people and had raised over $130 million in its eight-year journey. The startups new leadership, which informed the employees about the decision to shut down Tuesday, didnt respond to a request for comment. The startup will fully wind down by the end of the month, the leadership said. Moneycontrol first reported the development. The move follows ZestMoney founders quitting the startup in May this year after acquisition talks with fintech giant PhonePe didnt materialize. The founding team handed over the firm to three new leaders, who raised a few million dollars from existing investors and attempted to find a new path for the company. They engaged with many investors and fintech giants in recent months to explore deals, people familiar with the matter said. ZestMoney, once valued at $445 million, was among a handful of Indian startups that used alternative data points to help build credit profiles on consumers, making them eligible to make their first online purchases. India\u2019s low credit card penetration has left a majority of the population without traditional credit scores, which banks rely on to evaluate creditworthiness before issuing loans. Furthermore, small loans do not yield significant returns for banks, disincentivizing them from issuing such financial products. In response, ZestMoney, alongside other emerging startups like Axio and LazyPay, has attempted to carve out a niche in a market traditionally dominated by financial giant Bajaj Finance. Tuesdays news is the second blow for Omidyar Network this week. Omidyar-backed Doubtnut which had raised over $50 million and once received a $150 million acquisition deal agreed to sell for $10 million, TechCrunch reported Monday."

        "Extracted Article": "Its a tough day for Dataminr, the New York-based big data unicorn last valued at $4.1 billion. TechCrunch has learned that the company which uses AI and big data algorithms to provide predictive insights about news and other global events, is laying off about 20% of staff today, or around 150 people. It cites the impact of the economic environment, operational efficiencies, and the recent rapid advancements of our AI platform, according to a memo from founder and CEO Ted Bailey, shared with us by a source. In the company-wide memo that we have seen, staff were told to work from home today while they waited for details on whether they would be part of the impacted group of employees. The company had been signaling to staff since October that a restructuring was coming, although its not clear what business areas are being affected, nor what the state of the companys business has been like recently. Bailey noted in the memo that the restructuring measures will put Dataminr on a very strong financial footing moving forward. The company will be looking to further progress its AI platform and products specifically with the launch of a new AI platform in Q1 that will combine predictive AI with generative AI but even with the investment that those will require, as a result of the moves its making today, Dataminr will have multiple years of cash runway and a near-term path to profitability, he continued. (That potentially also implies that its setting itself up for a scenario in which it wont be raising more outside funding.) We have reached out to Bailey, the companys media relations team and various other individuals to confirm the details provided to us by a source (who, unfortunately, appears to be among those impacted: really sorry again, friend). One of those individuals, who asked not to be named, also confirmed the details. In the meantime, there are now posts on LinkedIn from others hearing the news through the grapevine and looking to hire. And just as we were about to hit publish on this, a spokesperson from the company confirmed the memo to us. Dataminr, founded in 2009, first came to prominence at a time when we were seeing the emergence of companies using clever big data techniques to parse unstructured data from social media posts and combining it with structured and unstructured data from other sources to understand public sentiment and other insights. Dataminr took that concept and applied it squarely to insights about global events and other news. Users equipped with mobile phones used platforms like Twitter as an outlet to post about something they were seeing; Dataminr tapped into this, combined it with other data sources, and was able to pick up a development right as it was happening, often ahead of the rest of the world jumping on the news. Unsurprisingly, some of the data it gathered and how it got used has courted controversy over the years. But that didnt appear to stop the company from gaining traction. Dataminr found success with key partnerships with companies like Twitter, and customers in government, enterprise, financial services and media. And in the heady funding days of the 2010 decade, it raised money a lot of it. It was last valued at $4.1 billion when it raised $475 million in 2021. Overall, it has raised more than $1 billion, with its 100+ investors including the likes of Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, as well as Venrock, IVP and many more. (Twitter, now called X, was once also an investor, although it divested its stake some time ago.) PitchBook data indicates that it raised an undisclosed sum in further funding in two different tranches in the last year. Dataminr has always had a large number of subject experts that it had on staff alongside engineers and sales and customer success specialists. In more recent years, and most likely this year, the company has really doubled down on the AI aspect of its tech stack, one reason why it might see a route forward downsizing its workforce without impacting business."

        "Extracted Article": "German micromobility operator Tier Mobility is laying off another 22% of its workforce to cut costs in the never-ending grind toward profitability, according to a LinkedIn post from CEO Lawrence Leuschner. The hits keep coming for the micromobility giant, which sailed into 2022 on a high note. By March 2022, Tier had raised a $200 million Series D from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Mubadala Capital, and had acquired docked e-bike share company Nextbike, Wind Mobilitys Italian unit and Fantasmo, a startup building camera-based scooter parking validation technology. The micromobility giant also acquired Spin from Ford, a move designed to help the company break into the North American market. Come August 2022, Tier would issue its first major round of layoffs, cutting 180 staff members amid a poor funding climate. Five months later, Tier laid off 100 people across the Tier and Spin brands. In May, Tier raised a convertible note to keep it running while it searched for a buyer, after acquisition talks with Bolt and Lime reportedly fell through. In September, Tier sold off Spin to Bird, another struggling micromobility company, for $19 million. Todays layoffs come as Tier reckons with what many startups and scale-ups have learned in the past year growth and expansion is out, profitability is in. That means reducing operational losses, which can be caused by redundancies in the workforce. In his post, Leuschner said Tier has been working tirelessly to get to profitability. The company improved EBITDA from -62% in 2022 to be on track for -15% in 2023. He also said he expects Tier to be profitable on an annual basis for 2023 in 80% of its markets, including Germany, the U.K. and France. Leuschner also said its e-bikes unit has been able to achieve profitability in 2023. Despite some wins, Leuschner said Tier hasnt made it to profitability yet, which means theres still more we need to do and decisions we need to make for 2024. With not enough visibility on how and if markets will recover, we have to presume demand in 24 will look like demand in 23, he wrote. This means that to get to profitability, we need to bring our cost base down. The layoffs today affect around 140 employees. Tier did not respond in time to say which teams will be most affected by the layoffs, only saying the job cuts would be to the companys central and regional workforce, with the majority of affected roles sitting centrally. Tier has already said goodbye to a large handful of top staffers this year, including the companys co-founder and chief technology officer Matthias Laug, who left in February, citing personal reasons. Others have also left in the last six months, including Tiers head of engineering, VP of finance, SVP of corporate strategy and develop and VP of product and growth."

This decision comes as part of a streamlining effort, particularly in markets where the company had previously hired technical roles to support its primary operations in Africa. Paystack reduced its workforce by 33 employees, as highlighted by co-founder and CEO Shola Akinlade in a tweet on Thursday. Following its acquisition by U.S.-based fintech Stripe, Paystack expanded its geographical presence by establishing offices in Accra, Cape Town, Dubai and Nairobi. This expansion was complemented by recruiting staff in Europe through remote operations and establishing an engineering hub in Dubai. Paystack had already maintained offices in Lagos and San Francisco prior to these developments. Today was a difficult day at Paystack. We\u2019re reducing our operations outside of Africa, and will be parting ways with up to 33 employees in Europe and the UAE.

The company, characterized by its lean operation, has experienced a moderate expansion in staff strength, contributing to a series of product releases over the past three years. Notable developments include introducing an app for Shopify, launching a terminal device and, most recently, adding a direct debit feature. Paystack has also developed integrations with global software and payment solutions, with notable examples being ApplePay. The company is undergoing private beta testing in Ivory Coast, Egypt and Rwanda as part of its strategic expansion efforts. Nigerian businesses can now accept Apple Pay on Paystack Yet, despite the progress on these fronts, the Stripe subsidiary, which has over 150 employees per LinkedIn, acknowledges it\u2019s time to change strategy. Stripe itself had laid off 14% of its team last year and a few dozen this June. \u201cWe\u2019re changing our operating model to prioritize locating team members within the markets we serve, to localize costs and get closer to customers,\u201d Akinlade said. The chief executive noted that those affected will receive a severance package that includes four months\u2019 salary, accelerated equity vesting and health insurance extended by three months. \u201cThese are some of the most talented people I\u2019ve ever worked with, and my goal is to ensure that every single one finds new roles as soon as possible. I\u2019m personally happy to vouch for each one and do reference calls as needed,\u201d he added in the tweet while leaving a form for parties interested in hiring the affected Paystack employees, whose roles cut across software engineering, legal and compliance, finance, sales and marketing, product design and human resources.

        "Extracted Article": "Chewy, the online pet supplies company that sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion, but then split off a few years later, is the latest company to undergo layoffs, TechCrunch has learned. According to multiple sources, the pet supplier has laid off more than 200 employees a figure Chewy confirmed including those in its Plantation, Florida headquarters, and other sites. The company is dually headquartered in both Florida and Boston, with offices in Minneapolis and Bellevue, as well. Chewy confirmed the layoffs took place across multiple locations and said the number of people impacted was north of 200. According to various sources, we understand that the impacted roles spanned HR, recruiting, data and business intelligence, and even included some directors and higher managers, including a vice president. Chewy didnt confirm the job roles it eliminated, but there is talk of the headcount reductions on discussion forums like Blind, where users are reporting Chewy reduced its headcount by 220 people, and noted the reductions included some engineers, developers, product managers and supply chain personnel. The company is said to be providing a minimum of one months severance with additional weeks based on tenure, these users said. Chewy confirmed the layoffs in a statement. As we head into 2024, we took the opportunity to consolidate some of our headcount and align our efforts into priorities which we believe will gain us the most significant customer wins and generate the highest business returns, to enable us to strengthen the company\u2019s future, said Chewy spokesperson, Diane Pelkey. This was a difficult decision that was carefully considered as part of our overall strategy and ongoing focus on becoming an ever more agile and disciplined company. We are grateful to our team members for their contributions and remain committed to supporting them during this transition, she added. Though Chewy reported a surprise profit of 4 cents per share in its most recent quarter on revenue of $2.78 billion, analysts were concerned over the declining active users of the e-commerce site, which fell from 20.49 million in the year-ago quarter to 20.39 million. Chewy CEO Sumit Singh had also expressed concerns over how inflation was impacting its business, creating more cautious consumers who were now buying lower-priced items, like dry dog food, instead of wet food, and were pulling back on buying pet treats. Coming out of the summer months, we are sensing a shift in consumer mindset toward being more discernible and, at the same time, with a higher willingness to consolidate their share of wallet to their trusted retailer of choice, Singh said on a call with investors. This behavior is driven by a more fluid macro environment, including high levels of inflation, which have been passed through the industry over the past 18 months. Our dialog with our suppliers confirms that these trends are permeating throughout the pet industry, he noted. Chewy was earlier acquired by BC Partners, which also bought PetSmart for $8.7 billion in March 2015. Chewy went public in 2019 and BC Partners later split up PetSmart and Chewy, but remained a large shareholder in Chewys business. BC partners sold a minority stake in PetSmart to Apollo earlier this year. (Disclosure: Apollo owns Yahoo, TechCrunchs parent company.) Also earlier in 2023, an advocacy group asked the Department of Labor to investigate BC Partners boards over concerns about overlapping directors as some directors sat on both the PetSmart and Chewy boards, despite the split. A low-flying pet supplies company just sold to PetSmart in the biggest e-commerce sale ever"

        "Extracted Article": "The grip Twitter, now called X, has on the market may be stronger than some believed. Unfortunately, thats led to the first casualty among Twitter alternatives, as the startup Pebble (formerly T2), is shutting down. The would-be X rival had grown a small but engaged community on its microblogging service that aimed to dupe Twitters features, from its verification systems to functionality like DMs. But the company says theyve run out of time to make Pebble happen the app maxed out at 3,000 daily active users, out of 20,000 registered users. That daily user figure fell to 1,000 daily users following its rebranding from T2. In part, the sizable competition coming from other Twitter rivals was to blame, says co-founder and CEO Gabor Cselle, who had exits to Google and Twitter prior to starting Pebble. I think the competitive landscape evolved faster than we had thought, he explains. I didnt think that quite as many people established organizations and newcomers would try to do the same thing that we were doing and in very similar ways. Today, the market for Twitter alternatives is a crowded one, to say the least. There are numerous services for consumers to try, including the open source-based platform Mastodon, a soon-to-be decentralized system from Bluesky, plus smaller startups like Spill, Spoutible and Post, as well as a new app from Meta called Instagram Threads. Then, of course, theres the X factor to consider. The default platform for short posts retains some pull, despite or perhaps because of new owner Elon Musks antics. Though the company may not have yet succeeded from a business and financial perspective, its been hard for others to duplicate its function as a breaking news platform and place for spirited debates. I think Threads and others have encountered this as well, adds Pebble co-founder and CTO Michael Greer, previously Discord engineering head. The durability of the network effect of Twitter is stronger than anticipated, he says. Image Credits: Pebble Despite these challenges, Pebble initially had decent retention. By week four, it was seeing retention rates of 30%, in fact. Its invite list was also working, as 60% of people who received a Pebble invite converted to become users. In addition, some 10,000 users arrived at that list from early press, like TechCrunchs coverage of its first outside funding a $1.1 million angel round that included investors like former Google VP Bradley Horowitz, Android co-founder Rich Miner and the former CEO of Wikipedia, Katherine Maher. Data from Similarweb indicates the Pebble website topped 99,300 visits last month, indicating repeat usage. The companys hypothesis was that consumers were hungry for a Twitter alternative that prioritized trust, safety and moderation from the start. To that end, Pebbles founding team included co-founder Sarah Oh, Twitter\u2019s former human rights advisor. Pebble continues to believe its approach to moderation was correct, even if it was not ultimately a factor in driving growth. We came in with a particular angle: kinder, safer. Trust and safety. And I think our approach to moderation that we did have on the site did work, says Cselle, adding that Pebble didnt have some of the issues other federated platforms faced. For example, TechCrunch reported that Bluesky earlier this year had strained its relationship with Black users, as it failed to crack down on bigotry on the site. Later, users on Bluesky were even creating usernames with racial slurs, and yet the platform didnt issue a public apology. Pebble never faced any such controversies. But it may have positioned itself a little too far into the kindness territory, the founders now believe. We were really seized by people saying they wanted something that felt safer, where they could speak openly without dogpiling, says Oh. And so we were confident that was an important thing to hit. Are there other things that are equally important and a great user experience? Yes. Twitter is you have real peoplesaying real things, Oh continues. At the expense of using a word thats overused, authentic. And our theory was always if you can create a space where people really feel like they can let down their hair, then you would get that authentic content. We didnt quite get there, she admits. Cselle agrees, noting that, perhaps, Pebble should have opened up enough space for disagreement to happen, while still drawing a hard line on the most disagreeable parts of running a Twitter-like platform. I think we could have maybe moved a little bit further towards that, he says. Theres a lot of nice things that are said on Pebble, but maybe not enough breaking news. Not enough conversation. There were other things that may have hurt Pebbles traction, too, including its lack of a native mobile app. As T2, the startup prioritized building for the web to be agile and more flexible, but lost out on the opportunities for discovery driven by the app stores. Notes Greer, that might have been a mistake. In retrospect, Cselle also questions if the rebranding from T2 to Pebble may have been an issue. Im wondering if the Pebble rebrand had actually softened the value prop[position] because T2 just encapsulated it so much that it was really duplicative [of Twitter], he says. Image Credits: Pebble Like most startup shutdowns, the answer as to why is not any one thing but a combination of factors. For Pebble, thats certainly true. It was a perfect storm of competition, Xs continued traction, the lack of a native app, a brand that didnt resonate and a space that was maybe a little too safe to be as addictive and as fun as the original. With Pebbles winddown, being announced to users today at 9 AM PT, early adopters will have the option of exporting their Pebble archive as a zip file that loads a mini web page showcasing all their old posts. Pebble wont be directing users back to X however, or any other social network. Image Credits: Pebble screenshot As for where the founders will now hang out? I dont know. Maybe LinkedIn, Cselle jokes. Pebble is also returning a small amount of the funds left over to its investors, more as a courtesy to show financial responsibility. The Pebble website will be shut down on November 1st and there arent further plans for the IP at this time. The founders dont regret their experience building Pebble, even though it didnt turn out as they hoped, they said. Says Cselle, One thing that I learned is that theres absolutely an audience that wants to see a new kind of Twitter-like platform built and will ask for the features that Twitter has. He suspects the team might stay together to work on something new after Pebble wraps, taking the learnings from Pebble with them. That includes better communicating to users what great content should look like on a platform, and how they can win. Were at an inflection point in social media, says Oh. We had one hypothesis with T2 and Pebble. It obviously didnt pan out the way that we wanted it to. But I think well look back and see this past year is a really important turning point for the role that social media plays in our lives, she adds."

        "Extracted Article": "Roblox China was once full of promise. Since its localized platform, which is a joint effort with Tencent, abruptly halted operation nearly two years ago, the company has been quiet about its standing in the worlds second-biggest gaming market. Until now. TechCrunch has exclusively learned that Roblox China, also called LuoBu (\u7f57\u5e03\u4e50\u601d), initiated a round of layoffs in October. A spokesperson for Roblox confirmed to TechCrunch that 15 roles, which comprised a small number of Roblox Chinas teams in the U.S. and its headquarters in Shenzhen, were affected. The decision was made after an evaluation of the operational structure in support of LuoBu, said the spokesperson. Those employees whose roles were impacted have been informed. These actions are specific to LuoBu and its unique business and operational needs. No other teams within LuoBu or at Roblox are impacted. Roblox gave no further information on which roles were cut. Roblox Chinas headcount is in the range of 100-499 according to its listing on Boss Zhipin, a major recruiting site in China. The new layoffs arrived not long after Robloxs significant reduction in its talent acquisition team, which marked the children-oriented gaming giants shift of focus from expansion to its bottom line. TechCrunch has also reached out to Tencent, which runs the LuoBu joint venture with Roblox, for comment on the layoff. In 2019, Tencent and Roblox established a joint venture in China in which Roblox would hold a 51% controlling stake, a rare instance where the foreign entity was granted the majority share. The goal was to build a localized version of Robloxs gaming platform, which is known for its user-programmed games, while Tencent would provide the necessary gaming license for its foreign partner to operate in China. The challenge of running any platform that thrives on user-generated content in China is to ensure the content is in line with Beijings censorship rules and cross-border data regulations. Those stipulations can be nebulous and cumbersome. So when LuoBuLeSi, the Chinese version of Roblox, suddenly paused service in December 2021, its well-informed users werent all that surprised. Roblox was candid about its unique challenge in China at the time: We always knew that building a compelling platform in China is an iterative process, and we are thankful for the support of LuoBuLeSi users and our global developer community. There is no sign that Roblox is giving up on its China dream. Commenting on the new layoff, its spokesperson said: We remain committed to our long-term vision and plan for the LuoBu platform in China. Roblox isnt the only one facing hurdles in the Chinese gaming market. Blizzard Activision, the California-based gaming publisher behind World of Warcraft and Overwatch, began to roll back operations in China in January after its 14-year license with its local partner NetEase expired. At the time, the gaming giant said it would be looking for a new publishing partner. Roblox pauses service in China as it takes important transitory actions"

Transphobia is rife within the healthcare industry; its one reason why transgender patients struggle to access basic care. Legal barriers are also on the rise. In the U.S. alone, state lawmakers have introduced close to 150 bills this year to restrict trans healthcare. The need to expand access to life-saving, gender-affirming therapy was apparent when Plume launched four years ago, just as its clear today, particularly for folks in rural areas. So its disconcerting to see telehealth company Plume, a rarity in the startup world for its focus on serving marginalized people, quietly lay off around one sixth of its workers. About a year ago, the startup raised a $24 million Series B. A spokesperson confirmed in an email to TechCrunch that Plume laid off a portion of its staff. The spokesperson said the layoffs were part of a decision to accelerate the build out of its fee-for-service business, which will make gender affirming care more accessible and affordable to the majority of the trans community. According to Plume, laid-off employees received severance and a range of support services. Plume said it isnt pulling back its offerings. Today, the startups website promotes a monthly membership for trans folks seeking hormone therapy, as well as a one-time fee for letters of support requested by insurers and surgeons. Down the line, it seems like Plume will expand to offer other services for a one-time fee. One TechCrunch source, who left Plume earlier this year, said they heard about the layoffs from former colleagues. The writing was on the wall this summer, the source said. They definitely squeezed people out early by creating a pretty toxic work environment for myself and other trans folks, the source added. It was all a really disappointing experience. In response, a spokesperson said the company strives to be a thriving, supportive workplace and we celebrate diversity. They added that a co-founder of Plume is trans, and approximately 70 percent of the team is trans or gender diverse, and reflective of the members we serve. Plume co-founder Jerrica Kirkley said in August that the startup has worked with 13,000 patients across 45 states since 2019. Its only been about a year since Plumes Series B. However, many companies a bit further down the VC funding path \u2014 middle-aged ones, as reporter Joanna Glasner puts it \u2014 are struggling to access funds. Its considerably tougher this year than it was last year to secure Series C rounds in particular. The slowdown is driving many late-stage startups to cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, according to a Q3 PitchBook-NVCA report.

Though it marketed itself as a one-stop shop to beautify bathrooms it offered potential customers a variety of templates, then promised to pair them with in-house project managers, help with required permits, assign them contractors, order the required materials and offer updates and virtual assistance until every renovation was complete people increasingly complained to the company, on social media and to this editor, that what Made Renovation was really providing was broken promises, long delays and cost overruns. One customer told TechCrunch that a general contractor assigned to her project by Made refused to demolish her old bathroom, dismantling only the top half. Another shared that Made disbanded its project management team without alerting him and spun the cost-cutting development as a positive for customers. It subsequently sent him a downloadable \u201cSelf-Management Construction Support Guidebook.\u201d Meanwhile, over at HomeAdvisor, a digital marketplace that connects service professionals with customers, Made Renovation received half a star out of five across seven reviews listed. Made Renovation is \u201c[w]here dreams of great-looking bathroom remodeling and belief in seamless project management go to die,\u201d wrote one reviewer. \u201cAbsolute nightmare of an experience!\u201d wrote another. The founder and then CEO of Made Renovation, Roger Dickey, didnt respond to our requests for comment at the time. Now, two months later, the company, which had raised at least $31 million across two rounds of fundings, has let its shareholders know that it is closing the business and selling off certain assets of the company to an unnamed acquirer as quickly as possible. (Maybe before the acquirer changes its mind?) Richard Couch, the chairman and CEO of a turnaround firm, Diablo Management Group, authored the note, saying that his firm is actively unwinding the company and that, while Made still exists, he has been appointed its CEO and sole director. What that means for Mades customers isnt clear. We have reached out to Couch for more information. Meanwhile, the Walnut Creek, California, number listed in his letter to shareholders prompts an error message, saying that calls to the number cannot be completed as dialed. Heres the letter that was sent out this past Saturday: October 15, 2023 To All MADE Shareholders: This correspondence is to inform you that, effective October 10th, 2023, MADE Renovations [MADE, the Company] announced that it had received a formal Letter of Intent from a potential acquiror who seeks to purchase certain assets of the Company as quickly as possible. Following this sale, the company intends to close the business, release all employees, and settle all affairs of the Company to the extent that resources and circumstances will allow. Effective on the same date, the MADE Board of Directors engaged the services of Diablo Management Group [DMG], a nationally recognized turnaround and consulting firm, for the purpose of managing the companys sale of assets and business closure. I, Richard G. Couch, Chairman and CEO of DMG, have been appointed as CEO and the sole Director of MADE. With this action, all Officers of the Company have been released and all members of the Board have resigned, except Mr. Couch. Although we are in active negotiations and planning with a potential purchaser, we cannot predict a successful outcome nor make any estimate of value at this time. Should this transaction not be completed, we will proceed with business cessation. We are in the process of determining the total assets and liabilities of the Company. While this process is underway, cash resources have sufficiently diminished such that we have suspended payments on any past due obligations of the Company. We will provide updates on our progress as soon as possible.

While we are adapting our organizational structures and streamlining our decision making, we are continuing to invest in strategic priorities for our future and to ensure we continue to deliver value for our members and customers, the company said in an unsigned statement today. We are committed to providing our full support to all impacted employees during this transition and ensuring that they are treated with care and respect. It didnt specify which strategic priorities but a refocus on hiring more AI talent is likely part of the mix. After getting acquired by Microsoft for more than $26 billion in 2016, LinkedIn became significantly less transparent in terms of its finances and other operational metrics. In Microsofts July 2023 full-fiscal-year earnings report, the company noted that it had more than 950 million members and over $15 billion in revenues, with Talent Solutions the single biggest contributor at $7 billion+. We continue to use AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform. Our AI-powered collaborative articles are now the fastest-growing traffic driver to LinkedIn, it said at the time. More to come."

        "Extracted Article": "Braid, a four-year-old startup that aimed to make shared wallets more mainstream among consumers, has shut down. Founded in January 2019 by Amanda Peyton and Todd Berman (who left in 2020), San Francisco-based Braid set out to offer friends and family an FDIC-insured, multi-user account that was designed to make it easy \u201cto pool, manage and spend money together.\u201d Users could create a cash pool toward a collective goal of, say, saving for a trip to Europe and then spend it on airfare or lodging using a branded debit card. Braid raised a total of $10 million in funding \u201cover multiple rounds\u201d from Index Ventures, Accel and others, according to Peyton\u2019s LinkedIn page. In a blog post, Peyton said that Braid closed its doors in September and outlined her experiences in building the company, ultimately realizing that it wasn\u2019t going to be a viable business venture. In the post, Peyton took responsibility for Braids demise, but stressed her belief that it was important to share her story of what happened. \u201cI have no regrets, Peyton said in an interview with TechCrunch. We did it the right way: Every customer dollar was cashed out; every employee was treated with care. There is magic in failure too, if you squint a bit. We were given the opportunity to take a big swing and it\u2019s important to recognize how rarely that happens in life. She added of the shutdown: It was terrible, it totally sucksBut its part of the life cycle. I think its just part of what you sign up for. And its part of why we do thisI did YC in 2010 and that is one of those things that sticks with you forever. Part of their whole thing is there just needs to be more startups we just need to do more. There needs to be more than more people starting startups. There needs to be more opportunitiesBut [failure] its this part of that cycle. And I think its the part that people dont talk about a lot, but its just as important as the seed round or the launch. Also in her blog post, Peyton described the struggles that Braid faced after having issues with a sponsor bank that led to the company \u201ceffectively [being] in a coma from July 2022 to January 2023.\u201d Without a sponsor bank, the company was in limbo. It was bleak we were a payments company processing $0 in payment volume, she wrote. Despite finding a new sponsor bank, Braid continued to struggle. One of the biggest takeaways from her experience, Peyton said, was that leveraging third-party software would not necessarily help the company move faster and focus on its core offering. She wrote: \u201cWhat we found, instead, was every additional partner had the potential to break big, important parts of our stack. Building a multiplayer offering meant we had to be as close to the metal as possible, because a lot of our UX didn\u2019t really exist off-the-shelf. After several painful migrations, our distaste for contractual and technical lock-in grew dramatically. By the end, if there was something we could build ourselves in Retool, we did. In addition, building mostly in-house was the only way our unit economics worked. There\u2019s a lot of great fintech software out there, but if that software eats your entire margin, you\u2019ll end up dead regardless.\u201d Looking ahead, Peyton noted that she, post shutdown, purchased the intellectual property for Braid in an auction. I Iove fintech, she told TechCrunch. I love payments. I think theres enormous, humongous opportunity here. Prior to co-founding Braid, Peyton worked at Google and Etsy. She also started another company called Grand St., a marketplace for creative and indie technology products that was acquired by Etsy in April of 2014 for an undisclosed amount. Peyton also started another e-commerce company that wasnt venture-backed, as well as a mobile messaging company that went through a YC cohort and that the founder noted also failed.

        "Extracted Article": "Product Hunt, the product discovery site for smaller startups, apps, tech tools and developers side projects, is cleaning house. The company earlier this month announced layoffs, but didnt give an indication of how widespread those cuts were. We now understand the cuts impacted around 60% of the team, including design, product, sales and other roles. Product Hunts about page indicates engineering, ads and community staff remain. The layoffs were first publicly announced on October 10, when CEO Rajiv Ayyangar posted on X in an effort to help connect former employees with hiring opportunities. He wrote: This week I did a round of layoffs at Product Hunt across multiple functions. We had to narrow the roles on our team for speed and focus. Were parting ways with talented individuals who care deeply about their work and teammates. If youre hiring, dm me I\u2019d love to connect you. This week I did a round of layoffs at Product Hunt across multiple functions. We had to narrow the roles on our team for speed and focus. Were parting ways with talented individuals who care deeply about their work and teammates. If youre hiring, dm me I\u2019d love to connect you\u2026 &mdash; Rajiv Ayyangar (@rajivayyangar) October 10, 2023 The size of the layoff was first leaked by longtime Product Hunt user, Chris Messina, an open source advocate and tech veteran turned investor. Messina, who is still active on the site, has hunted 3,690 products over the years more than any other Product Hunt user, allowing him a close connection to the company and its team. On Threads, he wrote that Product Hunt had cut 70% of staff, but the CEO tells us that figure was a little high. Image Credits: Chris Messina on Threads (opens in a new window) It was actually around 60% of the team, Ayyangar explained. Our About page was a little out of date, he noted. Ayyangar, a former Product Hunt user himself, had only just joined the company in September after prior roles as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Dropbox and CEO and co-founder of virtual office startup Tandem. In his introduction to the Product Hunt community, the new exec hinted that changes were ahead for the product discovery platform. He suggested that while the site remained the best place to discover your next favorite product before they went mainstream (wed argue that place is TechCrunch, of course), the company admittedly had not done a great job of helping people find the best product for their needs, despite the wealth of contributions weve collected from our community, he wrote. In addition, Ayyangar suggested that the site needed to leverage new technology, like AI, as well as moderation and other tooling to get better at spotlighting whats new in tech. And while it would still continue to exist as a launch platform, it was also adding other features that took it beyond the launch, like Pro Tips product pages that would serve as a wiki for favorite products, he said. Ayyanger tells TechCrunch the layoffs were not due to economic factors. It wasnt for financial or company performance reasons, he said. Traffic has never been higher and were in a great place, financially. It was for strategic reasons. The laid-off staff did receive severance, he also noted. Its an interesting time for Product Hunt to redefine itself, given the explosion in AI advances that make single-purpose, smaller tools that developers would tinker around with in their spare time less of an interest. Businesses, meanwhile, are looking to cut costs during the economic downturn, which means reducing SaaS (software-as-a-service) spending by 10% to 30%, as TechCrunch recently reported. That begs the question as to how many companies would be willing to experiment with new SaaS products, like those theyd discover on Product Hunt or elsewhere. Originally a YC and a16z-backed startup, Product Hunt was acquired by AngelList for $20 million in 2016, spun out in 2020, and in 2021 inspired a new fund, Hyper, which would exist as a sister company for the site. The program included an exclusive Product Hunt launch event and investor demo day. Hypers program has now been sunset and it isnt running any new batches, Ayyangar confirmed to TechCrunch. However, the team will continue to support the companies already in its portfolio, he said. &nbsp; Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com or (415) 234-3994 on Signal."

Brave eliminated some positions as part of our cost management in this challenging economic environment. Several departments were affected, amounting to 9% of our staff, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement. The company has been taking steps to bolster its revenue sources this year. In April, Brave Search ditched Bings index to start relying on its own indexing solution. In May, the company released its own search API for clients, with plans starting from $3 per 1,000 queries. The API also offers different plans for AI data model training, data with storage rights, spellcheck, and autosuggest. Last month, Brave introduced image, news, and video results as part of its Search API. Brave has also been testing a native AI assistant called Leo for its browser. While it plans to make it available to all users, Brave said that Leo will have a premium tier with features like higher rate limits and access to more conversation models.

        "Extracted Article": "Arrival just warned investors that its slashing its workforce yet again. The electric van maker said on Tuesday that it took actions on October 5 to further reduce costs. Those actions include letting go of up to approximately 25% of its workers, the company stated in a letter to investors. Arrival last announced layoffs in January, when it said it would cut its workforce by 50% to around 800 employees. The firm didnt respond on Tuesday when TechCrunch asked for the number of employees it intends to lay off this time. EV company Arrival to cut workforce by 50% in third restructuring effort Arrival has had its hands in everything from developing electric vans and buses to cars for ride-hailing drivers, but it has yet to announce any commercial vehicle launches. South Carolina approved Arrival for a $500,000 grant and job development credits in 2020, a spokesperson for the states Commerce Department told TechCrunch. The spokesperson said the state intended for the grant to offset costs related to building improvements in connection with Arrival\u2019s first U.S. electric vehicle micro factory in Rock Hill. The company must meet certain job and investment commitments by December 3, 2025, or else itll be required to repay a pro rata portion of the grant funds disbursed, the spokesperson added. Arrival went public in 2021 by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Its since restructured several times and pivoted its focus away from the U.K. market to the U.S. It did so, at least in part, to take advantage of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for commercial vehicle purchases. Arrivals current status is a bit of an open question; the company hasnt shared a quarterly update since publishing its first-quarter results in the middle of May. The firm also recently scaled back its North American headquarters about 30 miles north of Rock Hill \u2014 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Corrected Oct 11 to reflect that Arrival received job development credits in 2020, not 2022."

        "Extracted Article": "Bird, the shared micromobility company that was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange last week, is issuing another round of layoffs, according to an email interim CEO Michael Washinushi sent to the company. TechCrunch has viewed the email. TechCrunch has been unable to confirm the number of people affected by the layoffs. Bird has yet to respond to our questions for clarification, but we will update this story once they do. The reduction in headcount comes two weeks after Bird acquired Spin, another shared e-scooter operator based in the U.S. At the time, Bird said the geographic overlap between the two companies was minimal. Spin operates in more than 50 cities and university campuses across the country. with any acquisition and integration process, there are redundancies in roles and scope that the business isnt able to maintain while meeting its goals, wrote Washinushi. Regrettably, today we need to reduce our headcount in order to achieve our broader goals and to ensure that the entire organization can sustain itself and continue its mission Washinushi continued to say that Bird needs to create the most efficient integrated team possible, which involves cutting certain members of staff. Impacted employees received a calendar invite for a meeting with a senior leader in their department on the day Washinushi sent the email. The email details next steps, including opportunities for teams to discuss the events and an all-hands town hall meeting to talk about the layoffs and learn more about how the Spin integration will play out. Bird has struggled to reach profitability since going public via a special purpose acquisition merger in November 2021. At the time, Birds implied valuation was $2.3 billion, but the companys stock price began plummeting soon after its debut. And as Birds balance sheets became part of the public sphere detailing rampant cash burn without the revenue to back it up investors continued to lose confidence. Bird isnt uniquely bad at succeeding in the scooter business. Despite the hype that inflated the companys valuation, deploying shared vehicles is actually tough to get right due to the businesss high-cost, low-return nature. However, Bird didnt do itself any favors by following a growth-at-all-costs spending model. The company also moved to an asset-light business model that relies on a fleet manager program run by independent contractors to deploy scooters. This has led to less control over the placement of vehicles, which can affect revenue. Bird also delayed rolling out scooters with swappable batteries, which likely added to its cost of operations and decreased asset utilization. The companys missteps caught up with it in the summer of 2022, when Bird had to lay off 23% of staff and shut down its retail scooter product in an effort to rein in costs and work toward profits. In September of the same year, Shane Torchiana took over as CEO, replacing Birds founder Travis VanderZanden. Torchiana, who subsequently left the company in August 2023, implemented a strategy of severe cost cuts, which included leaving dozens of unprofitable markets across the U.S., as well as Sweden, Norway and Germany. His strategy also involved increasing fleet utilization by incentivizing fleet managers to rebalance more efficiently, rather than just putting scooters where the managers thought theyd get more rides. Birds second-quarter earnings 2023 show that that strategy didnt really pan out. Average rides per vehicle per day were down 19% year-over-year. In November 2022, Bird issued a going concern warning, claiming it might not have enough funds to continue operations. That warning has remained in effect until present day. In the end, Bird was delisted after failing to maintain a market capitalization above $15 million for 30 consecutive days. Can Birds Spin acquisition give it the lift it needs?"

        "Extracted Article": "IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director and funded by cyber and defense investors, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. In a regulatory filing published Friday, IronNets president and chief financial officer Cameron Pforr said the company had ceased all business activities as it prepares for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, effectively liquidating the companys remaining assets to pay its remaining debts. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander, soon after he departed as the former director of the National Security Agency during the biggest leak (at the time) of government secrets by former contractor Edward Snowden. IronNet provided corporations and government agencies with technologies aimed at helping to defend against cyber threats, and using large datasets and analytics to automate threat intelligence. Its other products were designed to protect critical infrastructure. To date, the company raised more than $400 million in funding, including a $78 million Series B in 2018 led by C5 Capital, with participation from ForgePoint Capital and Kleiner Perkins, and touted customers like media and financial giant Thomson Reuters. IronNet also received $5.6 million in federal loans granted to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the company failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021 and its stock price continued to decline following an initial spike. By the following year, IronNet had fewer than 100 corporate customers. IronNet also cut 17% of its workforce this June. Alexander served as IronNet CEO until July, when he was replaced by Linda Zecher, the chairperson of IronNets largest investor C5 Capital as part of the investment firms effort to rescue the company. C5 Capital, which did not return a request for comment, injected more than $1.3 million into IronNet last month to stave off its eventual collapse. Investors at Forgepoint Capital and Kleiner Perkins did not return TechCrunchs requests for comment about IronNets bankruptcy. In its Friday filing, IronNet said it expects that no distributions would be available for stockholders. Alexander, who remains chair of IronNets board, also serves on the board of SolCyber.

        "Extracted Article": "Epic Games is laying off 16% of its employees, impacting about 870 people, the Fortnite maker announced on Thursday. The company also announced that its divesting Bandcamp, an online audio distribution platform it acquired last year, and spinning off most of SuperAwesome, a kid-safe technology developer that it acquired in 2020. The layoffs news was first reported by Bloomberg. For a while now, weve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in a memo to employees. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic. Sweeney went on to note that the company had been making ongoing efforts to reduce costs, including moving to net zero hiring and cutting operating spend on things like marketing and events. Despite these efforts, the company ended up far short of financial sustainability and Epic concluded that layoffs were the next logical step. Sweeney says that conducting the layoffs now and on this scale will stabilize the companys finances. As for Bandcamp and SuperAwesome, Bandcamp is joining Songtradr, a music marketplace company, while SuperAwesome\u2019s advertising business will now be spun out as an independent company under the SuperAwesome brand, led by its current CEO Kate O\u2019Loughlin. Were cutting costs without breaking development or our core lines of businesses so we can continue to focus on our ambitious plans, Sweeney wrote. About two-thirds of the layoffs were in teams outside of core development. Some of our products and initiatives will land on schedule, and some may not ship when planned because they are under-resourced for the time being. We\u2019re ok with the schedule tradeoff if it means holding on to our ability to achieve our goals, get to the other side of profitability and become a leading metaverse company. The company says its focused on shipping its most successful initiatives, which includes the next Fortnite Season and Fortnite Chapter 5, Del Mar, Sparks and Juno. Epic says its release schedules for these projects remain unchanged. The news comes as Epic announced today that Fortnite V-Bucks will increase in price in the United States and several other countries on October 27. In the blog post, the company explained that the price increase of around 12% to 15% per bundle is due to economic factors such as inflation and currency fluctuations. The layoffs also come as Epic filed a cert petition with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking the court to reexamine a 2021 ruling over Apple\u2019s App Store policies. If the Supreme Court decides to hear the case, it would reopen a legal battle between Epic and Apple that began back in August 2020. In todays newsroom post, Epic notes that its been taking steps to reduce our legal expenses, but are continuing the fight against Apple and Google distribution monopolies and taxes, so the metaverse can thrive and bring opportunity to Epic and all other developers. Epic asks the Supreme Court to weigh in on its beef with Apple"

        "Extracted Article": "Talkdesk, a company once valued at $10 billion that sells software to help large corporations improve customer service, has laid off more employees \u2014 the third round of cuts in less than 14 months. A Talkdesk spokesperson confirmed Tuesday via email that it had made \u201climited headcount reductions in a few areas.\u201d She declined to share how many people were affected by the latest round of cuts. The 12-year-old San Francisco-based company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer service for midmarket and enterprise businesses. At the time of its last raise, it counted more than 1,800 companies as customers, including IBM, Acxiom, Trivago and Fujitsu. The company has made several cuts in the past 14 months in an effort to cut costs on lower revenue projections, according to one source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Talkdesk reportedly laid off staff in February of this year and in August 2022, when it had about 2,100 employees. It\u2019s unclear as to how many workers remain. CEO Tiago Paiva said in an emailed statement that the limited cuts would not negatively affect the company. \u201cInvestments and advancements we\u2019ve made in AI position us at the forefront of CX innovation, enabling a leaner, more agile global organization, Paiva said. The limited headcount reductions we made in a few areas will not negatively impact our speed of innovation. We will continue to invest in and hire in strategic areas that allow us to innovate faster and more efficiently, at scale. As one example, we are evolving our location strategy. With our recent FedRAMP In Process designation, and success in healthcare and regulated industries, we are increasing R&amp;D investments in the U.S. Our business remains strong, and we have a tremendous market opportunity ahead of us.\u201d Talkdesk raised $230 million in Series D funding in August 2021, which more than tripled its valuation to $10 billion. Update on September 27: An affected employee confirmed that at least 140 people, if not more, were impacted by the latest round of layoffs many of whom are located in Portugal. Portuguese publication Observador reported that: Employees are being proposed to sign a termination by mutual agreement \u2014 which, in the eyes of the law, would not be a dismissal and, consequently, would not guarantee access to unemployment benefit. The proposal will have been presented this Monday and a deadline will have been set until this Friday, September 29th, to communicate the decision to the company."

        "Extracted Article": "Roblox, the community-focused gaming platform popular amongst kids, has downsized a substantial portion of its talent acquisition team, signaling a shift in the companys focus from expansion to the bottom line. In a statement to TechCrunch, Roblox confirmed that about 30 employees in its talent acquisition organization were let go on Monday. No other teams are impacted. The aggressive growth targets Roblox was operating against in the past few years required a heavier investment in our TA organization, said a Roblox spokesperson. With our commitment to getting our cash compensation growth in line with our bookings growth by the end of Q1 2024, we now need a smaller Talent Acquisition organization to meet our adjusted hiring needs. This action is the result of the reduction in our hiring targets to better align with our growth goals. There were hints that the hiring slowdown was on the cards as part of its ongoing effort to cut costs. As Robloxs chief financial officer, Michael Guthrie shared on the firms recent Q2 earnings call: We will see leverage against pretty much all of the cost areas over the next 12 months. We think well see a little bit of leverage in cost of goods sold because weve slowed down hiring, leverage against our compensation expenses because infra, trust and safety, we slowed down a little bit there. Weve already closed the gap pretty meaningfully on both of those two. The company has undergone a period of rosy growth in the last few years, nearly tripling its daily active users from Q1 2020 to 66 million early this year. As its business balloons, its spending more on compensating developers. Developer exchange fees, which comprise the sum Roblox pays to creators who cash out the in-game currencies earned, amounted to $348 million in the first six months ended June 2023, compared to $290 million a year before. Despite growth in user numbers and hours spent on the platform, users arent spending more. Average bookings per DAU from the second quarter was $11.92, down 3% year-over-year. Roblox remains unprofitable, posting a net loss of $282.8 million in Q2 2023, up from $176.4 million the previous year. Robloxs operation in China, a joint venture it set up with Tencent in 2019, appears unaffected by this round of layoffs. Former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar joins Robloxs board"

        "Extracted Article": "Divvy Homes, the rent-to-own startup that gained attention and investment from Tiger Global and other high-profile investors, is laying off 94 employees. The layoffs \u2014 its third round in the past year \u2014 represents the latest blow to the real estate tech company, as mortgage interest rates have continued to surge. The 94 employees are spread across the United States, with some based in the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters as well as remote employees in other locations such as Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Texas and Washington, according to a September 7 letter that Divvy Homes head of talent Rachel Ergmann sent to Oregon\u2019s Office of Workforce Investments. The job cuts affect people working in a wide range of roles, including the vice presidents of sales, compliance, people and comms/PR, as well as a senior recruiter, a number of software engineers and account executives. The terminations will take effect as of November 7. Its not known how many employees remain at the company. A source familiar with internal happenings at Divvy said the most recent round of layoffs made up almost half the company. Doing the math, that means it likely had just under 200 employees prior to the cuts. TechCrunch reached out to Divvy Homes for additional details but had not heard back at the time of writing. The source added: The layoffs were attributed to the macroeconomic climate, the current cost of capital, and the need to conserve cash. The economics of the company dont work when interest rates are this high, and its likely the company wont be close to fully operational until interest rates go down. Divvy laid off in February an unknown number of people, including the company\u2019s head of growth marketing, according to real estate publication Inman. That followed a September 2022 layoff of about 40 people, or some 12% of its workforce at the time, as reported by Inman. Innovative model gone wrong? In its heyday, Divvy Homes claimed to be different from other real estate tech companies because it worked with renters who wanted to become homeowners by buying the home they wanted and renting it back to them for three years \u201cwhile [they build] the savings needed to own it themselves.\u201d The once-buzzy startup has raised more than $700 million in debt and equity from well-known investors such as Tiger Global Management, GGV Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), among others. Divvys last known funding occurred in August 2021 a $200 million Series D funding led by Tiger Global Management and Caffeinated Capital at a $2 billion valuation. The Series D round was announced just six months after a $110 million Series C. Divvy Homes last known valuation was $2.3 billion in 2021, according to PitchBook. Mortgage rates dropped to historic lows in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. But since March 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on a mission to curb inflation, interest rates have soared. According to The Mortgage Reports, \u201cmortgage rates entered August below 7%, but by the end of the month, they had soared to 7.23%, a level not seen in over two decades, according to Freddie Mac\u2019s records.\u201d By last week, they had jumped even higher with the average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages climbing to 7.42%, according to Bankrate. For companies like Divvy Homes, which purchased homes as part of its business model, the rise has been devastating limiting its ability to purchase homes and make money off those buys. The company also made headlines in October 2022 when Fast Company analyzed rents advertised by Divvy and determined that the company charged higher rents than other landlords in some markets, had ramped up evictions of clients and \u201ccould be slow to make repairs,\u201d as reported by Inman. The New York Times conducted its own investigation, finding that the company\u2019s model \u201cstuck renters with higher-than-average monthly bills.\u201d Divvy is one of many real estate tech, or proptech, companies that have struggled in the face of surging interest rates. Online mortgage lender Better.com has laid off thousands of workers since December of 2021 and recently experienced a dismal debut on the public markets.

        "Extracted Article": "Sensor Tower, a prominent market intelligence firm for the app economy, this week laid off a notable portion of its workforce, estimated at around 40 people out of the 270+ at the company, according to LinkedIns headcount. The layoffs included C-suite executives, TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources, including the CMO, CFO and more. Other teams impacted include finance and nearly all of marketing, were hearing. The company held an all-hands meeting to address the changes, which may still be underway as part of a larger reorg of Sensor Towers corporate structure. Sensor Tower confirmed the layoffs, but not the particulars, noting it would issue a fuller release next week. Earlier this week, Sensor Tower\u2019s management team took necessary steps to reorganize and right-size our business under a talented and experienced senior leadership team, said Melissa Sheer, a publicist for Sensor Tower, in an emailed statement provided to TechCrunch. We are excited about these changes as we position the company for a balance of continued growth and best-in-class profitability. We will provide more details in the coming days, she said. A popular provider of third-party data and insights for app developers, brands, marketers and publishers, Sensor Tower has grown its headcount over the years following its $45 million investment in 2020 from Riverwood Capital. The firm at the time cited 350 enterprise-level customers, such as Morgan Stanley, Zynga and Tencent. But Sensor Tower was still a small team then just 75 employees only a bit larger than the number of employees laid off this week. Sensor Tower grew again in 2021 with its acquisition of market intelligence company Pathmatics, which allowed it to offer an expanded set of digital and mobile advertising insights. The deal included an undisclosed growth investment from Riverwood Capital into Pathmatics. The company had then claimed it chose to raise more funds to further grow its business with investments in hiring, marketing and infrastructure, but noted it had been profitable since its launch. Today, Sensor Towers website touts its use by top brands, firms and marketers, like Dyson, LOr\u00e9al, Target, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Welchs, Petco, Chanel, Revolut, Getir, Warner Bros., Hershey, Wieden + Kennedy, ByteDance, Activision Blizzard, Allstate, Apple, Purina, Pepsico, Nike and more. Its data is regularly cited by top publications, including The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, CNBC, The New York Times, Bloomberg and others, including TechCrunch. Unfortunately, 2023 has been a tough year for layoffs, which have ranged from big names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, Zoom, Roku, Spotify and Shopify, to smaller startups across all sectors, including crypto, SaaS, enterprise, consumer and more. Update, 11/22/23, 3:30PM ET: Sensor Tower tells us the CPO was not impacted by the layoffs. We have removed the reference.

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity giant Malwarebytes this week laid off 100 employees as it prepares for a major restructuring that will see the business split into two, TechCrunch has learned. The layoffs come almost exactly a year after Malwarebytes eliminated 14% of its global workforce. A former employee who asked not to be named told TechCrunch that the layoffs come just weeks after the company\u2019s chief product officer, chief information officer and chief technology officer were let go. An archived version of the Malwarebytes leadership page shows that these positions no longer exist at the company. Multiple posts on LinkedIn showed that a number of additional employees were laid off this week. One former Malwarebytes employee described the layoffs as \u201can unfortunate annual tradition.\u201d Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski confirmed to TechCrunch that approximately 100 to 110 employees were let go this week, with the layoffs affecting predominantly corporate employees. Kleczynski also confirmed the company had made leadership changes as part of the \u201cstrategic reorganization.\u201d Kleczynski said the layoffs were part of a plan to separate the company into two separate business units, but denied that it planned to sell any part of the business. The split \u2014 which was not previously made public \u2014 will see Malwarebytes separate its consumer and corporate-facing business units. The consumer business will focus on tools such as identity protection and VPN, while the remaining business will focus on enterprise-facing software like managed and endpoint detection, Kleczynski tells TechCrunch. Full details of the split have not yet been finalized but will be announced in the coming weeks. Kleczynski tells TechCrunch that the latest round layoffs, which affected Malwarebytes employees globally, were an exercise in rationalizing expenditures. Kleczynski said Malwarebytes continues to be \u201chealthy and profitable.\u201d \u201cA profitable business is a viable business.\u201d Kleczynski said. Malwarebytes isn\u2019t the only cybersecurity company to make layoffs in recent months. Earlier this month, SecureWorks announced plans to let go of 15% of its workforce in order to deliver \u201cprofitable growth,\u201d and Rapid7 also confirmed it was laying off 18% of its global workforce, affecting more than 400 employees. https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/tech-industry-layoffs-2023/"

        "Extracted Article": "Sendy, a Kenyan logistics startup that enabled retailers to purchase FMCGs directly from manufacturers, among other services, is shutting down its operations and exploring a sale of its assets, TechCrunch has learned. Meshack Alloys, Sendy co-founder, confirmed the sale to TechCrunch without offering more details, saying: \u201cWe are in the middle of an acquisition process. So yes, Sendy is being acquired. We will issue a formal joint statement in two weeks or so time. In the meantime, we are unable to comment on further details at this time.\u201d According to several sources, the company ran out of funds two months ago and had been scrambling to cut costs for the past year to remain afloat. Last July, it announced a 10% cut of its workforce, which Alloys noted was in response to the \u201ccurrent realities impacting tech companies globally.\u201d Since then, however, Sendy\u2019s workforce has been pruned further in more cost-cutting measures (shuttering a product line and exiting a market). Last October, the Kenyan startup laid off 54 employees and wound down its supply service and this February, it exited its end-to-end fulfillment offering in Nigeria, a market it entered two years ago. Sendy\u2019s struggles marked the latest setback for a crop of B2B e-commerce companies that enjoyed a fine run, raising millions of dollars and ballooning in value, but have since run into operational costs and marginal customer pricing problems. The startup had targeted to raise $100 million last year but only got a fraction of the funding from MOL PLUS, the corporate venture capital of Japanese transport company Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. Since the deal, Sendy has been exploring other options to shore up its business these past few months, including seeking fresh capital and a buyer, three people familiar with the matter said. But that hasn\u2019t come easy. The Kenyan startup, valued at over $80 million late last year, was in talks with several investors to raise additional capital a few months back but at a lower valuation of $40 million to $60 million. However, one of its key investors backed out of the transaction, leaving Sendy short on funds for the last two to three months, including funds to cover salaries it is now attempting to sell some of its assets, the people said. Kenyan logistics startup Sendy raises $20M round backed by Toyota Furthermore, the pool of potential buyers is small. According to people familiar with the company\u2019s dealings, Sendy is in talks with other African companies in the B2B e-commerce and trucking space, including Trella, Sabi, Wasoko, and one of its investors, to sell some of its assets, including tech and fulfillment operations. It\u2019s unclear if any of the talks have resulted in a deal, and discussions on various options could still be ongoing, including an acquisition, as claimed by the startup. Over 200 employees are set to be affected by the closure. Sendy was co-founded in 2015 by Alloys, Evanson Biwott, Don Okoth and Malaika Judd. It has raised $26.5 million in disclosed funding from several investors, including Toyota Tsusho, Atlantica Ventures, VestedWorld, Keppel Capital, Enza Capital, AAICA Investment Pte Ltd, Sunu Capital and Goodwill Investments."

        "Extracted Article": "Astra has laid off 25% of its workforce since the beginning of the quarter and is reallocating at least 50 engineers and manufacturing staff away from its launch business to focus on spacecraft production, the company said Friday. The reallocation and layoffs are expected to delay testing of the under-development Rocket 4 and Launch System 2.0, Astra said. The affected employees worked in the company\u2019s launch, sales and administration and \u201cshared services\u201d departments. Workforce reductions are expected to save the company more than $4 million per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Astra, which is facing dwindling cash reserves, is no doubt looking for a way to further reduce operating expenses while also bolstering its spacecraft engine business, the only business unit that currently has a near-term chance of generating revenue. The spacecraft engine technology is sourced from Astra\u2019s acquisition of propulsion developer Apollo Fusion, which closed the day Astra went public in July 2021. Indeed, Astra said that it had closed 278 committed orders of the Astra Spacecraft Engine product through the end of March, which totals around $77 million in contracts once the engines are delivered. A \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of these orders will be delivered through the end of 2024, the company said. \u201cWe are intensely focused on delivering on our commitments to our customers, which includes ensuring we have sufficient resources and an adequate financial runway to execute on our near-term opportunities,\u201d Chris Kemp, CEO and founder, said in a statement. Astra also said that it had engaged investment bank PJT Partners as a financial advisor as it looks for more capital to continue operations. That includes \u201cpotential strategic investments in the Astra Spacecraft Engine business to strengthen Astra\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the company said. Separately, Astra said it had raised $10.8 million in a debt sale to investment group High Trail Capital. According to preliminary second-quarter financial results, Astra is expected to have revenues between $0.5-$1 million, while having just $26-$26.5 million in cash on hand. This is not the first time major layoffs have hit the space company. Last November, Astra announced it had let go of 16% of its employees, also to focus on launch and spacecraft engines."

        "Extracted Article": "ClickUp, the software-as-a-service startup that offers a workforce productivity platform and counts storied investors Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global among its backers, has laid off 10% of its workforce. With a total headcount of about 900 employees, it represents approximately 90 people. The company says it looks to become more efficient and be better positioned for a public listing amid the ongoing slowdown in the market. The San Diego-based startup notified some of its affected employees about layoffs last Thursday, TechCrunch learned and later confirmed through an email. Other employees impacted by the job-cut decision will transition out over the next few months. People affected included those from the software engineering division as well as customer service and support teams. We made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our workforce, primarily to move a portion of our support roles to lower-cost regions, said Zeb Evans, founder and CEO of ClickUp, in a statement to TechCrunch. This realignment enables us to be a best-in-class IPO-ready company in efficiency while continuing to overachieve in growth. Impacted employees will receive a severance package lasting 12 weeks, six months of insurance coverage and six months of access to the startups employee assistance program. In addition, the startup has allowed the laid-off employees to retain their laptops and equipment and has extended support to those on a visa. In 2022, ClickUp laid off 7% of its staff as a part of its restructuring. At the time, as reported by Protocol, a ClickUp spokesperson described the move as a one-time decision to stay on track toward profitability. ClickUp names Booking.com, IBM, Spotify, T-Mobile and Netflix among its customers. It provides a unified platform for document collaboration, project management, spreadsheets and chat. The startup also recently followed in big tech companies footsteps and introduced its AI-based assisting solution. Founded by Zeb Evans and Alex Yurkowski in 2017, ClickUp raised $400 million in a Series C funding round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global at a post-money valuation of $4 billion. The startup also includes Lightspeed Venture Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, Craft Ventures and Georgian Partners among its investors. We are very grateful for the contributions of the employees who have been impacted and are committed to supporting them throughout this transition. At the same time, we will continue to hire for roles aligned with our mission, especially those geared towards product and revenue, the CEO said."

Todays move comes as the company started to close operations of its automotive business unit Olx Autos in some markets after long exploring potential buyers and investors, TechCrunch learned and as confirmed by the company. The Amsterdam-headquartered company, which is operating in over 30 countries around the world, recently started informing the affected employees about the layoffs. They are not limited to a particular market or division, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. An Olx spokesperson confirmed the job cuts to TechCrunch and said it resulted from the decision to exit Olx Autos that was announced in March. Earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to exit the Olx Autos business and potential buyers or investors have been explored since then, the company said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. As a result of this process, it became clear that pursuing individual country sales was the best option, given the significant value that exists within local markets. This includes Chile, the financing business in Latin America, and both the Olx classifieds platforms and the Autos transaction businesses in India, Indonesia and Turkey. But Olx Group couldnt find potential buyers or investors in other markets, meaning that the company has shut down its operations in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. Although Olx Autos will continue to sell vehicles in these markets, the company will not be accepting any new transactions, as stated on the Olx Argentina website. As for other markets, its unclear whats going to happen next. We are committed to supporting all impacted people throughout this transition, the company said. Olx did not confirm whether the move impacted any C-level officers. It also did not immediately respond to a query about its headcount following the latest round of layoffs. In its annual report for the year ending on March 31, 2022, Prosus said its classifieds business \u2014 predominantly Olx \u2014 had 11,375 employees globally. The new job cuts notably come just months after Olx confirmed plans to decrease its global workforce by 15% (1,500 jobs) in January. In November, Prosus reported that Olx Autos saw 84% growth in revenue, reaching a significant milestone of $1 billion during the first half of its 2022 financial year. However, the automotive business has not yet achieved profitability."

Tada has not yet said how many staff it will lay off since its part of a voluntary early retirement program, a spokesperson at VCNC said, adding that it will be able to announce more concrete details in the not-too-distant future. Tada is said to cut at least 50% of its staff, or about 45 people, per local media outlets. Socar and Viva Republica, which operates Korean financial super app Toss, own Tada. This news comes almost 10 months after Socars IPO in 2022 and the recent breakdown of merger talks between Viva Republica and Jinmobility, a Korean ride-hailing company that operates i.M. Back in 2021, Viva Republica acquired a 60% stake in Tada for an undisclosed amount with an ambition to integrate it with its payment service. Viva Republica reportedly continues to have discussions with potential strategic partners for Tada to stay in business after merger talks with Jinmobility fell apart. The Korean fintech firm is looking for a variety of routes for Tada, the spokesperson told TechCrunch without providing further details. Viva Republica declined to comment. In South Korea, Kakaos car-hailing unit, Kakao Mobility, has the largest market share, with more than 90% in 2021, according to Koreas Fair Trade Commission. UT Taxi, a joint venture company backed by Uber Technologies and TMap Mobility, is another player in the car-hailing space in the country."

        "Extracted Article": "TrueCar, a platform where people can research new and used car prices and find local dealer savings, is laying off 24% of staff due to a restructure, the company said Wednesday. About 102 people will be impacted by the layoff. President and CEO Michael Darrow is stepping aside both from his executive roles to be replaced by Jantoon Reigersman and his position on the board. Reigersman previously served as TrueCars chief operating officer and chief financial officer. TrueCars stock jumped nearly 13% in after-hours trading on the news. The restructuring announced today better aligns our cost structure with our revenue base and is designed to make TrueCar a nimbler, more efficient company, said Barbara Carbone, incoming chair of the board, in a statement. We made this difficult decision after an extensive review and believe that it is necessary to enable TrueCar to achieve its strategic priorities and create long-term shareholder value. TrueCar says the restructure should result in nonrecurring cash payments of about $7 million, which will show up in the second and third quarters of 2023, and an annualized reduction in expensive exclusive of stock-based compensation of over $20 million. As of May 31, 2023, TrueCar had cash and cash equivalents of $146.5 million. The company expects that number to drop below $125 million in the near term, but says it continues to anticipate break-even or positive adjusted EBITDA and double digit year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. TrueCars first-quarter earnings also show a dip in revenue and increase in cost. The company closed Q1 with nearly $37 million, down from $43.5 million in the same period last year. Net loss hit $19.5 million, up from $12.4 in Q1 2022. TrueCar was founded in 2005 with a goal of revolutionizing the car-buying process by making it more transparent and efficient. The company officially launched at TechCrunch50 back in 2008, a now-ended pitch competition during which judges found TrueCars commitment to providing users with the actual price paid for specific vehicles in a given area compelling. TrueCar ran up against challenges in 2012 as dealerships were threatened by the companys model, even facing legal issues in states like California due to allegations of operating as a dealer without a license. The company continued to expand regardless, acquiring new businesses along the way, and went public in 2014 under the ticker TRUE. TrueCar was also sued by the California New Car Dealers Association in 2015 for allegedly violating California law with its billing model. TrueCar settled in 2017 and agreed to modify its billing model in the state. Carvana crashes back down to earth"

We regret to inform you that Tiki will be shutting down its operations. As of 11.59 PM India time, June 27, 2023, all Tiki functions and services will cease, wrote Tiki in a post. The demise of Tiki, which featured original and local-focused videos, comes as a surprise, as it maintained some 35 million monthly active users in India, its only operational market, according to data from Sensor Tower (shared by an industry executive). The Singapore-headquartered Tiki launched in India immediately after New Delhi banned TikTok. It remains a mystery how the video app, which was owned by an entity called Dol Technologies, was bankrolled. Many industry executives told TechCrunch that they believed that the firm was a loose subsidiary of one of the Chinese video apps that got nuked by New Delhi in mid-2020. The recent challenges faced by the tech industry have led to the closure of numerous startups, a post on Tikis social media accounts said. Despite being a small startup operating in Singapore and India, Tiki has always stood for being a place for real talents, said the post, signed by Team Tiki. The end of Tiki comes at a time when Indias short video market is seeing rapid consolidation and exits. Times Internet sold MX Players short video business to ShareChat last year, whereas Xiaomi shut its short video offering Zili earlier this month in the country."

Ursa Major did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s inquiry into the layoffs, or the number of people affected. According to LinkedIn, 292 people are listed as currently working at Ursa Major.

Among those laid off include engineers working in propulsion, the companys bread-and-butter, and quality analysis. Ursa Major is a Berthoud, Colorado-based startup developing liquid engines for rocket and hypersonic applications. The company is developing a 5,000-pound thrust Hadley engine and a 50,000-pound thrust engine called Ripley. Just recently, the company announced an \u201ceight-figure\u201d contract to further the development of two new engines: a Draper engine for hypersonic and a 200,000-pound thrust Arroway engine. In April, the company also announced that it would supply the upper-stage engine for Astra Space\u2019s in-development Rocket 4.

        "Extracted Article": "Taxfix leaped to a $1 billion valuation in 2022 on the back of a popular mobile app used by consumers to help with tax returns. But fast-forward to 2023, and the Berlin-based accounting startup is taking an audit of its own affairs. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Taxfix has laid off 20% of its staff 120 employees as part of wider restructuring of the business aimed at cutting costs. The cuts were announced to staff on Tuesday. Pointedly, they are coming in the wake of Taxfix acquiring a rival tax startup in the country, Stuttgart-based tax chatbot Steuerbot a deal that was announced two months ago. With Taxfix\u2019s recent successful acquisition of Steuerbot, great synergies are created, which enable us to heavily increase efficiencies. Therefore we took the strategic decision to restructure the organization, a Taxfix spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Taxfix originally said it would operate Steuerbot as an independent and complementary subsidiary. Taxfix had also been actively recruiting just prior to todays news; now it no longer lists open positions at the company on its own careers page so it appears that hiring is also frozen. The sudden changes underscore the pressure that startups are under in the current market. The most promising of them will have raised big rounds in years past at top valuations to stay in so-called growth mode intentionally remaining unprofitable and investing capital in their market and technology expansion. But now, with the funding landscape dried up, many of the same startups are being expected to pursue a variety of other courses: conserve the cash they have, cut costs where they can, be prepared to take hits on their valuations if they do need to raise (especially if theyre not tightening their belts), and aim for profitability all boxes that Taxfix is now aiming to check. The macroeconomic funding environment has changed over the past months, and it is, therefore, more important than ever to position ourselves as an independent company for the long term. This entails an even stronger focus of the business activities on sustainable growth and profitability, the spokesperson said. Taxfix did not comment on its current runway, nor whether it is currently trying to raise more money. The last funding the startup raised was just over a year ago, in April 2022, when it closed a $220 million Series D at a valuation of over $1 billion, from an impressive group of investors that included Teachers\u2019 Venture Growth of Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Board, Index Ventures, Valar Ventures, Creandum and Redalpine. In more heady times, you might have expected Taxfix to follow the route of other high-flying unicorns: By now it would have scooped up yet more investors and capital at an even higher valuation to break into more markets and accounting categories. But these days, sounds like theres a lot riding on just keeping things operating steadily on its own steam."

The announcement comes months after NY Magazine published an explosive feature on the neobank. The article honed in on Daylight, whose seed and Series A fundraises TechCrunch had covered here and here, respectively. NY Mags piece detailed a lawsuit brought on by three former employees as well as alleged fabrications and inappropriate behavior on the part of Curtis. In a blog published today, Curtis said he felt like \u201cnow is the right time to exit this market\u201d and told customers that their \u201cmoney is safe and will be fully accessible for transfer through 30 June.\u201d He added: \u201cDaylight had a great run paving the way for US LGBTQ+ customers \u2014 we opened thousands of trans-inclusive debit accounts, supported thousands of prospective LGBTQ+ parents\u2019 plans for their families. Ultimately, though, we couldn\u2019t provide these services in a way that covered our costs \u2014 this is likely a job for big banks and I hope they pick up the torch and carry forward our legacy.\u201d Founded in 2020, Daylight raised a total of $20 million in funding. Anthemis Group led its $15 million Series A in 2022. Other backers include Kapor Capital, Precursor Capital, Clocktower, Financial Venture Studio and Citi. Soon after covering the shocking allegations, the company reached out to TechCrunch with a statement from Curtis, who struck back at former employees. Essentially, Curtis said the company \u201cregretted\u201d that \u201csome former employees felt disappointed\u201d that the company \u201cwould not go beyond the scope\u201d of its mission and invest its \u201cresources in addressing systemic, societal issues affecting LGBTQ+ people.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re equally sad that we could not meet their personal expectations of start-up culture and continue to wish them the best in the future.\u201d The former employees alleged age and wage discrimination, whistleblower retaliation and fraud. For example, Terrance Knox who is Black claimed to have made $85,000 less than his white peers. The lawsuit also alleges that Curtis made up a projection that Daylight would process $500 million in transactions by the end of 2023. The CEO told TechCrunch that the former employees claims were fabricated, adding: We disagree wholeheartedly with their negative characterization of our business, and Daylight is fully prepared to address these concerns in court.\u201d At the time of its seed raise, the company said its products were designed to promote financial equality and inclusion for the estimated 30-million-plus Americans who identify as LGBTQ+. The startup also planned to build out a LGBTQ+ business marketplace and a platform that offered discounts and rewards when members shop at merchants whose actions support the queer community.

        "Extracted Article": "TuSimple, the once high-flying autonomous trucks company that went public in 2021, is restructuring and laying off about 30% of its global workforce as it works to preserve cash and stay in business. All of the layoffs will occur in TuSimples U.S. workforce. \u201cPrior to the layoff, TuSimple had about 550 employees in the U.S. and post reduction in force the company will have about 220, according to the company. We believe this is the right number of employees to work toward achieving our goals while preserving the cash on our balance sheet as well as retain strong publicly listed company capabilities,\u201d according to an emailed statement from TuSimple. The announcement early Thursday comes a week after the company disclosed that it received a delisting notice from the Nasdaq for failing to file its quarterly report on time. TuSimple hasn\u2019t filed a quarterly report for the fourth quarter or full-year results. It last reported earnings for the quarter ended September 30. It also said Thursday it will not be able to file first-quarter earnings in a timely manner. Shares were up more than 14% following the disclosure. TuSimple was supposed to be delisted May 15, but was able to get a temporary reprieve from Nasdag as a panel at the exchange reviews its case. This is the second restructuring in five months. TuSimple laid off 25% of its workforce in December, a couple of weeks after the companys deal to co-develop purpose-built autonomous semi trucks with Navistar fell apart. The company also said Thursday that it plans to keep its Chinese-based subsidiaries and is no longer exploring a sale. TuSimple noted that these subsidiaries have continued to make progress working with several OEMs on Level 4 and Level 2+ commercial projects. Its unclear if keeping the Chinese parts of the company will threaten its standing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The company was reportedly planning to sell its China subsidiary due to tight regulations and scrutiny in both countries. However, selling its Asia-Pacific (APAC) subsidiaries was never a CFIUS imposed requirement, TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu told TechCrunch. As management, in 2022, we felt the APAC operations were not being fully valued by the market and we understand the geopolitical sensitivity of having operations in both the U.S. and China in todays environment. So we started a divestment exploration process, Lu said, adding that APAC operations have continued to make significant commercial progress and the company believes its best interest to no longer explore a divestment. Correction: The laid off workers represent 30% of global workforce. All of the layoffs are occurring in the United States."

        "Extracted Article": "Autonomous delivery robot startup Nuro will lay off 30%, or about 340 employees, across the company as part of a restructuring meant to extend its capital runway, according to the company. Earlier this week, Nuro co-founders Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu explained in a blog post that the company would cut staff and shift resources away from commercial operations and toward R&amp;D. Nuro will pause plans to ramp up commercial operations this year and delay volume production of its Nuro bot \u2014 the third-generation, or R3, delivery robot designed to be the flagship of its commercial strategy. Nuro will be able to operate twice as long by making these changes, giving it enough capital to operate another three years without raising more money, according to Ferguson and Zhu. This is the second time in less than a year that Nuro \u2014 a darling of the AV world that has raised $2.13 billion \u2014 has laid off workers in a bid to cut costs and extend capital runway. In November, Nuro laid off about 300 people, or 20%, of its workforce. Laid off employees will receive 12 weeks of severance, plus two additional weeks for employees with two or more years of tenure. Eligible employees will also receive 62.5% of target bonus (prorated for new hires) or payment of spring bonus amounts for employees on a biannual performance bonus. The company will also provide healthcare through September 30 and support to employees who hold visas."

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox laid off around 50 employees \u2014 or 13% of its workforce \u2014 on Tuesday, the company told TechCrunch. The layoffs come just a few days after the company threw a party at the cybersecurity conference RSA, where the company apparently served branded drinks that it called \u201ccyber soup.\u201d Bishop Fox\u2019s official Twitter account said last week that the company will have \u201cother events in Vegas later this year,\u201d referring to the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences held every year in Las Vegas. Bishop Fox spokesperson Kevin Kosh said in an email that the company had an event space at RSA \u201creserved many months in advance and was primarily secured for the purposes of the day-long livestream (mirroring the one we did for DefCon), which was a forum to engage, and share knowledge with the larger community. The reception followed that for the participants, team, industry friends and RSA attendees.\u201d The company declined to say how much it spent on the RSA party. Kosh confirmed that the company had around 400 employees before the layoffs yesterday. Last night was so much fun! Thanks to everyone who hung out with us after our #RSAC #BFLive event at @HotelZeppelin, and experienced the #ArtOfCyber with us! Where to next? Maybe \u2026 Vegas this summer? \ud83e\udd73#RSAConference #RSAC2023 pic.twitter.com/NTSoZMDD5n &mdash; Bishop Fox (@bishopfox) April 27, 2023 \u201cWe proactively made these changes in response to the global economic situation and opportunities we identified to make our business more efficient. While demand for our solutions remains solid and our business is stable, we can\u2019t ignore the market uncertainty and investment trends in this very different global economy,\u201d Bishop Fox CEO Vinnie Liu said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. \u201cBishop Fox remains healthy, and we continue to be bullish about our growth and technology investments over the coming quarters and years. Our firm\u2019s cash reserves (including our Series B raise), combined with this restructuring, allow us to maintain a strong financial position that enables scale, innovation, and of course, delivery of the high-quality solutions our customers have come to expect.\u201d Last year, Bishop Fox raised a total of $129 million in a Series B round from several investors, including WestCap, NextEquity Partners and Rockpool Capital. And last week, the company announced at RSA that it was expanding to the U.K. with \u201can initial focus on organizations in Northern Europe.\u201d In the announcement, the company also said that it had \u201ca 40% year-over-year company growth.\u201d Employees who said they lost their job on Twitter called the layoffs \u201cunexpected.\u201d One of them said it was \u201cdue to internal restructuring.\u201d In September 2022, the company\u2019s vice president of customer success Christie Terrill said the company was \u201chiring across the board,\u201d and the company\u2019s official LinkedIn account wrote in a post that it was \u201chiring across several different teams in the Fox Den, from pentesting to technical editing to sales.\u201d The layoffs at Bishop Fox come as the whole tech sector is suffering from the economic downturn. Still, some considered cybersecurity to be a safer sector. Last year, a report from (ISC)\u00b2, a nonprofit association for \u201cinformation security leaders,\u201d predicted that cybersecurity teams \u201cwill be the least affected by staff reductions, as organizations anticipate an increase in cyber threats in 2023.\u201d The report was based on a poll of 1,000 C-suite executives. At the time, (ISC)\u00b2 chief executive Clar Rosso said that \u201cthe importance placed on cybersecurity professionals, even during uncertain economic times, suggests that top executives understand the critical need for a strong cybersecurity team now more than ever.\u201d Do you have more information about the layoffs at Bishop Fox?

        "Extracted Article": "Poparazzi, the once-hot photo-sharing app that hit the top of the App Store in 2021, is shutting down. The company announced the news via a Medium blog late last week, informing users that the app would be discontinued and users had until June 30, 2023 to download their content. Last year, Poparazzis founders at TTYL Inc. said the app had grown to 5+ million total installs and confirmed its raise of $15 million in Series A funding. Though Poparazzi had felt at the time like an overnight sensation, co-founder and CEO Alex Ma and his brother, co-founder Austen Ma, had spent three years developing apps and pivoting to achieve the success they generated with Poparrazis launch. In a 2022 interview with TechCrunch, Alex said Poparrazi was actually the 11th or 12th app that was generated by those efforts. Among those was the audio social network, TTYL, a sort of \u201cClubhouse for friends, which their company is also named for. Poparrazi, however, generated a lot of hype soon after its release, climbing the charts to reach No. 1 on the App Store. The concept behind the app was a photo-sharing-focused social network that essentially took Instagrams tagging feature and turned it into the entire experience. On Poparazzi, users could tag their friends but couldnt post photos of their own. The idea was that this would create a more authentic type of social network, as photos wouldnt necessarily be the polished, perfected images that fill Instagram, but rather the casual moments that make up peoples real lives. Image Credits: Poparazzi Last June, the company confirmed its $15 million Series A raise led by Benchmarks Sarah Tavel, who beat out a16z for the deal. The startup had previously raised $2 million in seed funding, led by Floodgate, in a round that included other investors like SV Angel, Shrug Capital and various angels. At the time, Poparazzi said its funds would give its team of 15 a runway of over two years. But soon, there were signs that Poparazzis time could be coming to an end. In August 2022, TechCrunch spotted the team was now dabbling with a new app, Made with Friends, that offered a twist on Poparazzi\u2019s original concept of social networking profiles crafted by a user\u2019s friends. Made with Friends instead asked its users to post all sorts of content to their friends profiles, not just photos. For example, they could post text-based content like answers to questions or prompts, as well as videos. The app had been available as a pre-release at that time, but its since been removed from the App Store sometime after March 26 of this year, app intelligence firm Apptopia confirmed to TechCrunch. Usage for Poparrazi had also been slowing post-launch, the firm noted. It estimated there were 6.2 million lifetime installs for the app, but it now has only around 2,000-3,000 monthly active users (MAUs) after reaching a height of 4 million MAUs previously. In its blog post, Poparrazi didnt confirm its future plans, if any, only noting the impending shutdown and thanking its community and supporters. We\u2019ve been incredibly blessed to work with an amazing team of passionate designers, engineers, and marketers to help bring this movement to life. And none of this would have been possible without the backing from the most supportive, world-class group of investors, wrote Alex Ma, in the announcement. To our community, we are so grateful for the support and belief that you have shown us throughout our journey. Your enthusiasm and passion for Poparazzi has been the driving force behind everything we\u2019ve done. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. TTYL Inc. has been asked for comment. Alex Ma responded, after publication, that while the company didn\u2019t have an official statement to share, they could confirm it was winding down and would be returning capital to investors. The team, however, will stay together and work on other projects. Updated 5/1/23, 8:53 pm et with company response."

        "Extracted Article": "Chief, a professional network designed for women in leadership, has cut 14% of staff, or 43 jobs today, saying in an email seen by TechCrunch that the move is a response to the economy and that the outfit is restructuring to further focus on member experience. The layoff largely hit Chief\u2019s U.S. employees as the business\u2019s newly launched U.K. presence is smaller. Around 262 employees remain at the company. Those who were impacted received at least 12 weeks of severance and continued healthcare insurance. Chief closed its New York office for today as employees process the news. Chief co-founders Lindsay Kaplan and Carolyn Childers wrote the email to staff explaining the decision. Beyond attributing the \u201cchallenging macroeconomic environment\u201d that has plagued a vast number of tech startups over the past year, the duo highlighted four priorities for the business going forward: more in-person opportunity, personalization to support members, simplification of the digital experience, and lastly, to continue \u201cto embed diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging into all aspects of the Chief experience.\u201d The last priority that was emphasized by the co-founders \u2014 to bring diversity into all of the Chief experience \u2014 comes less than one month after the New York Times published a story looking into turmoil at the business over some members perspective that Chief should speak up on social and economic issues that impact marginalized women. Around 33% of Chief\u2019s membership base identifies as coming from a diverse background, down from 35% in October. The company recently hit 20,000 members. At TechCrunch Disrupt last year, Chief\u2019s co-founders spoke to the \u201cextra scrutiny\u201d that mission-oriented companies receive. \u201cFor Lindsay and I, that has always just been like, the forefront of everything that we have thought about as we thought about the teams and the culture and what we want to build,\u201d Childers said. \u201cWe have actually felt that more because we are a mission-based company, than being women CEOs or founders.\u201d https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/yes-chief-disrupt-2022/?utm_source=internalutm_medium=WPunit Kaplan added that the extra scrutiny \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like a ticking time bomb. It\u2019s us making sure that we\u2019re always walking the walk and practicing what we preach.\u201d Chief clearly wants staff, members and the world to know that it is focused on experience. The workforce reduction comes one week after the business announced that it hired another executive: Sujean Lee, former chief experience officer at HypeBeast, as Chief\u2019s first chief experience officer. The company hit a $1.1 billion valuation in a matter of three years, last raising a $100 million Series B round led by Alphabet\u2019s CapitalG in 2022. Like many others, valuations have been harder and harder to defend as the market worsens. For example, 70% of Chief members see their membership, which costs up to $7,900 annually, paid for by employers. Now those same employers are looking for expenses to cut and are slashing workforces themselves. Chief declined to comment on the layoff and financials beyond the e-mail."

According to an email to employees from CEO Marc Friend viewed by TechCrunch, the move is part of \u201ca significant restructuring\u201d in an effort to \u201cright-size the company.\u201d In the email, Friend said that Rapid tried \u201cto compete on too many fronts\u201d as a product company. He added: \u201cWe have grown large as an organization and often sacrificed agility. Moving forward, we will be disciplined on our product focus and ruthless about customer success.\u201d Friend only last week took over the role of chief executive of the company. CEO and founder Iddo Gino is now a technical advisor, per a company announcement. The layoffs are believed to have impacted 115 people and are hitting workers across Europe, Tel Aviv and San Francisco, according to a source familiar with internal happenings at the company. The email which went out on Monday said only that a large number of employees would be let go in the next few days. Workers across several departments including sales, talent acquisition, engineering, product and marketing are said to have been affected. The company has confirmed to TechCrunch that it expects to reduce its team size by around 50% and close all open roles, but it declined to confirm the specific number of individuals affected. In a statement via email, a spokesperson said: Following the path of many technology companies recently, our new incoming CEO and the Board have made the difficult decision to implement a restructuring and will be saying goodbye to many of our friends and colleagues. The decision to reduce the number of employees and rebalance investments is one we don\u2019t take lightly. RapidAPI built a platform that helps businesses find and integrate third-party APIs, as well as manage their own usage of their own internal APIs. It raised $150 million in March of 2022 in a Series D round led by SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund 2. Other backers include Qumra, Andreessen Horowitz, M12 (Microsoft\u2019s Venture Fund), Viola Growth, Green Bay and Grove Ventures. Last November, RapidAPI announced it had rebranded to Rapid and that more than 4 million developers used its public API hub. That hub, it claimed, had grown to among the world\u2019s largest giving developers the ability to integrate more than 40,000 APIs from companies such as Twilio, Microsoft and Google. At the time, it touted new enterprise customers such as ATA, Poly, Formula 1\u2019s Scuderia AlphaTauri and Sun Life Financial. It also boasted that it had doubled its company employees in the past year to 200. RapidAPI also opened a new European headquarters in Berlin last July.

All of the company\u2019s remaining workers in Europe, and some based in the U.S., were impacted by the latest round, according to the source. Founded in 2015 by then-17-year-old Iddo Gino, RapidAPI built a platform that helps businesses find and integrate third-party APIs, as well as manage their own usage of their own internal APIs.

The layoffs came as the company saw its revenue plummet in the fourth quarter and its operating losses expand. Shift closed its merger with CarLotz in December and immediately eliminated duplicate costs and roles, Clementz said during Tuesdays earnings call.

While difficult, we reduced headcount by approximately 30% in the first quarter, Clementz said on the call. In addition to corporate roles, the majority of reductions were due to our move to decentralized sales organization, which occurred in February. He added that the CarLotz integration and strategic moves to rightsize our SG&amp;A are largely behind us. Shift Technologies, which went public in 2020 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, reported it generated $65.6 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, a 67% drop from the same year-ago period. Shift reported an operating loss of $60.7 million in the fourth quarter, a 14% increase from the same period in 2021. Shift did report net income of $13 million in the fourth quarter compared to a net loss of $75.8 million in the same quarter in 2021. However, much of that was due to the one-time gain of $76.7 million from its acquisition of CarLotz. Shift had a net loss of $172 million in 2022, up from the $162.2 million loss it reported the year prior. Notably, the companys gross profit per unit fell 42% between 2021 and 2022 to $1,208 per vehicle. The earnings report caused Shift shares to fall. Share fell nearly 28% on Wednesday to $1.21. However, the share price is still hovering above $1, which has allowed the company to regain the Nasdaq exchange listing requirement."

        "Extracted Article": "Lucid Group, the U.S. automaker that produces the luxury all-electric Air sedan, is cutting its workforce by 18% as part of a restructuring, the company disclosed in a regulatory filing. The layoffs, which will affect 1,300 employees, will be completed by the end of the second quarter. Lucid expects to incur about $24 million to $30 million in charges connected with its restructuring plan, namely due to severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. The layoffs will be across the organization and will include executive positions. CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson said in an email to workers that the restructuring is the result of its evolving business needs and productivity improvements. He said the move is aligned with a cost-reduction announcement made in late February. While the company has reduced costs, it was not enough to avoid layoffs, according to the email. Consequently, weve made the painful but necessary decision to let some of our talented team members go, Rawlinson wrote, adding that impacted employees will be offered a severance package that includes access to career resources, Lucid-paid healthcare coverage continuation and acceleration of equity. We are also taking continued steps to manage our costs by reviewing all non-critical spending at this time, he wrote. Rawlinson said the decisions are designed to position the company to be more resilient and agile and strengthen the company for the long-term. He also said that Lucid still intends to launch the Gravity SUV in 2024. Last month, Lucid reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings that missed Wall Street expectations. The company also lowered its 2023 annual production target to 10,000 to 14,000, roughly half of the 20,000 to 22,000 deliveries analysts had expected for the year. That was the third time in a year that the company lowered its production goals. In August, Lucid Motors slashed its annual production guidance in half due to what Rawlinson described as \u201cextraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges.\u201d Lucid lowered its production guidance from 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles to 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles for 2022. That\u2019s just a quarter of the 20,000 luxury Air sedans the company initially planned to produce in 2022. In February 2022, Lucid adjusted that loftier goal down to 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles."

        "Extracted Article": "Proptech company Roofstock has laid off about 27% of its staff today, according to an email sent to employees that was viewed by TechCrunch. The cuts come just five months after the startup laid off 20% of its workforce. The companys website states that it has 400+ employees, or Roofsters, as theyre dubbed, but it is not known if that figure is current. Roofstock, an online marketplace for investing in leased single-family rental homes, one year ago raised $240 million at a $1.9 billion valuation. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led that financing, which saw participation from existing and new backers including Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and others. Roofstock has raised a total of over $365 million in funding since its 2015 inception, per Crunchbase. According to the email, co-founder and CEO Gary Beasley said today\u2019s reduction in force (RIF) was \u201cin response to the challenging macro environment\u201d and the \u201cnegative impact\u201d it is having on Roofstock\u2019s business. He added that the company was not expecting to have to cut more staff so soon, but that it needed to \u201cright size\u201d in an effort \u201cto reduce cash burn rate\u201d and ensure it has \u201cadequate capital runway until the market eventually turns.\u201d Beasley sent the email because apparently the Zoom meeting where the layoff was addressed had \u201cmaxed out on attendees.\u201d Oakland, California-based Roofstock lets people buy and sell rental homes in dozens of U.S. markets. The premise behind the company is that both institutional and retail investors can buy and sell homes without forcing renters to leave their homes. Meanwhile, buyers can also presumably generate income from day one. At the time of its fundraise in March 2022, the company said that it had facilitated more than $5 billion in transaction volume, more than half of which had come from the last year alone. Just days before its last round of layoffs last year, Roofstock made headlines for selling its first single-family home using NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Rising mortgage rates and a slowdown in the housing market led to challenges for many real estate technology companies in 2022 that continue this year. Opendoor, Redfin, Compass, Better.com and Homeward are among the other startups that have also laid off workers. IBuyer company Reali last August said it was shutting down, just a year after raising $100 million. TechCrunch has reached out to Roofstock but had not heard back at the time of writing, but multiple sources confirmed that layoffs had taken place today."

        "Extracted Article": "Course Hero, a tutoring business last valued by investors at $3.6 billion, has cut 15% of staff, or 42 people \u2014 its first round of layoffs in 17 years, TechCrunch has learned from numerous sources. A spokesperson confirmed the layoffs, saying that the layoffs are happening as a part of a strategic effort to set Course Hero business line up for future growth. The company says it does not anticipate future layoffs. Part of this transition support includes providing several months of severance, health care benefits through the end of June, outplacement and immigration support services, and we are working with individuals with special circumstances to make sure we do everything we can to ease their transition, a spokesperson said. The workforce reduction comes after Course Hero itself, a rare edtech unicorn, saw co-founder Andrew Grauer leave his post as chief executive four months ago. Course Hero then was put under a parent company, Learneo, which took that multibillion-dollar valuation and named Grauer as CEO. He was succeeded by John Peacock, who was formerly the VP of product at the company. The layoff appears to be one of the new CEO\u2019s first significant changes to the business since taking over. Peacock sent an email to staff this week explaining the changes. \u201cThis is the first time in Course Hero\u2019s 17 years that we have done a layoff of this size, and it\u2019s not a decision we made lightly,\u201d the email, obtained by TechCrunch, reads. \u201cIt follows careful deliberation with the leadership team about the moment we\u2019re in.\u201d He went on to say that the layoff was done to meet the needs of the \u201crapidly evolving\u201d sector and that it was \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the future of the company. Launched in 2006, Course Hero was somewhat allergic to venture capital until recently. After launching, the company waited eight years to raise a $15 million Series A. Then, after going another nearly six years without raising venture capital, Course Hero closed two financings in 2020. For Course Hero, venture capital was once an unobvious solution Then in 2021, the edtech company announced yet another tranche of capital: a $380 million Series C at a $3.6 billion valuation. It brought a 227.3% increase to Course Hero\u2019s valuation in a little over a year. With fresh capitalization and a broader vision of its total addressable market, the company began scooping up businesses, including Scribbr and LitCharts, a SparkNotes spinoff. It\u2019s unclear how the acquisition cadence will change given today\u2019s scale-back, if at all. The business tells TechCrunch that Course Hero and Learneo are cash-flow positive and profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis.

Klaviyo\u2019s director of public relations, Lacey Berrien, confirmed the workforce reduction over email, adding that their \u201cfocus is supporting the departing Klaviyos who made meaningful contributions to the company.\u201d Using publicly available figures on Klaviyo\u2019s staff size, the layoff has impacted roughly 10% of staff. TechCrunch obtained correspondence sent from leadership to impacted employees which stated, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce in an effort to reduce redundancy and recalibrate Klaviyo\u2019s areas of investment for the future. Now, unfortunately, Klaviyo is joining the long list of tech companies that have had mass layoffs in 2023. In January, HubSpot, another Boston-based marketing giant, announced its plans to cut 7% of its workforce. TechCrunch extensively profiled the Boston-based business\u2019 history of growth and goal to rebuild owned marketing outside of the pandemic. The business, at its core, helps other businesses better capture its customer\u2019s cash with email triggers, product recommendations and predictive analytics. To date, it has landed more than 100,000 users, it claims, including the likes of Unilever and Living Proof. The heavily venture-backed business last received a $100 million strategic investment from Shopify, per SEC filings. Months later, the business made its first acquisition ever by scooping up Napkin.io, a tool that gives developers a more seamless way to deploy code from their browsers. Today, though, the picture of clear growth is challenged, or at the very least, set in new context. Its unclear if the company is going to instill a hiring freeze as well, but it still has 65 open job listings on its careers page. https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/tech-industry-layoffs/?utm_source=internalutm_medium=WPunit If you have a juicy tip or lead about happenings in the venture world, you can reach Natasha Mascarenhas on Twitter @nmasc_ or on Signal at +1 925 271 0912.

And the pain may not be over as CEO Alex Rodrigues noted in an email to employees that the remaining 30% of workers will focus on winding down operations. The company said in a regulatory filing that about 230 employees were laid off Friday. A source familiar with the plan said the cuts were announced Friday morning. The layoffs are expected to occur in the first and second quarters. Unfortunately, after thoroughly evaluating all alternatives, we have been unable to identify a path forward for the business in its current form, Rodrigues wrote, later adding Today, having exhausted all alternatives, we are taking the incredibly difficult step of laying off ~70% of the company, and shutting down our SoCal and Houston offices. The layoffs come more than a month after banking advisory firm Evercore met with various AV companies to explore selling Embarks assets, according to one source. A sale of assets appears to be the next order of business, according to a regulatory filing posted Friday and Rodrigues email. Embarks board approved Wednesday a process to explore, review and evaluate a range of potential strategic alternatives available to the company, including alternative uses of its assets to commercialize its technology, additional sources of financing, as well as potential dissolution or liquidation of its assets. The board\u2019s decision comes following an extended evaluation by the company of alternative markets in which to commercialize its technology as well as an exploration, performed with the assistance of a financial advisor, of a potential sale of the company, the filling said. Embark Trucks was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak and quickly got the attention of investors. Rodrigues and Moak met while working on self-driving technology at the University of Waterloo, where both completed Mechatronics engineering degrees. By 2018, the startup had raised about $47 million. But it was the SPAC boom that really delivered the capital \u2014 at least for a short time. In 2021, agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II in a deal valued at $5.2 billion. Today, Embark Trucks is running short on capital like other companies trying to develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. The companys market capitalization is about $90 million; at the end of the third quarter, the most recent quarterly report the company has filed, it had about $190 million in cash and cash equivalents.

The software consultancy firm laid off about 4% of its global workforce \u2014 approximately 500 employees \u2014 a figure that the company did not dispute when reached for comment on Wednesday. TechCrunch learned that the company initially informed its affected employees about the decision on Tuesday, and the layoffs will continue in the coming days. We confirm that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by about four percent globally, Thoughtworks global public relations head Linda Horiuchi said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. We did not make this decision lightly and regret that we had to say goodbye to some talented and passionate Thoughtworkers. These changes were necessary to support the future growth of our business. Thoughtworks has over 12,500 employees across 18 countries on five continents, including the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The company also has a strong presence in India, though the spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the move did not include any layoffs in the country. Earlier this week, Thoughtworks reported an 8.3% year-over-year surge in quarterly revenue compared to the same period last year, totaling more than $310 million. This revenue growth also contributed to the companys net income of $16.1 million in the fourth quarter, an improvement from its loss of almost $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. The Chicago-headquartered company also forecast to generate revenue between $303 million and $305 million in the current quarter and anticipated a year-over-year growth in revenue of between 0.5% and 2.5% for the overall year.

The reduction is coming about two months after South Korean internet firm Naver completed its acquisition of the company earlier this year for $1.2 billion. Naver agrees to acquire fashion marketplace Poshmark for $1.2B Poshmark confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is cutting its workforce due to the economic slowdown but did not disclose the number of people impacted. We made the difficult decision to reduce the size of some of our teams to better align with our priorities for the future, the current economic climate and our return to being a private company, a spokesperson at Poshmark told TechCrunch. We are incredibly grateful for the contributions of the talented people in the roles that were impacted. It also did not disclose the number of total employees at the company, nor whether the layoffs would be in the U.S. only or globally. On its LinkedIn Profile, it describes itself as having over 800 employees. We have asked the questions and will update this post as we learn more. Update, 2/24/23, 9:05 AM ET: The spokesperson told TechCrunch that less than 2% of its workforce was affected, primarily in the U.S. The affected employees were notified this week, the spokesperson said, adding that Poshmark offered each employee financial support, continued full healthcare coverage and outplacement services. Poshmarks job cuts come as a number of tech companies are also downsizing their workforces. As the economy dips, tech companies, in particular, have seen their businesses slow down, and so they are turning to layoffs as part of bigger cost-cutting strategies to focus more on profitability. That is a trend that has not spared fashion e-commerce, with others like Everlane and StitchFix collectively laying off hundreds of employees in recent months. Founded in 2011, Poshmark claims to have more than 80 million registered users across the U.S., Canada, Australia and India. It was delisted from Nasdaq after the Naver acquisition was completed, but according to the last accounts it filed in 2021, it had an annual gross merchandise volume of $1.8 billion and posted net revenues of $44.4 million in Q3 2022, an 11% year-on-year increase, with a gross merchandise value of $475.6 million in the same period. At the time of Navers acquisition, Poshmarks leadership touted the scaling potential and technology investments that would come with the deal. As a part of Naver, well benefit from their financial resources, significant technology capabilities and leading presence across Asia to expand our platform and enhance our user experience for the Poshmark community and create additional value for all our stakeholders, founder and CEO of Poshmark Manish Chandra said in its statement earlier this year. [We] look forward to seeing Poshmark employees benefit from being part of a larger, global organization who shares our values and vision around content, community and empowerment. During its press conference in San Francisco last month, Poshmark unveiled a new shopping feature, Posh Lens, which will enable users to find a list of similar products on the Poshmark platform when they take a picture of a product using Posh Lens. CEO of Naver, Sooyeon Choi, said in its statement in January that Naver technologies like its search engine, AI recommendation and e-commerce tools, would all get incorporated into Poshmark to enhance the user experience on the platform. 3 takeaways from the Poshmark-Naver deal"

The startup has built smart farming software and hardware for farmers to digitize the entire agriculture value chain, from crop to distribution. Shin told me the companys Farm Morning app aggregates farm data, then artificial intelligence gives insights into crop lifecycle and also provides a network through which farmers can connect and share insights. Indeed, 900,000 farmers currently use the app in South Korea, and that figure has tripled in the past 12 months since its launch in 2021, Shin said. It also operates B2B marketplace Sinsun Market, and it has the ambition to be a LinkedIn for farmers, Shin added.

This time, Shin walked me through what happened to the company and how it plans to revive. The major cause was its new service, accounts receivable factoring, also known as invoice discounting. Green Labs purchases agriculture products from farmers and sells them to buyers/B2B partners with outstanding invoices. In other words, the startup pays farmers and buyers early and receives money from them late. It has thousands of B2B partners, according to Shin. The problem arose when South Koreas bond market froze in the second half of last year due to the default of the theme park Legoland. Financial firms began to suspend factoring financing of accounts receivables as market uncertainties grew. Green Labs was borrowing money for cash liquidity with credit sales as collateral, but its lender, Lotte Card, suspended the factoring financing late last year, and the startup had to repay massive loans all at once. Green Labs had to go through with restructuring and layoffs. Shin said the company generated sales of approximately $77 million in 2021 and more than $230 million in 2022. The new money will go toward advancing the farm morning app and expanding its business in South Korea and Japan, Shin said. Green Labs already has 300,000 users in Japan after launching there in the fall of last year. When asked about its invoice discounting service, Shin said Green Labs will continue to act as a middleman for farmers and buyers, but will manage the business in a more conservative manner. Its global peers include Dehaart and Farmers Business Network. After the last funding, the companys two investors, BRV Capital Management and Skylake, became the largest shareholder of Green Labs, while other investors, including SK Square and Shin, own the rest. Farmers Business Network just raked in a whopping $110 million in Series D funding Indian agritech DeHaat tops $700 million valuation in $60 million funding"

        "Extracted Article": "Months after acquiring Evernote, Milan-based app developer Bending Spoons has made steep cuts at the note-taking and task management app. Layoffs took place at Evernote on Friday, February 17, an Evernote spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch, affecting 129 people. This was a difficult yet necessary decision as we pursue our ambitious plans for Evernote, a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. The company has been unprofitable for years and the situation was unsustainable in the long term. The spokesperson wouldnt confirm which specific departments were impacted. But posts on LinkedIn and Blind suggest the layoffs touched a wide range of core Evernote teams, including the product design, engineering, HR, sales, customer service and marketing departments. Evernote has indeed had its ups and downs over the past few decades, with mass layoffs in 2015 and 2018 a year which also saw an exodus of top execs including Evernote\u2019s chief technical officer, chief financial officer, chief product officer and head of HR. But the company appeared to have turned things around more or less, reporting $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within the last five years. Its unlikely Bending Spoons, for its part, was badly hurting for liquidity. The company recently closed a $340 million venture round and eclipsed $100 million in ARR last September. So whats the explanation for the cuts? It could be as simple as Bending Spoons priming Evernote for profitability. No doubt, the corporate parent wants a quick return on its investment, and its perhaps feeling additional pressure from investors. (Bending Spoons was bootstrapped until relatively recently.) But its also true that Evernote wasnt particularly competitive. Despite its reported high ARR, prior to the acquisition, the company largely failed to keep pace with competitors like Notion opting to rely heavily on a consumer-focused freemium model while eschewing the kinds of collaboration features embraced by its rivals. In any case, staffers are an unfortunate casualty of the circumstances."

        "Extracted Article": "Convoy, the Seattle-based digital freight network that connects truckers with shippers, is shuttering its Atlanta office and laying off workers as part of a restructuring. This is the third time in less than a year that Convoy has laid off workers. The restructuring comes as Convoy transitions to a new customer service model that automates many of the tasks conducted by employees, according to a LinkedIn post published Thursday by CEO and co-founder Dan Lewis. This shift represents a big step forward in how we operate, but it comes at a cost. Increased automation and tighter focus have changed our staffing needs, Lewis wrote. Convoy will shut down its Atlanta office. It will maintain a small team in the city, according to the post. Jobs in other regions will also be cut, including those tied to its changing customer service model and other aspects of the business. A spokesperson confirmed the move and said, We have restructured to further streamline and improve our shipper experience. The company declined to disclose how many workers are losing their jobs. Convoy launched in 2015 to modernize freight brokerage, a fragmented and oftentimes analog business that matches loads from shippers with truckers. The company developed software that helps automate the process of connecting truckers and shippers. It has since added more fintech products to its digital platform, including a fuel card, quick payments and a drop-and-hook service that allows shippers to pre-load Convoy trailers and set them aside so truckers can pick them up during more flexible windows. Convoy cut 7% of its workforce in June just three months after raising $260 million in equity and debt. The Series E equity was led by Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price and the $100 million venture-debt investment came from Hercules Capital. Convoys valuation was $3.8 billion at the time. More layoffs followed in October. &nbsp;"

        "Extracted Article": "Customer experience firm Sprinklr has laid off roughly 4% of its global workforce \u2014 or more than 100 employees \u2014 as it realigns its headcount amid the ongoing economic slowdown. Sprinklr started the layoff drive last week and is cutting its workforce in India, the U.S. and other regions, TechCrunch learned from people familiar with the matter and confirmed with the company through an email. A Sprinklr spokesperson said that the strategic business decision affected employees across certain targeted regions, segments and support functions. While these decisions are extremely hard to make, it is the right decision for our long-term success as we shift from a capacity-driven to productivity-driven business model, the spokesperson said in a prepared statement. Our first priority is to support our employees with the greatest care and respect, show appreciation for their contributions to Sprinklr, and to assist them in their transition. We then will realign with a focus on making it easier to sell, and to deliver profitable growth to the business. On February 7, the New York-based firm notified the initial batch of its affected employees. It confirmed to TechCrunch that the decision did not impact any C-level executives. Sprinklr did not disclose the exact number of employees being laid off due to the decision. The company had 3,245 employees as of January 31, 2022, according to an SEC filing (PDF). Of the total headcount at the time, 933 were based in the United States and 2,312 were based internationally, including 1,580 in India. In the last few months, Sprinklr has partnered with entities including Samsung, Sitel Group and Europes largest department store, El Corte to enhance shopping experiences for their customers. However, the current economic uncertainty in the market is likely to push companies to cut back on non-essential expenses, including marketing and social media management, which may lead to a decrease in demand for Sprinklrs services. This is not the first time that Sprinklr laid off its employees in the past year. In July, the company reportedly cut at least 50 roles in its global marketing department. In its Q3 earnings, Sprinklr reported a 24% year-on-year increase in its revenue to $157.3 million from $127.1 million a year ago. The companys operating loss in the quarter was $4.6 million, down from $24.8 million a year ago. Sprinklrs shares traded at $11.02 per share on Tuesday, with a market cap of $2.87 billion."

        "Extracted Article": "Peer-to-peer car-sharing company Getaround is laying off 10% of staff starting Thursday. The layoffs are part of a restructure aimed to put Getaround on the path to sustainable profitability and long-term growth, the company said in a statement. Per LinkedIn, Getaround has 421 employees, so the staff cuts should affect around 42 employees. Getaround would not confirm the exact number, but a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch the layoffs exclusively affect North American teams across all departments. The news comes a day after Getaround received a delisting warning from the New York Stock Exchange because its stock price has been trading too low. Following the companys announcement, shares of Getaround spiked 17% after hours from $0.64 at market close to $0.75, but have since settled to around $0.65, which is still a 2.19% increase today. Getaround, which joined the public markets in December via a merger with InterPrivate II Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), said it would also significantly reduce other operating expenses like the companys contract workforce and outside professional services. Like almost every other executive over the past year who has ordered layoffs, Sam Zaid, Getarounds CEO, said the restructuring plan is a response to an uncertain near-term macroeconomic outlook, which has hit technology companies particularly hard. Getaround expects the restructuring to result in cost savings of between $25 million and $30 million on an annualized run-rate basis. Its not yet clear how the companys decision to go public through a SPAC merger has affected its balance sheets. The deal was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022, and Getaround has yet to set a date for its earnings release. Regulatory filings show Getarounds cash burn in the first nine months of 2022 was $63.2 million. The company reported $45 million in revenue for the same period, which is a decrease from $48 million the year prior. By the end of Q3, Getaround had $27.2 million in cash to play around with. The merger would have brought the company another $228 million of gross proceeds to stay in operation and achieve its next phase of growth. Despite the near-term infusion of cash, Getaround stood by its decision to cut staff, saying it is taking a multi-year view of the responsible fiscal actions required to maximize the use of proceeds in the face of an unclear economic environment. This article has been updated with more information from Getaround."

The company said Monday that Igor Torgov, former executive VP of digital at the company, has been hired as its CEO. Prior to Arrival, Torgov held a number of CEO, COO and other leadership positions at Atol, Bitfury, Yota, Columbus IT and Microsoft. The cuts announced Monday would reduce its workforce by 50%, to about 800 employees globally. Arrival said the layoffs along with other reductions in real estate and third-party spending will help it cut operating costs by $30 million a quarter. This is the third time since July that Arrival has taken drastic measures to stay viable. The company, which went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, announced in July a restructuring plan that included a 30% reduction in spending across the entire business that could \u201cpotentially impact up to 30% of employees globally.\u201d Arrival said, at the time, the plan would allow the company to meet its targets through late 2023 using the $500 million of cash it had on hand. As of December 31, 2022, that cash-on-hand number had dropped to $205 million. The company, which has centered its business plan around using microfactories to build its products, was initially focused on its electric bus product, which achieved certification in the European Union in May 2022. The plan was to start producing with customer models by the second half of the year. In October, just a few months from its first restructuring, the company said it was shifting its focus to the United States and away from the U.K. market, where it is headquartered and where the first EV vans were supposed to be delivered. Arrival said it expects to start production of the van in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2024, subject to raising additional capital."

I know, I know \u2014 Austin is known for its 100+ degree temperatures in the summertime. Who would have expected this to happen here? And not just once but twice in two years. Surely not I, when my family moved here in 2013. We\u2019re going on Day 5 with no power, heat or internet. That\u2019s why this newsletter is being published a day later than it would have under normal circumstances. Our neighborhood has many beautiful mature trees, including many oaks. It\u2019s one of the things we loved most about it when deciding to live here. It\u2019s also the same reason our neighborhood was hit SO hard by this storm. Branches from one of those trees fell on our power line, making the outage not just inconvenient but also scary. While this has been extremely stressful \u2014 my 89-year-old mother lives with us and our biggest priority has been trying to keep her warm and comfortable \u2014 there have been bright spots, like the kindness of a neighbor I\u2019d never met before sharing a wheelchair so I could transport my mother somewhere else and a friend who offered a portable generator so that we could at least have some power for a little while. Anyway, hopefully by the time I\u2019m writing this next week, we\u2019ll have our actual power back. Fingers crossed. Image Credits: Amy Tomlinson The layoffs keep coming There appears to be no end in sight for layoffs in the fintech space. PayPal was the latest large company to announce layoffs \u2014 with about 2,000 full-time employees, or 7% of its workforce, affected. On January 30, the payments giant publicly shared a letter that president and CEO Dan Schulman had sent to employees in which he noted the cuts would take place over the coming weeks \u201cwith some organizations impacted more than others.\u201d Schulman added: \u201cOver the past year, we made significant progress in strengthening and reshaping our company to address the challenging macro-economic environment\u2026While we have made substantial progress in right-sizing our cost structure, and focused our resources on our core strategic priorities, we have more work to do. We must continue to change as our world, our customers, and our competitive landscape evolve.\u201d He did not provide further details, saying only the company would provide the affected \u201cwith generous packages, engage in consultation where required, and support them with their transitions.\u201d The company\u2019s stock perked up on the news. After closing at $79.64 on January 30, shares closed up 7.4% at $85.52 on February 3. It\u2019s not the first round of layoffs for PayPal in recent times. Last spring, TechCrunch reported that PayPal had laid off dozens of employees from its San Jose headquarters around a week before the fintech confirmed that it was shuttering its San Francisco office. To better understand why it matters so much to us what publicly traded companies like PayPal do, head here. But PayPal was not the only publicly traded fintech to lay off employees last week. American Banker reported on January 30 that SoFi Technologies had cut some employees in its tech unit. A spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company had let go of less than 5% of its staff in its tech platform business unit. The company has about 1,300 employees. (Note: a previous version of this article stated that the layoffs had impacted its mortgage division). Meanwhile, Silicon Hills News (operated by the very talented Laura Lorek) reported that Austin-based insurtech Decent is \u201cshutting down all of its operations to just a core team,\u201d which was confirmed in a blog post published by Nick Soman, the company\u2019s founder and CEO. The company had raised $43 million in funding from investors such as Foundation Capital, QED Investors and Maverick Ventures, according to Silicon Hills. In his blog post, Soman said the company wound down its health insurance product in anticipation of signing on a partner, who recently backed out in what the founder called \u201ca massive and unexpected setback.\u201d And lastly (that we know of), DriveWealth confirmed that it has reduced its headcount by 20%, the company told TC\u2019s Natasha Mascarenhas. In a statement, DriveWealth told her that the cuts were part of \u201ca number of strategic decisions to evolve as a global brokerage infrastructure company, with a tech-focused and product- and partner-centric organization, and increased organizational agility. In January, DriveWealth CEO Terry Angelos announced on Twitter that he was \u201cleaving the digital custody and clearing firm just eight months after stepping into the role,\u201d according to InvestmentNews. (Note: Angelos told TechCrunch in February that he had actually operationally left the business in December prior to the layoffs, but only announced in January.) The company has raised over $550 million since its 2012 inception, according to Crunchbase. It last raised in August of 2021 \u2014 a $450 million Series D funding round at a $2.85 billion valuation. Insight Partners and Accel co-led that round. Other backers include Greyhound Capital, SoftBank Vision Fund and Point72 Ventures. According to PitchBook, DriveWealth has 300 employees, although it is not clear if that was before or after the recent layoffs. It\u2019s apparent that even well-funded companies are not immune to the challenging macroenvironment. In fact, is it just me or does it seem like it\u2019s the most well-funded companies that are doing the layoffs? Maybe since they had more resources and the ability to hire to begin with? Or maybe because they are more high-profile, news of their layoffs makes a bigger splash? I\u2019m not sure, but sadly I don\u2019t think the fintech job cuts are slowing down anytime soon. Stay tuned for a new section in upcoming newsletters that focuses on companies that are hiring, rather than laying off. Other weekly news Marqeta shared with me exclusively that it has agreed to acquire two-year-old fintech infrastructure startup Power Finance for $223 million in cash, marking the first acquisition in the publicly traded company\u2019s 13-year history. I had the opportunity to interview new CEO Simon Khalaf, who shared with me the reasoning behind the purchase. Power\u2019s first product is a credit card issuance program, which is designed for companies, brands and banks to offer fintech experiences, such as customized credit card programs, targeted promotions and personalized rewards, embedded into existing mobile and web applications. Marqeta\u2019s main goal with the purchase is to expand and \u201csignificantly accelerate the capabilities\u201d offered in its credit product. More details here.

Moov was born when CEO and founder Wade Arnold and Bob Smith started an open source movement in 2017 to help developers learn how to build and integrate payments into their products. Arnold had founded Banno, a white label digital banking platform, which was acquired by Jack Henry in 2014 (Smith was an employee). Their goal at the time of inception, Arnold said in 2020, was \u201cto lend a trusted hand to developers building or integrating financial products.\u201d It has since worked to build what Arnold describes as its \u201cfull-stack approach to powering payments.\u201d In the past, the company has been public about \u201ctaking business from Stripe.\u201d Still, at the time of Moov\u2019s last raise, Arnold told me: \u201cStripe simplified e-commerce checkout for all by putting developers first. Moov echoes the ethos in putting developers first but we\u2019re focused on the underpinning infrastructure of payments and banking. We would like to think that Stripe could have leveraged Moov if we existed when they started.\u201d Fun fact: In 2021, the startup created fintech_devcon, a flagship event for fintech developers. The third one will be held in August in my home base of Austin, Texas.

        "Extracted Article": "Around a year ago, Tier Mobility was winning the shared micromobility game. Fueled by its $200 million Series D fundraise in October 2021, the company went on to acquire three other micromobility operators and a computer vision startup, giving it access to e-bikes \u2014 a reach that extended beyond Europe and into the U.S. \u2014 and the tech needed to assuage politicians fears over safety. Today, Tier is in the midst of another round of layoffs. As a result of previous restructurings, Tier is laying off around 80 workers, some of whom are under the Nextbike umbrella, to make up for redundancies. Tier had purchased the German bike-share startup in November 2021 to expand its vehicle offerings beyond e-scooters. Tier said the layoffs announced Wednesday will affect 7% of its overall staff headcount. While some teams will be more affected than others, the restructuring affects employees across the organization. The most recent staff cuts follow Tiers decision to let 180 employees go back in August, blaming a poor funding environment and uncertain economic conditions. The micromobility operator is also reducing the size of its Spin workforce by about 20 employees. Tier originally bought Spin from Ford in March 2022, a move that gave the company widespread access to the U.S. Seven months later, Tier then laid off almost 80 Spin workers and exited Seattle and Canada. The company went on to let go of an additional 30 Spin employees in December when it decided to leave another 10 U.S. cities. A Tier spokesperson told TechCrunch the company tried to rematch workers from redundant roles with any open roles at Tier and Nextbike to retain as many people as possible. All-out growth mode to profitability first How did Tier go from being the largest micromobility player in the world to now announcing layoffs every few months? Sure, the macroeconomic climate has affected most tech companies, and Tier is hardly the only micromobility operator to announce staff cuts (lookin at you, Bird.) It seems that Tier, like most other tech companies facing hard decisions, was expanding for a pace of economic growth thats simply not being realized in pre-recession 2023. Tier CEO and co-founder Lawrence Leuschner said todays round of layoffs is part of a pivot in the companys overall strategy, from all-out growth mode to a profitability first mindset. The restructuring will include the closure of a small number of cities where we do not see a path to profitability due to factors like unfavorable regulatory approaches, said the company. Tier did not say which cities it would exit, but the operators future in Paris currently hangs in the balance as the city votes whether or not to renew the permits of Tier, Lime and Dott. However, the citys strict regulations might just make it unprofitable for Tier to be in Paris at this point. Tier is also shutting down a number of side projects, like its own vehicle design program and the Tier Energy Network, the companys plan to place charging stations in retail stores to incentivize riders to swap scooter batteries for rewards. On the other hand, the company will be winding up its monthly scooter subscription service, MyTier. Downsizing is challenging for any business and particularly difficult for a company like Spin, which has already made fundamental changes to the business to ensure its long-term future, said Philip Reinckens, CEO at Spin. We are confident that the measures to increase revenue while reducing costs via further integration with our parent company will accelerate the companys path to profitability.

        "Extracted Article": "Sophos is laying off about 10% of its global workforce, TechCrunch has learned. Sophos confirmed the layoffs in an email to TechCrunch. Sophos today announced an internal restructuring which has resulted in job losses and the start of consultation periods that potentially will affect 10% of our global employee base, said Jitendra Bulani, a spokesperson for Sophos. The company said the layoffs were to ensure the company achieves the optimal balance of growth and profitability, amid the ongoing and deepening economic global slowdown. TechCrunch learned that about 450 people were let go during this round of layoffs, though Sophos would not confirm the exact number of affected employees. TechCrunch first learned of the layoffs after hearing of several employees in India who were let go. Some affected employees in the country were informed on Tuesday and asked to submit their resignations. Sophos is taking these steps for two main reasons: first, to ensure that we achieve the optimal balance of growth and profitability to support Sophos long-term success, which is particularly important in the midst of a challenging and uncertain macro environment; and second, to allocate our investments across the company to support our strategic imperative to be a market leader in delivering cybersecurity as a service. Sophos told TechCrunch that the layoffs may affect all job roles, but declined to provide further details. Sophos said the plan to cut jobs was to focus more on cybersecurity services, specifically on managed detection and response. This is to achieve its goal of becoming a top player in the global cybersecurity market, the spokesperson said. More than half a million organizations worldwide use Sophos technologies, including endpoint detection and network, email and cloud security, which generate more than $1 billion in revenue, the firm said. Sophos said its managed services business generates over $175 million annually and is growing at over 50% per year. In March 2020, private equity firm Thoma Bravo acquired Sophos in a $3.9 billion deal. We are grateful for the contributions of all our team members, past and present, in building Sophos into a cybersecurity leader, and in helping to keep the world safe from the evils of cybercrime, the spokesperson said. Sophos is joining a growing list of technology companies that have had to lay off their workforce due to financial difficulties. Tech giants including Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have also had to let go of thousands of employees in recent months. Thoma Bravo makes $3.9 billion offer to acquire security firm Sophos"

        "Extracted Article": "SmartNews, a Tokyo-headquartered news aggregation website and app valued at $2 billion as of 2021, today announced a 40% reduction of its U.S. and China workforce, or around 120 people, according to sources familiar with the companys plans. The news was announced on Thursday in an all-hands meeting attended this evening by SmartNews staff. The company confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, saying the current economic conditions were to blame. Impacted roles in the U.S. and China include those in engineering, product and data science, we understand. SmartNews employees in Japan, meanwhile, will soon undergo a voluntary departure program, but they werent yet offered specifics about what that will entail. Laid-off employees will be offered standard severance packages and benefits. In the meeting, staff were told theyd get an email within 15 minutes if they were among those being let go. In total, SmartNews employs nearly 900 people, including its contract workforce, one-third of which work outside Japan. [Update: see more details below above deeper cuts being reported in the U.S.] Sources also told TechCrunch that the company had opted to close its U.S. offices for two days, Thursday and Friday, without giving a reason, which worried employees ahead of the remotely streamed all-hands meeting. This isnt your fault and I am sorry to see you leave, remarked SmartNews CEO Ken Suzuki, when making the announcement. After the announcement was made, the meeting quickly ended, leaving no time for Q&amp;A, frustrating some staff. Founded in 2012 in Japan, the company arrived in the U.S. in 2014 and expanded its local news footprint in early 2020 to cover thousands of U.S. cities. It has relationships with more than 3,000 global publishing partners whose content is available through its service on the web and mobile devices. In its markets, the app grew to become a top news aggregator due to how it personalizes the readers experience using machine learning technology to pick which articles are displayed. In the U.S., it also differentiated itself from others with a News From All Sides feature, which allows users to access news from across a range of political perspectives. In addition, during high-profile events like the COVID-19 pandemic or U.S. elections, SmartNews would offer in-app dashboards that offered critical information at a glance. Image Credits: Sensor Tower The company managed to attract investors, raising more than $400 million since its founding in 2012, despite hefty competition from built-in aggregators like Apple News and Google News, on iOS and Android. In its most recent funding round, a Series F, investors poured in $230 million into the business, valuing it as a double unicorn ($2 billion), the companys press release stated. New investors included U.S.-based Princeville Capital and Woodline Partners, as well as JIC Venture Growth Investments, Green Co-Invest Investment and Yamauchi-No.10 Family Office in Japan. Existing backers ACA Investments and SMBC Venture Capital also participated. The SmartNews app globally reached 30 million monthly active users, with 20 million in Japan and 10 million in the United States, we understand. However, those numbers have been trending down in both markets by around 10-20%, a source said. Since January 2014, SmartNews reached nearly 81 million worldwide installs from across the App Store and Google Play, according to estimates from Sensor Tower. As of 2022, its biggest markets by downloads were Japan (58%) and the U.S. (38%), Sensor Tower said. SmartNews, unfortunately, was impacted by the same macroeconomic factors that have led to a number of tech industry layoffs in recent months, in addition to complications that arose from Apples implementation of App Tracking Transparency, or ATT. The iOS new privacy measure introduced in 2021 hurt companies whose business models relied on advertising, including Meta and Snap, while boosting Apples own ads business. The company could have gone public back in 2019, but leadership pressed for additional funding and a higher valuation. Now that opportunity could be slipping. Reached for comment, SmartNews confirmed the layoffs and offered the following statement: Unfortunately, we are not immune to the current economic conditions that have negatively affected so many businesses. In order to maintain the health of our company and to ensure future growth, we decided to conduct a reorganization that has impacted many of our incredible employees. This was a last resort decision for us, and we hope the severance packages and career transition management services offered to impacted employees will help in their search for a new role. Update, 2/8/23, 4:30 PM ET: SmartNews Layoffs Broaden Although our earlier report had cited staff reductions of around 40%, were now hearing the layoffs have since gone much deeper. Sources at the company, including current and former employees, tell us that SmartNews had somewhere north of 145 employees in the U.S., and now it has only around 60 which means around 85 U.S. employees were laid off. Another source had a slightly different figure of 74 U.S. employees laid off. One source alleged SmartNews has been trying to keep these further cuts quiet, but the impacted staff has included full teams across media and engineering even managers, in some cases. Employees were offered 3 months severance and the package included healthcare. We understand the layoffs in Japan are ongoing, as the company is trying to force voluntary layoffs there. SmartNews declined to comment on these claims saying it had nothing more to share than its original statement (above)."

TechCrunch learned about the layoff that was announced to its employees earlier this week. The startup later confirmed the development over an email. The macroeconomic environment has impacted virtually all businesses, including Greenlight. We recently made the difficult decision to better align our ongoing operating expenses with the current environment, a Greenlight spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The spokesperson said the impacted employees would receive severance, extended medical coverage, and career transition support. The startup announced the decision on Tuesday and now has a workforce of 381 employees. The company remains committed to its mission to help parents raise financially smart kids. Moving into 2023, Greenlight will be focused on continuing to serve its growing customer base and finding new, impactful ways to improve financial literacy for families, the spokesperson said. Greenlight offers kids a debit card, banking app and financial education to make them financially smart and independent. Community Federal Savings Bank issues the Greenlight debit card. In December, the Atlanta-headquartered startup introduced a web-based financial literacy library aligned with the K-12 national standards that will be free to schools, teachers and students. In October, it also added family safety features to its subscription plan called Greenlight Infinity, which is priced at $14.98 per month for the whole family. According to the data available on Crunchbase, Greenlight has raised about $556.5 million in total since its inception in 2014. The funding included the $260 million Series D round that was announced in 2021 at a valuation of $2.3 billion. Greenlight is one of the latest startups to lay off its staff during this challenging time. In the last few days, startups such as Career Karma, Carta and Coinbase let many of their employees go to reduce expenses. Big tech companies, including Amazon and Salesforce, have also laid off thousands of workers this month as the economy continues to struggle. Additionally, the growing economic slowdown has impacted prominent fintech startups, including Stripe, which laid off 14% of its workforce in November. The startup also cut its internal valuation yet again to $63 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier on Thursday."

        "Extracted Article": "Learning navigation platform Career Karma has laid off another 22 people across its global and domestic workforce, less than five months after it cut 60 staff members, according to sources. CEO and co-founder Ruben Harris confirmed the workforce reduction to TechCrunch. The cut shows that even as many edtech companies attempt to right-size their staff, there\u2019s more work to do. Harris\u2019 e-mail to remaining staff underscores the tension of today: Once eager enterprise customers are still making up their minds on whether or not to sign up for new tools, leading to extended sales cycles and uncertainty. \u201cLast year, we made the decision to right-size the company so that we can orient Career Karma toward working with employers and now that we have started to sign customers its clear that we made the right decision,\u201d Harris wrote in the email. \u201cWhat\u2019s unclear is how Fortune 1000 companies will be responding to the macroeconomic environment and its important for us to give ourselves time to work with them to figure that out.\u201d As the market evolves, Career Karmas service of matching employees or professionals to tech bootcamps is being put in a difficult place. Just last month, BloomTech, a coding bootcamp previously known as Lambda School, cut half of staff in pursuit of profitability. During Career Karmas last cut, Harris emphasized that the layoff and its previously-closed $40 million Series B would extend the startups runway to three years. After laying off staff this week, Career Karma now has five years of runway. As TechCrunch has discussed in the past, the strategy of \u201cextending your runway\u201d always comes into vogue whenever investors slow down investing. Career Karma\u2019s shift from the basic three-year rule of thumb to five years shows how that rule may become even more conservative as the downturn continues. Over email, Harris tells TechCrunch that he \u201calways [wants] to have the option to raise \u2026 I just dont want to be forced to raise.\u201d The \u2018ideal runway\u2019 is a myth, isn\u2019t it? With 80 staff now remaining at Career Karma, Harris confirmed that no C-suite executives were impacted by the layoff. Those impacted were offered two months of severance as well as extended benefits. The career navigation platform also, fittingly, offered career navigation support to its new alumni.

        "Extracted Article": "Citizen laid off 33 staff members on Wednesday, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are grateful to all of our departing team members for their contributions to Citizen and are committed to supporting them through this transition with a generous severance package that includes accelerated option vesting and extended exercise window, six months of COBRA payments, career services support and other benefits, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. Citizen did not share what departments at the company were impacted; one laid off employee told TechCrunch that at least 10 engineers were let go. Launched in 2016, the app was initially banned from the App Store over concerns about vigilantism it was called Vigilante at the time. Now, Citizen uses public police blotters to notify users about verified incidents in their area, but users can upload their own reports of suspicious activity and livestream from crime scenes as well. According to data from SensorTower, an app analytics firm, Citizen has seen about $30.3 million in consumer spending and over 14 million downloads since its launch. The private company most recently raised a $73 million Series C funding round in early 2021, which included a $23 million convertible note. Citizen has been criticized for encouraging a culture of surveillance that lends itself to racial profiling and harassment; another neighborhood social app Nextdoor has exhibited similar issues. But the most egregious example of these dangers came from the companys CEO himself. In 2021, Andrew Frame offered Citizen users $30,000 to track down a suspected arsonist while livestreaming on the Citizen app. He shared a photo of the suspect on a live feed which racked up 800,000 views, but it turned out he had the wrong guy. According to a report on the incident from Motherboard, Frame saw this as an elaborate marketing opportunity for the apps livestream feature. \u201cWe deeply regret our mistake and are working to improve our internal processes to prevent this from happening again,\u201d the company wrote in a statement at the time. Later that year, Citizen launched a service called Protect. For $20 per month, users get 24/7 access to a protect agent who can connect them with first responders or police. But critics have questioned whether Citizens alerts stoke panic and fear more than they keep people safe and that fear can encourage people to purchase access to their own personal security agent. According to SensorTower data, in-app purchases on Citizen increased 17% year over year after the introduction of Protect. But Citizen saw an average of $1.4 million in monthly spending on its app in 2022, which likely isnt enough to make the company profitable. Citizen did not share a reason for conducting layoffs, but letting go of 33 employees could afford the company a bit more runway. According to its website, Citizen is currently hiring for five roles.

        "Extracted Article": "Carta, an equity management platform that was last privately valued at $7.4 billion, has cut 10% of its staff, confirming earlier rumors that a workforce reduction was going to happen. Judging by LinkedIn data, the layoff could have impacted around 200 employees. Todays layoff is around the same size as its 2020 workforce reduction, an event that CEO Henry Ward then partially attributed to a decline in new customers given the coronaviruss impact on business. Years later, Ward is striking the same tone. In an email sent to staff today, obtained by TechCrunch, the CEO said that if our customers suffer, so do we. And right now the entire tech and venture ecosystem is suffering. The company claims that it cut costs in travel, vendor spend, marketing spend and investments in new bets, but that it ultimately had to reduce headcount. Severance packages include 2.5 months of severance with one additional week of severance per completed year of service, and extended mental healthcare services. Those who rely on Carta for a visa will get a 30-minute consultation with immigration counsel. Those who were not impacted by the layoff have the option to voluntarily resign, with the option of a severance package. The well-funded company is dealing with more than the macroeconomic conditions that have caused thousands of tech companies to lay off employees. As TechCrunch reported earlier today, Carta is suing its former CTO, Jerry Talton, who was fired \u201cfor cause\u201d almost three weeks ago, on December 23, according to the company. In Carta\u2019s lawsuit, the company references Talton\u2019s \u201cwrongful and illegal acts as an executive of Carta,\u201d including discrimination and the sexual harassment of at least nine women, according to a Carta spokesperson. It doesn\u2019t help that several users of Carta\u2019s services, which range from cap table management to fund administration, have been less than impressed by the platform in the recent months. TechCrunch spoke to a fund manager who was transitioning away from the platform and who claims that his team had four different account managers in a less-than-two-year contract, which \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t help with continuity and understanding of our fund and needs.\u201d According to Crunchbase data, Carta has raised $1.1 billion from venture capital investors, including most recently a $500 million Series G by Silver Lake. Other investors in Carta include Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners. So far, the company says it is used by more than 30,000 companies, over 5,000 investment funds, and half a million employees of its customers. Significant venture backing, as this down market reminds us time and time again, isnt necessarily a competitive advantage. Carta, embroiled in former lawsuits and now taking on a current challenge, has thus perhaps unsurprisingly attracted a wide swath of competition in recent years. Its closest competitor, AngelList Venture, has raised dramatically less capital, around $200 million. When TechCrunch asked AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli about recent product changes that put it square in competition with Carta, he shrugged \u2014 adding that he has nothing new to add. \u201cUltimately, there\u2019s going to be a small number of folks who actually have the ability to build a calculated product,\u201d Kohli said in a previous interview. \u201cWhen I say ability, I don\u2019t mean technical abilities, but the institutional knowledge to build something.\u201d The difficulty of building a company in the venture services landscape was only further proved by the recent shutdown of Assure, a fintech company that helped investors issue special-purpose vehicles. According to Axios, Assure didn\u2019t give investors any reasoning behind its shutdown beyond the following statement: The industry has evolved considerably over the decade since we founded our company. Current market conditions have resulted in Assure evaluating its business model. Let\u2019s see if the industry\u2019s evolution, both with more competition and graveyard companies, is a dynamic that Carta can keep up with.

        "Extracted Article": "The continuing onslaught of tech layoffs has not let up in the new year. Last week, we saw big layoff announcements from Amazon and Salesforce with thousands of employees being let go. Yesterday CRN reported that Cloud Software Group was undertaking massive layoffs. Today the company confirmed it was laying off 15% of the workforce. Although the company would not share just how many people were involved, it appears to be in the thousands. Cloud Software Group was formed last year after PE firms Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital (an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management) took Citrix private in a $16.5 billion deal, the third biggest enterprise M&amp;A deal of last year. At the time, the firms indicated they would be combining Citrix with Tibco, another enterprise firm that Vista had purchased previously. In a post published today from CEO Tom Krause, who was put in charge when the combined company was formed, he confirmed that layoffs had indeed happened. \u201cYesterday, we notified roughly 15% of the total Cloud Software Group workforce that their roles have been eliminated or made redundant as part of our planning process for the new company,\u201d he said, not pulling any punches. Krause wrote that layoffs are among the toughest decisions any executive has to make, and he acknowledged the pain that comes with these moves. \u201cPlease know that these decisions were not taken lightly. Rather, they were practical business decisions designed to strengthen the combined companies,\u201d he wrote. When Vista and Elliott announced that they were acquiring Citrix for such a hefty amount, and combining the two companies, it seemed likely that cost-cutting would follow. At the time, Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller expected as much when he told TechCrunch: \u201cThe combo has a lot of assets to play with on the tech side, especially with Citrix\u2019s virtualization and the future of work. But it will be all about execution, and we will see in a few months if Vista and Elliott are undertaking a go-forward and growth strategy, or if they will save costs and \u2018milk\u2019 the install base. The high price tag will make the latter strategy hard to lay off, but perhaps with some asset sales, it could work well,\u201d Mueller said. It\u2019s worth noting that Krause said that in addition to eliminating duplicate positions across the two companies, it would be looking at top customers and aligning the product roadmap to meet those customers, so it seems its looking at the installed base that Mueller alluded to. But each of those jobs, redundant or not from a business perspective, was held by an individual who is out of work today, and they join the thousands of other tech workers who have been laid off in recent months. If there is any silver lining to be found here, multiple reports have stated over the last several months that laid off tech workers are quickly finding work."

These sorts of things take a lot of time and money, of course \u2014 and these days it seems increasingly difficult to find either. Today, the California-based firm announced that it is \u201cdecelerating\u201d work on the Mojo Lens, citing, \u201csignificant challenges in raising capital.\u201d In an announcement posted to it site, CEO Drew Perkins blames insurmountable headwinds, including the bad economy and the yet-to-be proven market potential for advanced AR products in its ability to raise the necessary funding required to keep the project afloat. \u201cAlthough we haven\u2019t had the chance yet to see it ship and to reach its full potential in the marketplace, we have proven that what was once considered science fiction can be developed into a technical reality,\u201d Perkins writes. \u201cEven though the pursuit of our vision for Invisible Computing is on hold for now, we strongly believe that there will be a future market for Mojo Lens and expect to accelerate it when the time is right.\u201d Instead of focusing on Lens, Mojo is focusing its resources on the micro-LED technology that powers it. The company had developed a 14,000 ppi micro-LED display as the product\u2019s foundation. \u201cWe believe micro-LED will disrupt the entire $160 billion display industry and our unique technology puts us at the forefront of this disruption,\u201d Perkins adds. Along with the pivot, the company has also made a dramatic cut to head count, reducing its staff by 75%. The lays will impact roles and divisions across the startup. The companys most recent funding round was a $45 million Series B-1 announced a year ago tomorrow. The company declined further comment."

        "Extracted Article": "Update: CEO Cheng Lu said laid off workers will remain on the payroll for two months and will receive severance. Well, we knew it was coming. Self-driving trucking technology company TuSimple confirmed Wednesday it plans to lay off 25% of its total workforce as part of a broader restructuring plan designed to keep the company running. The layoffs come a couple of weeks after TuSimple and Navistar ended their deal to co-develop purpose-built autonomous semi trucks. The staff reductions, which we estimate to affect around 350 workers, also follow a rough year for the company, including a series of executive shakeups, multiple federal investigations, a truck crash and a plummeting stock price. Like many other companies exploring pioneer technology, TuSimple has struggled to make up enough revenue to cover its cash burn. Its no secret that the current economic environment is difficult. We must be prudent with our capital and operate as efficiently as possible, said Cheng Lu, TuSimples president and CEO, in a statement. Lu recently re-joined the company as CEO after he was ousted earlier this year. His predecessor and TuSimple\u2019s founder Xiaodi Hou was fired following an internal probe that showed certain employees having ties and sharing confidential information with Hydron, a China-backed hydrogen-powered trucking company. While I deeply regret the impact this has on those affected, I believe it is a necessary step as TuSimple continues down our path to commercialization. This is part of our overall strategy to prioritize investments that bring the most value to shareholders, and position TuSimple as a customer-focused, product-driven organization. TuSimple is in the process of selling off its Asia-focused business, so the layoffs are only affecting staff in the U.S. TuSimple has workers in San Diego, Arizona and Texas. Its not yet clear which teams were affected or if the layoffs will hit a specific region, although one deep perception engineer in Los Angeles has already posted on LinkedIn about being cut. About 80% of the remaining staff are in research and development and are responsible for working in hardware and software resilience, reliability, safety and information security, TuSimple said in a statement. The company is scaling back freight expansion, including unprofitable freight lanes and respective trucking operations that still rely on previous generations of autonomous software, which TuSimple says provides limited value to its ongoing technology development. The focus now is on validating and commercializing its autonomous trucking technology by working with shipping partners, the company said. TuSimple had previously received around 7,000 reservations for its Navistar trucks with customers like DHL Supply Chain, Schneider and U.S. Xpress. Its not clear if any of those partnerships remain, or if TuSimple will have to shop around again. A source familiar with the matter recently told TechCrunch TuSimple would find another truck-maker to work with in the future. The restructure will cost TuSimple about $10 million to $11 million, a line item thatll show up on Q4s balance sheet and be paid in the first quarter of 2023. TuSimple estimates itll save $55 million to $65 million on an annual basis as a result of the layoffs and restructuring. At the time of publishing, TuSimple is trading at $1.42, which is down nearly 6% today and 96% year-to-date. Employees will remain on the payroll for two months, as required under the WARN Act, and TuSimple plans to offer severance on top of that, Lu told TechCrunch."

The personnel change comes about a month after the company internally announced that its CFO would be leaving at the end of the year for personal reasons, and just months after the Tiger Global\u2013backed company was rumored to be going public. But, as IPO season continues to be frigid, the not-yet-profitable business has clearly opted to make cuts ahead of any 2023 movement. Sources say the restructuring could be the companys attempt to look more profitable ahead of an anticipated public market debut. TechCrunch reached out to Komodo Health for comment but did not yet hear back at time of publication. The company did, however, confirm the layoffs in a LinkedIn post. Co-founders Arif Nathoo and Web Sun wrote a memo to staff, obtained by TechCrunch, which describes the layoffs as part of a broader restructuring as the world changes \u201cagain.\u201d \u201cWe believe that this is the beginning of a change that may last for many more months, if not years,\u201d the co-founders wrote in the email, sent to all full-time employees. \u201cWe have always prided ourselves on running a capital efficient business, and today we\u2019re taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned for the current world around us.\u201d Axios last reported that Komodo\u2019s ARR, as of March, was around $150 million; investors, meanwhile, valued the company at $3.3 billion during its last funding round, a $220 million Series E announced in March 2021. After the email was sent, Komodo Health\u2019s co-founders also held a meeting with remaining employees, adding that the company has closed a structured equity infusion from Dragoneer and Coatue for around $200 million, sources said. The co-founders also stressed that the layoff was meant be one and done. It is unclear whether this round was raised at the same valuation of its March 2021 round. Komodo Health is joining a number of late-stage companies that have announced workforce reductions in the final innings of the year, including Stripe, Plaid and Airtable. It conducted a previous round of layoffs in April 2020, just months after raising a $50 million round from Andreessen Horowitz.

        "Extracted Article": "Welcome to Startups Weekly, a nuanced take on this week\u2019s startup news and trends by Senior Reporter and Equity co-host Natasha Mascarenhas. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. Outschool laid off a quarter of staff, or 43 people, earlier this week, according to an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch. The edtech company, last valued at $3 billion, confirmed the layoffs over email, citing a focus on core capabilities as \u201cgrowth has come back down to earth.\u201d The e-mail sent to staff was even more direct. \u201cThe truth is the layoffs in our sector are widespread for a reason,\u201d Amir Nathoo, the co-founder of edtech unicorn Outschool, wrote in an email sent to staff. \u201cThe funding atmosphere has been dramatically impacted by the anticipation of a recession, higher interest rates and an increased need to show [return on investment] to investors.\u201d To employees, Nathoo\u2019s tone is reminiscent of a conversation he had just months earlier, in July, when the entrepreneur had to run Outschool through its first round of layoffs, which impacted 18% of staff. The entrepreneur\u2019s comments underscore how some of edtech\u2019s boldest and well capitalized companies are struggling. For example, Outschool\u2019s double round of layoffs comes after it raised a Series B, C and D in 12 months and grew its valuation from $1 billion to $3 billion in an even shorter period. As part of this week\u2019s layoff, Outschool co-founder and head of product Nick Grandy is also leaving the company. \u201cI understood that our growth would slow down once learners were able to be back in school full time; however I didn\u2019t anticipate that our growth would slow as dramatically as it has,\u201d Nathoo wrote in the e-mail. \u201cThis is on me and I want to sincerely apologize.\u201d In the last quarter of 2022, edtech layoffs have hit venture-backed businesses including but not limited to BloomTech, Vedantu, Teachmint, Reforge, Coursera, Unacademy, Byju\u2019s, Udacity and Brainly. Executive shifts include Quizlet CEO stepping down, Degreed\u2019s CEO stepping aside for the founder\u2019s return, and Invact Metaversity\u2019s co-founder leaving after irreconcilable differences with his co-founder. Class, an edtech company that neared unicorn status only 10 months after launching its Zoom School alternative, also conducted layoffs this year. The company raised a total of $146 million in known venture funding to date, including a SoftBank Vision Fund II check. CEO and founder Michael Chasen did not respond to a request for comment Coding bootcamp BloomTech, formerly known as Lambda School, cut half of staff last week, in its third known round of layoffs since the pandemic began. Unlike Outschool and Class, BloomTech wasn\u2019t on a rapid fundraising spree throughout the pandemic. Instead, the reasoning for layoffs seems to be a bit more ambiguous \u2014 with CEO Austen Allred only explaining the decision by saying that \u201cwe had to cut costs to become profitable.\u201d We now know that the startups that most enjoyed a pandemic-era boom are now the same startups facing difficult questions about how to navigate a not-so-looming downturn. But edtech is a sector that rose to an entirely different stratosphere in 2020 and 2021, as the demand for remote learning skyrocketed. As demand grew, so did investor appetite. The same venture capital rounds that allowed companies to expand their idea of what a total addressable market could look like, are the same tranches that may have forced an overspending and overhiring spree that now requires a correction. Unlike a sector like crypto, which experienced a similar bull run and is now handling a winter of its own, edtech\u2019s explosion touched on uniquely human and non-techie needs. In Outschool\u2019s case, it\u2019s now pivoting to focus more on the tutoring end of its platform to combat the learning loss coming out of COVID-19. It\u2019s safe to say that the sector is shifting from a disruptive mood to maintenance mode. But let\u2019s pause our edtech digging and move on to other happenings from this week in tech. You can find me on Twitter, Substack and Instagram, where I publish more of my words and work. In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll talk about Airtable, Plaid and all your darn AI avatars. Airtable and Plaid We\u2019ll stop talking about layoffs after this section, but there were two cuts this week that truly surprised me: Plaid laid off 20% of staff and, well, so did Airtable. This comes after a long string of layoffs in the fintech space, not limited to but including Chime, Stripe and Opendoor. Here\u2019s why this is important: Both of these startups were hiring and touted as a place for laid-off talent to apply as recently as two weeks ago. All to say, there is so much whiplash out there for job seekers, especially those laid off, around where they can trust for their next gig. I do wonder why these late-stage companies waited so long to conduct layoffs, or if they truly thought they\u2019d be able to ride through this downturn with high expenses. What changed to make them finally pull the plug? Note that Airtable\u2019s layoff seems to be especially sweeping \u2014 seeing that its chief product officer, chief people officer and chief revenue officer are also parting ways with the company as it pivots to focus more on the enterprise side of its business. Were you laid off? I am writing a story about where tech talent goes from here, and I\u2019d love to chat (off the record is totally fine!). DM me on Twitter or Signal me at (925) 271 0912.

Jokes aside, if you have been on tech Twitter at all during the last few weeks, you\u2019ve probably seen some pretty sleek, imaginative algorithmically generated portraits of your friends (and nemeses). The company behind these magic avatars is Lensa AI, which has unsurprisingly been climbing up the app store. It\u2019s damn cool. Yes, I\u2019m tempted. But, not to rain all over your new Twitter pictures, there are already questions about how it\u2019s being used and its impact on artists. Here\u2019s why this is important via my colleague, Taylor Hatmaker: While the tech world has celebrated the advancements of AI image and text generators this year \u2014 and artists have watched the proceedings warily \u2014 your average Instagram user probably hasn\u2019t struck up a philosophical conversation with ChatGPT or fed DALL-E absurdist prompts. That also means that most people haven\u2019t grappled with the ethical implications of free, readily available AI tools like Stable Diffusion and how they\u2019re poised to change entire industries \u2014 if we let them. I strongly urge you to read Hatmaker\u2019s piece to understand some of Lensa\u2019s red flags, especially if you care about artists being appropriately credited and paid for their work and, well, the future of creation.

        "Extracted Article": "Primer, a U.K. startup founded by alums of Braintree and PayPal that provides a drag-and-drop framework for merchants to build online payment stacks, last year raised $50 million at a $425 million valuation from investors like ICONIQ, Accel, Balderton Capital and Seedcamp a round the came amid a bullish period for e-commerce, with record-levels of buying activity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, that activity has cooled down, and so have things at this e-commerce startup. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Primer has cut a big swathe of its staff as part of a restructuring, as it looks to adjust to current market conditions and extend its runway amid what many believe will be a tough year ahead. Sources tell us that some 85 staff have been let go around one-third of the company, we understand. We can confirm that we did have a reduction in staff, a spokesperson said. Like many other firms right now, we have course-corrected heading into the new year given the economic environment and we have taken what we think are appropriate steps to account for the uncertain times ahead. The story of what is going on here bears spelling out because the same thing is likely hitting a number of startups (and bigger companies) in the industry. The long and short of it is that the wider e-commerce market has seen a major drop in activity this year as the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic or at least the acute response that involved masking, social distancing and staying away from crowded physical spaces has subsided. That activity was not what many had predicted: Many had presumed that after large numbers of people had shifted to buying online, they would never go back to the old way of doing things. That hasnt played out: People are going back to shopping in stores, but more importantly, the global economy has cooled down, inflation has gone up and people are spending less. So companies that expanded to meet demand are now retrenching. That has led to layoffs and restructuring even at some of the very biggest companies in the space that you might have thought would be best equipped to handle economic ups and downs. Amazon, for example, warned in its last quarterly earnings that sales would be lower than originally expected in the critical holiday period. It has been cutting thousands of employees and rationalizing some of its most costly product areas. You may have recently seen that some of the gloomiest predictions were not borne out during the bellwether Black Friday and subsequent first weekend of holiday sales. But a good part of that activity has been attributed to retailers offering large discounts to spur buying, so margins will be hit longer term. This is not just playing out at the larger end of the retail market smaller sellers and the many providers of tech to the industry will also be feeling the drop. Primers unique selling point is that it has built a very simple, no-code interface that reduces what is usually a very complicated, fragmented process building a payments stack and flow around online purchasing, which includes not just the basic transaction but potentially different payment options, adding loyalty or discount codes, upselling to other products, managing customer information, verifying against fraud and much more into a set of drag and drop boxes for its customers both to call in more features and visualize how they would work together. It offers integrations for dozens of different services, underscoring just how fragmented the space is. \u201cWe are building out a whole suite in the next year to aid merchants with operations and the observability of the payment stack,\u201d said Paul Anthony, Prime\u2019s co-founder and CEO, in an interview with TechCrunch last year. However, a source tells us that while the process was seamless to order up, implementing it was not quite as automatic and quick. They are signing merchants but getting them live is a long process, they said. They do not generate revenue until they are live. Hence, they reduced teams until they solve this bottleneck. Given the pressures many startups are seeing with fundraising right now, the first thing to do is not to raise more money to extend runway, but to cut costs to extend what you already have in the bank, and thats what Primer has done here. Sources tell us that Primers aim with this restructuring is to extend its runway to more than two years (which it believes it has done). Its plan now is to continue investing in product with expansions on that front planned for next year. As in any downturn, there is an argument to be made for more automation in any process to cut down costs and especially in the case of e-commerce put more efficient tech in place to speed up and close more sales. But that only stands if the tech is up to the challenge, and if target customers are in a position to invest in improvements themselves. Thats the opportunity but also curse of working in any ecosystem. Primers aim is to come out as one of the helpers (and winners) in that process. Given the challenging economic environment, we believe Primer is more valuable to merchants and partners than ever before as they look to increase efficiency within their organisations, lower costs, build greater customer loyalty, and launch in new markets and do this in a no-code/automated fashion, the spokesperson said. While these are always difficult decisions to make, we feel confident this recalibration will not affect the level of service we offer to our current and prospective merchants and partners."

        "Extracted Article": "Brodmann17, an Israeli computer vision technology startup that developed a novel approach to take on a marketplace dominated by Mobileye, shut down this week. Brodmann17s co-founder and CEO Adi Pinhas posted a message on LinkedIn announcing the move, stating that while the company would not be able to bring its products to the mass market as hoped, we do get comfort that our innovation will hopefully influence the market thinking and others will proceed in the mission of creating safer mobility to everyone. In a subsequent interview, Pinhas told TechCrunch that there is a strong feeling of sorrow as we proved the technology, there is outstanding demand and we have customers in production. Brodmann17, named after the primary visual cortex in the human brain, was launched six years ago by Pinhas, a deep learning and computer vision specialist, and AI scientists Amir Alush and Assaf Mushinsky. The trio focused their efforts on developing a new approach to computer vision technology designed to support advanced driver assistance systems. Computer vision systems are considered a critical component to automated driving features. This multibillion-dollar market promises to only get bigger as automakers shift away from its autonomous vehicle goals and instead toward near-term revenue products like advanced driver assistance systems. Brodmann17 knew it couldnt compete with Mobileye on its front-facing camera unless it could bring a new angle to the tech, Pinhas said. So we focused on the blue ocean, he added. That blue ocean was to develop deep learning-based computer vision technology that isnt reliant on bulky hardware. This lightweight software-based product was able to run on low-end processors in the car itself and was designed to complement sensors like cameras, radar and even lidar already on the vehicle. Brodmann17 applied its technology to blind-spot wing cameras, surround and rear cameras, video telematics and even two wheelers, Pinhas said. The demand in the market is far more diversified than people think, he said. We decided to take the road not taken by many other companies in the ecosystem. We just needed more time. The startup did attract investors during its lifetime. Brodmann17 raised $11 million in a Series A round back in 2019 that was led by OurCrowd. Maniv Mobility, AI Alliance, UL Ventures, Samsung NEXT and the Sony Innovation Fund also participated. Brodmann17 nabs $11M for its automotive computer vision tech that runs on any CPU But the company struggled to get new funding. Even though the team was very lean, with fewer than 30 people, Pinhas said it was impossible to continue without support from private and corporate venture capital firms. He added that everyone is waiting for next year and for something to happen before making more investments. Brodmann17 did attract some interest as a possible acquisition target. There were several offers, but all of those fell through, due mostly to timing reasons, he added. Despite the gloomy news, Pinhas said he is ready for another project. I love deep tech and creating new products, he said, without elaborating on what he might focus. Life is too short for a break."

        "Extracted Article": "Just days ago, Airtable published a memo about how laid off workers can use Airtable to search for jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s been an unwelcome theme of 2022\u2014layoffs,\u201d the post said. \u201cEach season seems to usher in a new wave of cuts. Meanwhile, corporations cite similar concerns of rising inflation, the looming threat of an economic downturn and the need for stability during turbulent times. For the souls who lost their jobs this year it\u2019s another cruel uncertainty they\u2019ll have to surmount.\u201d Airtable chief revenue officer, chief people officer and chief product officer are out Now, Airtable\u2019s employees are facing the same feeling. Last valued at $11 billion, the no-code leader has conducted a round of layoffs today that impact around 254 employees across business development, engineering and other teams. The company spokesperson says that Airtable is continuing to hire for strategically important roles, and that 20% of the staff was impacted today. (Update: The layoff was announced internally alongside an executive departure. Airtables chief revenue officer, chief people officer and chief product officer have all parted ways with the company, effective today, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch.) Those impacted by Airtable\u2019s layoffs today will get at least 16 weeks of severance pay, accelerated equity vesting and, for those on a visa, support from an immigration counsel, sources say. Employees were given the opportunity to meet 1:1 with a leader at the company, following the news. In an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch, and first seen by tracker Layoffs.fyi, Airtable founder and CEO Howie Liu said the company will be evolving from a bottoms-up adopted product to a company that brings connected apps to larger enterprises. \u201cWe\u2019ve rapidly expanded and executed on multiple fronts. At the time, I believed we could successfully pursue all of them in parallel,\u201d Liu wrote in the email. \u201cHowever, in taking a hard look at our efforts in the current market environment, we\u2019ve identified the teams best positioned to capture the opportunity in enterprise in order to bring complete focus, alignment and accountability in our execution.\u201d The vision was part of the reason that TechCrunch spoke to Liu in October, as Airtable announced its more integrated, connected-apps approach. Then, the entrepreneur pointed to its $735 million Series F round from 2021 as a fortunate reason that Airtable has been able to stay well-capitalized amid the downturn. \u201cWe have more than enough runway to get to profitability and then some,\u201d Liu said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re a private company, so we\u2019re not under the gun to show short-term results of profitability so we\u2019re very, very fortunate to not be under so much pressure and we would never gloat about that, but I do think it gives us a unique position [to hire talent]. In todays internal memo, Liu re-emphasized that Airtable is well capitalized, but slightly shifted in tone by adding that being a lean organization becomes doubly important in times of economic uncertainty. A spokesperson added that all of Airtables funds from its Series F are still intact. The company is signaling that the layoff was less of a desperate attempt to extend runway, and more of a move made in order to re-align the company with what actually works. A spokesperson said that its enterprise side, which makes up the majority of Airtables revenue, is growing more than 100% year over year; the product move today just doubles down on that exact cohort. This entire year was full of tech layoffs, but the final quarter has been especially massive as macroeconomic pressure reaches late-stage private companies. Yesterday, Plaid announced that it would officially cut 20% of staff, around a month after one of the most valuable fintechs, Stripe, cut 14% of its workforce. Elon Musk cut around 50% of Twitter\u2019s workforce after he bought the social media platform, one of the largest layoffs percentage-wise that has happened since the beginning of the pandemic. Like others, Airtable is assuming a leaner, more focused business strategy to head into the new year.

        "Extracted Article": "Fintech decacorn Plaid is laying off 260 employees, or about 20% of its workforce, the company announced today. While specific details around who exactly was affected remain unknown, sources in recent months had told TechCrunch that the San Francisco-based startup\u2019s engineering team was likely to take a big hit. In March, Plaid CTO Jean-Denis Greze told TechCrunch that he grew his engineering team 17.5x in just four years, from 20 engineers to 350 people. Today\u2019s cut likely reverses some of that hyper-growth. A company spokesperson did not disclose how many engineers are being impacted, saying teams across the company were affected. She added that since Plaid is \u201caligning to updated headcount goals, teams like recruiting are impacted more than others.\u201d In a letter to employees that was posted on Plaid\u2019s website, CEO and co-founder Zach Perret said the company saw a rapid increase in usage by its existing customers, a large number of new customers and \u201csubstantial revenue acceleration\u201d during COVID. As such, the company \u201chired aggressively\u201d to meet customer demand and invest in new products. However, macroeconomic shifts resulted in Plaid customers experiencing slower-than-expected growth, causing the company to backpedal. The simple reality is that due to these macroeconomic changes, our pace of cost growth outstripped our pace of revenue growth. I made the decision to hire and invest ahead of revenue growth, and the current economic slowdown has meant that this revenue growth did not materialize as quickly as expected. All impacted employees will get 16 weeks of base pay in severance. Those who have been with Plaid for more than one year will get additional weeks. Plaid will also be paying the cash equivalent of six months of healthcare premiums for medical, dental and vision insurance coverage for employees and their dependents. In a practice that is becoming increasingly common, the company is also accelerating equity grants for employees who worked at the company for more than one year to the February 15, 2023 vesting date. It is also waiving the one-year cliff for workers with equity who havent yet reached their one-year vesting cliff. Additionally, it says it will provide six months of career support and coaching services as well as six months of continued mental health coverage for all departing employees. The company also says it has \u201cdedicated immigration counsel\u201d for those on a work visa. Affected employees lost access to many Plaid systems in a move that Perret acknowledged may seem \u201cabrupt\u201d but that he deemed necessary \u201cgiven the sensitive nature of data\u201d in its industry. In April of 2021, Plaid raised a $425 million Series D led by Altimeter Capital, which valued the company at around $13.4 billion. This was after its deal to be acquired by Visa for $5.3 billion fell through due to regulatory concerns. A lot has happened since that lofty valuation and Plaid is now directly competing with one of its partners, payments giant Stripe which recently conducted layoffs of its own, letting go of more than 1,100 people. Earlier this year, Stripe announced a new product called Financial Connections, which gives Stripe\u2019s customers a way to connect directly to their customer\u2019s bank accounts, to access financial data to speed up or run certain kinds of transactions. Sound familiar? Then two weeks later, Plaid announced it was officially expanding from its core product of account linking \u2014 its first major expansion since its 2013 inception. Specifically, the startup said it was moving into identity and income verification, fraud prevention and providing new tools for account funding and disbursements a move that put it into even deeper competition with Stripe. For its part, Stripe was last valued at $95 billion when it closed on a $600 million funding round in March of 2021. More recently, Plaid announced that it had named Meta veteran John Anderson to serve as its new head of payments as it began personally facilitating payments through its Transfer offering, in addition to facilitating its partners\u2019 payments. Plaid\u2019s layoff comes amid an especially tumultuous year for fintech startups. Besides Stripe, neobank Chime recently laid off 12% of its staff, or some 160 workers.

        "Extracted Article": "Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company valued at $2.2 billion last year, has laid off a portion of its workforce. Yesterday, a few affected and non-affected employees took to LinkedIn to reveal the news. TechCrunch has learned from sources that more than 50 employees were affected across multiple departments; the engineering team took the biggest hit, with around 60% of those laid off coming from the department, according to people familiar with the matter. This morning a significant amount of Chipper staff were let go in a layoff. While I was not among them, many of my close colleagues and friends were. If youre looking for talented engineering leadership, engineers, technical program managers, analysts, or IT staff, Erin Fusaro, the VP of Engineering at Chipper Cash said in her LinkedIn post. Per LinkedIn, Chipper Cash has about 400 employees, so the layoffs affected 12.5% of its workforce. TechCrunch reached out to Chipper Cash for comment. Last November, the African cross-border payments company raised $150 million in a Series C extension round led by Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX. The investment came barely six months after Chipper Cash closed its first Series C round of $100 million, led by SVB Capital, the corporate venture capital arm of SVB Financial Group. Since its inception, Chipper Cash has raised more than $305 million from investors, including Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital and Bezos Expeditions. FTX processed billions monthly in Africa before going bust CEO Ham Serunjogi founded Chipper Cash with Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer a no-fee peer-to-peer cross-border payment service in Africa via its app. Its services are used across seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. The company began making strides outside the continent last year. It expanded to the U.K. allowing people to send money from the European nation to Chipper Cash\u2019s African markets and the U.S. to facilitate peer-to-peer money movement from the U.S. to Nigeria and Uganda. Chipper Cash says it has 5 million users across these markets. Layoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations. Economic headwinds have hit the global fintech space hard. Companies such as Stripe and Klarna have had to lay off employees and prune their valuations. While there have been whispers of African unicorns slashing valuations internally, only half of this trend has publicly manifested itself so far within this select group. This June, Wave, an African unicorn that offers mobile money services in part of Francophone Africa, laid off about 15% of its workforce. Chipper Cash has joined the fray with this news. SWVL, 54gene, Sendy and Twiga are examples of mid-to-large-sized companies on the continent that have also trimmed their workforce. 54gene valuation slashed by over $100M amid job cuts and CEO exit SWVL reduces its headcount by 50% six months after axing 400+ staff If you want to contact us with a story tip, you can do so securely here."

        "Extracted Article": "Lora DiCarlo, a sex tech startup that made headlines in 2019 after being blacklisted from the Consumer Electronics Show, seems to have shut down. The companys website is offline and reportedly orders have gone unfulfilled for months. TechCrunch has reached out to the eponymous founder for confirmation, but it sure looks like the end of the line for a briefly promising high-tech sex toy enterprise. Founded in 2017, Lora DiCarlo was one of a new wave of tech-forward sexual health companies headed up by women. It won an innovation award at CES 2019 for, as our writer put it at the time, a hands-free device that uses biomimicry and robotics to help women achieve a blended orgasm by simultaneously stimulating the G-spot and the clitoris. But then the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, withdrew the award and banned the company from exhibiting at the show. Their explanation at the time was that neither the company nor its devices fit a product category. Predictably, this attracted immediate blowback and allegations of sexism, prudery and generally bad judgment. Everyone was on Lora DiCarlos side, and the publicity was invaluable, she later told TechCrunch at Disrupt: I think they actually did us a pretty big favor. The company raised $2 million around that time, and about $9 million total over its five years of operation. But despite a big return to the show in 2020 (and a coveted TC+ feature, of course), the company seems to have faltered during the pandemic \u2014 perhaps falling victim to the same chip shortages and manufacturing problems even established hardware makers encountered. A sex tech startup\u2019s triumphant return to CES As chronicled by Womens Health, the last few months seem to have been Lora DiCarlos last, as various aspects of a functioning commercial enterprise began to fail: orders werent going out, stock was gone at retail partners and personnel have left. The site went down earlier this month and is down still. Although there has not been any official announcement, it certainly does seem that the company is kaput. Its too bad, but finding success as a hardware startup is hard enough without a pandemic and the stigma on sex toys adding drag. Well update this article if we hear back from DiCarlo."

        "Extracted Article": "A little over a year after buzzy coding bootcamp Lambda School rebranded as Bloom Institute of Technology, the venture-backed startup is conducting massive layoffs, according to sources. The workforce reduction, per people familiar with the matter, has impacted half of the companys staff across content, product, data and engineering teams. The layoff is expected to have impacted around 88 employees, using metrics provided in BloomTechs 2022 diversity report metrics. Employees were called into an All Hands meeting this morning in which BloomTech CEO Austen Allred notified staff of the impending layoffs. After the meeting, those impacted were notified via e-mail. According to documents seen by TechCrunch, employees will get normal pay and medical benefits until January 31, 2023 and are expected to work through that period. Those laid off were also offered optional time with managers to talk. This is the company\u2019s third round of known layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic began. During BloomTech\u2019s last big layoff, in April 2021, Allred admitted that it\u2019s been difficult to make his for-profit company\u2019s vision of \u201cincentive-aligned education work.\u201d In a now-deleted tweet posted earlier today, Allred quoted a prior statement of gratitude for employees pushing through the work despite being attacked from all sides, adding \u201ceven more so today.\u201d The name change to BloomTech appeared to be part of the companys attempt to get things back on track. At the time, the startup updated its tuition payment options to introduce an outcomes-based loan. The financing instrument allows students to take a loan with zero dollars upfront, and then get 110% of their tuition refunded, including fees and interest from an approved lender, if they are unable to secure a job in web development or computer science within the next year. At the time, the move meant that BloomTech was expanding beyond the original vision of scaling income-sharing agreements (ISAs), the controversial financing vehicle that it helped pioneer. ISAs, which are used between 90% to 100% of students within BloomTech\u2019s cohorts, will continue to be offered as an option, with some changes. Fast-forward to today, and the current state of the tech labor market doesn\u2019t make BloomTech\u2019s mission any easier. The widespread layoffs within tech companies have unlocked a massive market of trained professionals looking for their next gig; all potential competition for BloomTech graduates hoping to stand out against ex-Twitter and ex-Stripe employees. Career Karma, a platform that helps connect students to coding bootcamps, cut staff this year, while Flockjay pivoted away from its bootcamp pitch in 2021. Market uncertainty is certainly one factor that impacts outcomes, but BloomTech has also been embroiled in a number of lawsuits over the past few years led by students who claim to have been misled by the institution. BloomTechs pitch is that it can help students land tech jobs, but questions have arisen about what happens when students get jobs after graduating from BloomTechs program that are unrelated to their studies there, and whether they still owe the company a share of their resulting income. These tensions have grown over the years. Most recently, reports one education publication, a student accused BloomTech of intentionally misrepresenting its job placement rates. Last year, leaked documents obtained by Business Insider raised questions about the company inflating its efficacy and hyping up a curriculum that didn\u2019t upskill folks at the level expected. Allred responded to request for comment days after publication, saying that BloomTechs employees are fantastic. We had to cut costs to become profitable. You should hire them."

        "Extracted Article": "Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture developing autonomous vehicle technology, cut its workforce this week \u2014 the latest example of layoffs in the AV industry and more broadly in the tech sector. Employees were told of the layoffs Wednesday, according to sources who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak for the company. Motional, which employs more than 1,500 people globally, confirmed the layoffs. Motional did not confirm the number of employees affected. Sources said dozens of employees were laid off with cuts happening across its operations. Motional has offices in Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, South Korea, Singapore and several cities in California, including Milpitas and Santa Monica. Motional recently announced steps to reallocate resources to areas of the company that will help ensure long-term commercial success, a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. As the organization evolves, we will continue to hire the critical talent needed to develop our technology and meet our commitments to our partners. With our recent partnership announcements and the achievement of technology milestones, we are confident this shift will position us for a strong future. The company said it is providing severance packages and outplacement support to help in their transition. Layoffs have become commonplace in the tech industry this year. The autonomous vehicle sector has been especially hard hit as the high development costs and lack of revenue \u2014 never mind profits \u2014 has left companies with dwindling cash. Investors, once ready to plow money into this frontier tech, are now looking for safer, nearer term bets. In November, AV delivery startup Nuro laid off about 300 people, or 20% of its workforce, in an effort to preserve cash amid a stormy economic outlook. Argo AI, the AV startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen, also laid off employees earlier this summer. Several months later, Argo abruptly shut down after its two backers declined to invest more capital into the enterprise and shift its resources to advanced driver assistance systems. While Motional didnt provide a reason for its reallocation of resources, other AV companies have cited uncertain economic conditions as well as over-hiring in 2021 as a primary reason. Even AV companies that have yet to lay off employees are feeling pressure to cut costs. Aurora Innovation, a startup-turn-SPAC, presented a swath of cost-cutting and cash-generating options to its board earlier this year, ranging from a hiring freeze and spinning out assets to a small capital raise, going private and even selling itself to high-profile tech companies Apple and Microsoft. Motional, like many of its remaining AV competitors, has focused its commercialization efforts on launching robotaxi services. The company sees partnerships as a key piece of its go-to-market strategy and has agreements with Lyft, Uber and Via."

        "Extracted Article": "Lyst, the U.K. fashion e-commerce site that last year raised funding at a $700 million valuation, is the latest tech startup to rein in spending by cutting staff. TechCrunch has learned that the company is in the process of laying off 25% of its employees, working out to about 50 people, as part of a larger restructuring to conserve cash flow and move to profitability. The details were first leaked to us by way of an internal memo from the CEO, Emma McFerran, who took over the role of CEO from founder Chris Morton in July of this year. The company then confirmed the details to us. Its not clear which departments will be most impacted, but the memo notes that some 85 people are being contacted who will be impacted by this exercise. We understand from sources that the company had plans for an IPO next year but that these are now being pushed back, and that it might be looking for another round of funding to shore up its finances. Lyst last raised money in May 2021, when the picture for e-commerce was rosily tinted, one of the ironic bright business spots in the largely otherwise devastating COVID-19 pandemic: fashion retailers in particular were seeing record-breaking revenues and business growth online as consumers turned away from shopping in person and used disposable income that they were no longer spending on going out. That made for buoyant sales, as well as very bullish prognostications: consumer shoppers, observers said, were unlikely to go back to physical shopping in the same numbers even after the pandemic subsided. Lyst was a product of that: When it announced its $85 million raise, it planned for that to be its last fundraise ahead of an IPO, which it was planning potentially for London or New York as soon as this year. At the time it said it had 150 million users and a catalog of 8 million products from 17,000 brands and retailers. That list of brands includes a number of high-end labels such as Balenciaga, Balmain, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Fendi, Gucci, Moncler, Off-White, Prada, Saint Laurent and Valentino, and that combined with an active audience of shoppers led the company to strong growth. In 2020, gross merchandise value on Lyst was over $500 million. Between then and 2021, new user numbers grew 1,100%, and by the time the round was announced, GMV was at more than $2 billion. Fast-forward to today and the most optimistic and bullish prognostications in e-commerce have failed to play out: online sales have not continued with torrid growth, and people generally havent been spending as much online with the return to in-store shopping. That has led to some business contractions across the board. Amazon, the biggest of all e-commerce operations (which has been working to build out a strong line in fashion) may lay off as much as 10,000 staff and are cutting a lot of product lines. A more direct rival of Lysts, the high-end fashion e-commerce poster child Farfetch, currently has a market cap of just $2.9 billion, a giant drop compared to the $14 billion it commanded in May 2021. Many look to the holiday season as a critical indicator of how well e-commerce companies are doing in the current economy, and this year, so far, the figures are actually not as bad as many thought they would be: Adobes tracking of sales have shown big days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday both breaking sales records (respectively over $9 billion and over $11 billion). Cyber Monday online sales hit a record $11.3B, driven by demand, not just inflation, says Adobe Lyst itself has been seeing strong sales to kick off holiday shopping, posting its most profitable Black Friday weekend ever, with average order value up 15% albeit with more discounting across the brands and stores that sell on the site to gin up activity. But the bigger picture and the longer-term view are the factors driving todays news. In addition to a focus on getting profitable, our source tells us that Lysts IPO was more recently targeted for 2023, but those plans have now been pushed back, and that its looking to do a new round of funding partly because its low on cash flow. (To be clear, the company would not comment on these facts.) Well update this post as we learn more. If you want to contact us with a story tip, you can do so securely here."

        "Extracted Article": "Indias VerSe Innovation \u2014 the $5 billion Indian startup behind news aggregator Dailyhunt, short-video platform Josh and hyperlocal video app PublicVibe \u2014 has cut 150 employees, or 5% of its workforce of 3,000, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed. The Bengaluru-based startup informed impacted employees on Friday and separately held a town hall meeting on Monday where it announced pay cuts to its remaining staff, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Its a major turn for VerSe Innovation, which is backed by the likes of Google and Microsoft and raised more than $800 million in fresh funding as recently as April of this year. The change speaks to just how much the bottom has fallen out from under the advertising market, how thats impacting high-profile consumer businesses reliant on it and how thats stretching to even some of the fastest-growing digital markets like India. Given the current economic climate, like other businesses, we\u2019ve evaluated our strategic priorities. Considering the long-term viability of the business and our people, we have taken steps to implement our regular bi-annual performance management cycle and made performance and business considerations to streamline our costs and our teams, said Umang Bedi, co-founder of VerSe Innovation, in a prepared statement responding to queries originally sent on Saturday. He also confirmed that the startup implemented an 11% salary cut for all remaining employees with salaries above $12,200 (10 lakh Indian rupees) per annum. We remain extremely committed and bullish across our entire family of apps \u2014 Josh, Dailyhunt and PublicVibe \u2014 to drive profitable growth, he said. In April, VerSe Innovation raised $805 million at a nearly $5 billion valuation in a Series J round led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Board (Ontario Teachers\u2019), Luxor Capital, Sumeru Ventures, Sofina Group and Baillie Gifford. The startup at the time said that its Josh app \u2014 one of the local alternatives to TikTok, which India banned in mid-2020 \u2014 had climbed to over 150 million users, including 50 million creators. Similarly, Dailyhunt grew its creator ecosystem to over 100,000 content partners and crossed the mark of 350 million users, while PublicVibe expanded its user base to more than 5 million monthly active users. Nonetheless, that growth did not help VerSe Innovation offset its losses. In its regulatory filings, which Entrackr reported, the startup noted that its losses in the financial year 2021-22 grew over 217% to $314 million (2,563 crores Indian rupees) from $99 million (808 crores Indian rupees) in the previous year. However, its operating revenue reportedly increased about 45% to $118 million (965 crores Indian rupees) from $82 million (666 crores Indian rupees). VerSe Innovation has become the latest Indian startup to cut its workforce due to ongoing economic uncertainties. In the last couple of months, Byjus, Unacademy and Chargebee, among others, have laid off hundreds of employees."

        "Extracted Article": "Cairo-born and Dubai-based mass transit and shared mobility services provider SWVL has carried out its second round of layoffs affecting 50% of its remaining headcount, according to a statement shared by the company. The news is coming six months after SWVL laid off 32% of its workforce in a \u201cportfolio optimization program\u201d effort geared toward achieving positive cash flow next year. More than 400 employees were affected at the time, leaving more than 900 behind at the mobility company, based on data from its LinkedIn profile. But with this second round of layoffs, the number of employees at SWVL would have been reduced to a little over 450. Reports about a second round of layoffs at SWVL had been circulating for over two weeks as axed employees took to LinkedIn to share that they were open to new job opportunities. Local media said the layoffs affected teams across multiple departments, including tech and HR in Dubai and Pakistan. Another report has it that SWVL completely shuttered its Pakistan operations entirely two weeks ago. Although SWVL, in its statement, didn\u2019t confirm these reports, it did note that it was evaluating a \u201cpotential sale, scale back or discontinuation of operations\u201d of its smaller markets. It\u2019s unclear which markets the Dubai-based mobility company is referring to, but several sources have referred to Pakistan as one of its larger markets. As of June, SWVL, in its financial statement to investors, said it was present in 20 markets across four continents: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Chile, France, the U.K., Portugal and Brazil. SWVL went into some of these markets via acquisitions: Germany\u2019s door2door, Turkey\u2019s Voltlines, Mexico\u2019s Urbvan, Spain\u2019s Shotl and Argentina\u2019s Viapool (its planned acquisition of U.K.-based Zeelo was called off in July). When SWVL conducted its first round of layoffs, it said that though the acquisitions contributed to its overall growth, it needed to make reductions on roles automated by investments in its engineering, product and support functions teams. However, the second round of layoffs reveals a different story: the current economic downturn has exposed that SWVL scaled too fast and didn\u2019t have the necessary systems in place to make the acquisitions work. SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going public SWVL\u2019s sloppy operations despite claiming that it turned EBITDA-positive or break-even in half of its markets as of August are also evident in its stock market performance so far. In March, the mobility company went public via a SPAC merger with U.S. women-led blank check company Queen\u2019s Gambit Growth Capital. It listed at $9.95 per share on Nasdaq and targeted a $1.5 billion valuation. Several months later, SWVL has seen its valuation tank to $53 million and its share price drop by over 90% to $0.40 (price before the market opening). As a result, SWVL received a letter from Nasdaq this month saying it was not in compliance with a listing rule (its shares traded below $1 for 30 consecutive business days) and it had until May 1, 2023 (180 days) to regain compliance and avoid delisting (it must get its shares above $1). Cutting costs is one way SWVL believes will, in some way, affect its share price. The Dubai-based company stated it is taking these measures amid the continuing uncertainty in the global economic environment as the volatility in capital markets \u201cpotentially impact SWVL\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash from operating activities and external financings to fund working capital and service its commitments.\u201d The company, in the statement, said it is also reducing operating expenses including discretionary spending such as marketing expenses and other third-party services. Going forward, SWVLs broader optimization plan is to sharpen its focus on its largest markets which contribute the most to its revenues, including Egypt and Mexico. For the first half of the year, SWVL made $40.7 million in revenue, a 3.2x growth from H1 2021; however, its losses (including operating loss and recapitalization costs) during this same time amounted to over $161.6 million.

        "Extracted Article": "Jumia, as part of its streamlining efforts, reduced headcount among managerial roles by 60% in Dubai and undertook overall headcount reductions that resulted in more than 900 position terminations across its 11 markets, affecting 20% of its staff. This occurred in Q4 last year, according to Jumia\u2019s FY2022 financials. This news follows Jumia Supervisory Board\u2019s note on performing more senior management shake-ups when it appointed Francis Dufay as acting CEO last November in a bid to \u201cpick leaders and decision centers closer to consumers and sellers in Africa\u201d and Dufay\u2019s first interview with TechCrunch where he mentioned that Jumia had begun to make those changes. According to the then-acting-CEO, a handful of contracts had been terminated from the company\u2019s Dubai office while those who remained relocated to various African offices. He also told TechCrunch that Jumia was preparing to make significant staff reductions across 11 markets by the end of 2022. Jumia to cut products and overhead as new management chases profits It\u2019s too early to tell how far the changes will affect the e-commerce giant\u2019s bottom line, given how it has endured years of unending losses. For one, the company has recorded back-to-back losses every quarter since it went public in 2019; it finished 2022 with $207 million in adjusted EBITDA losses, a 5.3% rise from the $196 million it recorded the year before. Yet, there are reasons for investors to be optimistic. Between October 2022 and now, the headcount reductions and changes made by the new administration after their first 100 days allowed Jumia to save over 30% in monthly staff costs. \u201cThe implementation of these organizational changes resulted in $3.7 million in one-off restructuring costs booked in the fourth quarter of 2022,\u201d the company\u2019s statement added. Also, Jumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss has decreased in the last two quarters since new management took over. The company now expects to reduce losses by as much as 50% and end this year with about $100-120 million in losses. In other cost-cutting measures, Jumia has finalized some business exits it announced it would make in Q3 and Q4 2022; the e-tailer took these measures to improve resource allocation and focus on core areas with attractive investment returns. Jumia Prime will be discontinued across all its markets. The company will also suspend its logistics-as-a-service in all markets except Nigeria, Morocco and Ivory Coast. Then, it will scale back first-party groceries in Algeria, Ghana, Senegal and Tunisia. It will also discontinue food delivery operations in Egypt, Ghana and Senegal. The company stated these activities accounted for less than 1% of group GMV in the first nine months of 2022 and 2% of group adjusted EBITDA loss. Jumia reports record orders and revenue but investors remain unconvinced Meanwhile, quarterly active customers on Jumia dipped 15% from 3.8 million in Q4 2021 to 3.2 million customers in Q4 2022. Jumia said this happened because the economic environment in the countries it operates in limited how much users could spend. It also pointed to a deliberate reduction in how it promoted product categories with \u201cchallenging unit economics.\u201d The company also noticed declines in orders, gross merchandise value and total payment value from Q4 2021. Orders reduced 12.5% from 11.3 million to 9.9 million; GMV. 14% from 330.1 million to 283.1 million; and TPV, 18% from 90.5 million to 73.9 million. Despite the drop in metrics that Jumia had steadily grown over the past couple of quarters, its revenue stayed on course and witnessed a 7.1% year-on-year increase from 62 million in Q4 21 to 66.5 million in Q4 22. Also, gross profit increased 21.9% year-on-year as operating loss saw a 41% drop. In 2021, Jumia finished with $512.8 million ($117.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $395.7 million of term deposits and other financial assets). By the end of 2022, its liquidity had reduced by more than 50% to $227.8 ($72.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $155.7 million of term deposits and other financial assets). Shares of the Africa-focused and U.S.-headquartered e-commerce company fell about 10% to about $3.78 at the time of publication. And to some promising news, Dufay after replacing the company\u2019s co-founders last November and spending three months as acting CEO of Jumia has been appointed Jumia CEO. As such, \u201cthe executive search that was being conducted has now been concluded,\u201d the company said in its full-year 2022 financials. \u201cThe appointment reflects the strong confidence of the Board in the leadership of Francis and his ability to successfully scale the business to profitability.\u201d Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec step down as Jumia co-CEOs"

In the email viewed by TechCrunch, co-founders Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson informed employees they would receive an update later this morning letting them know if they are impacted by this layoff and with information on next steps. The co-founders said they take responsibility for the layoffs, which were the result of over-hiring in 2021 smacking into economic headwinds in 2022: Each and every one of you have made important contributions to this company, and saying goodbye to talented Nurons is not a decision we have taken lightly. For those of you leaving Nuro, we are very sorry for this outcome this is not the experience we wanted to create for you. We made this call and take full responsibility for todays circumstances. Ferguson and Zhu wrote that in 2021, it was the strongest fundraising environments in history. We saw an abundant supply of capital for deep tech companies and almost all companies were aggressively hiring and expanding, they wrote, adding that, In that environment, we determined it made sense to invest heavily across the board and grow our team rapidly. Exactly one year ago, Nuro raised $600 million in a fundraising round led by new investor Tiger Global Management. The Series D round, which pushed its valuation to about $8.6 billion, attracted high-profile investors including Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Google, China-based venture firm Gaorong Capital, grocery retailer Kroger, SoftBank Vision Fund 1, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Woven Capital, a venture arm of Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet. That led the company to double the size of its team in less than two years and significantly increased operating expenses based on an assumption that the funding environment would remain robust. This was a mistake, they wrote. Macroeconomic conditions in 2022, which include inflation and an impending U.S. recession, prompted the founders to slash costs, including cutting its workforce in an effort to extend its capital runway into 2025. Nuro still has more than $1 billion on its balance sheet, the pair wrote. Laid-off workers are being offered 12 weeks of severance pay and up to 14 weeks for those who have been with the company more than two years. The company will also pay out bonuses to those who are eligible, and are waiving the one-year vesting cliff on the equity front. Nuro will subsidize 100% of COBRA healthcare premiums (including families) through March 31, 2023, will provide career transition support and visa holders will also receive some notice period to ease this transition and, if applicable, travel assistance, the email said. While the company has made progress and is operating in Houston, Palo Alto and Mountain View, California, its also pulled back operations in at least one area. The company closed its Phoenix facility this summer as it shifted its commercial strategy away from the desert metropolis and toward the San Francisco Bay Area and Houston."

The laid-off staff make up 21% of the over 1,000 employees mainly in Kenya, where it links farmers or agricultural producers and fast-moving consumer goods manufactures to retailers. The agritechs CEO and co-founder Peter Njonjo told TechCrunch that the laid-off trade development representatives (TDRs) were given the option of working for the company as independent agents with pay based on the customers they acquire and sales they make. The representatives signed up vendors and were in charge of customer relations, gathering market intelligence and promoting products to clients. In the current proposition, the agents will carry out similar duties. Reports also state that Twiga has limited its staff travel allowances as part of its cost-cutting measures. \u201cTwiga recently launched a new optimized sales agents\u2019 program \u2026 where current trade development representatives will transition from permanent employees into independent agents on a 100% commission basis,\u201d said Twiga in response to a TechCrunch inquiry, adding that the transition of the TDRs was made in line with labor laws and that impacted employees were granted the first right of refusal to transition to the new model. Twiga starts commercial farming, looking to guarantee quality, sustain supply The company says it plans to create 1,000 opportunities through the agent model by the end of next year\u2019s first quarter. \u201cThis transition creates an opportunity for entrepreneurship open to former sales agents and the general public. The benefit of this transition is that it allows for higher earnings based on the effort and enterprise of the agent. This model has worked with other businesses like insurance and banking that have transitioned fully into Independent Agents in Kenya.\u201d Twiga, co-founded by Njonjo and Grant Brooke in 2014, joins the growing list of startups in Africa and across the globe downsizing amid a slowdown in VC funding, which has made capital for operations and growth hard to access. The changes come exactly a year after Twiga raised $50 million in series C round to scale in Kenya and expand to neighboring countries. The round was led by Paris- and Nairobi-based family office and private equity firm Creadev as TLcom Capital, IFC Ventures, DOB Equity and Goldman Sachs\u2019 spinoff Juven made follow-on investments. They also recently launched Twiga Fresh, an addition to its private label through which it will farm and distribute its own agricultural produce to traders and to deal with traceability challenges, stock outs and price volatility \u2014 which have made it hard for the company to deliver on its promise of affordability and food security.

        "Extracted Article": "African web3 startup Nestcoin has laid off some employees as FTXs demise impacted its business. This information was shared by the startups CEO, Yele Bademosi, who, in a tweet, said FTXs fall from grace affected his one-year-old startup, which held assets (cash and stablecoins) in the now-defunct crypto exchange to manage operational expenses. Since Sam Bankman-Frieds crypto empire made up of FTX, Alameda Research and FTX Ventures collapsed last week, there have been various reports of companies whose money is stuck in FTX, its crypto exchange platform. Some of them include Galois Capital, a hedge fund with half of its capital stuck at the collapsed crypto exchange; Genesis Trading, which had about $175 million locked on the crypto exchange; and Multicoin Capital, the famed crypto and web3 venture capital firm that has nearly 10% of its assets under management trapped. Nestcoin joins that growing list (more names are becoming known by the day); it appears most, if not all, of its assets, are stuck in FTX. According to several reports, companies with money stuck on FTX might get their money back depending on how much FTXs assets are ultimately worth. From its 23-page bankruptcy filing, FTX has more than 100,000 creditors, with assets in the range of $10 billion to $50 billion and liabilities within the same range. Nestcoin raises $6.45M pre-seed to accelerate crypto and web3 adoption in Africa and frontier markets Nestcoin, which Bademosi described in an interview with TechCrunch as a venture collective, is one of a handful of African startups that have received venture capital from FTX and Alameda Research, alongside 200+ foreign-based startups and investment firms, including Circle and Sequoia Capital. FTX, for instance, led a $150 million Series C extension round in Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company. Alameda Research, on the other hand, has backed Nigeria- and Kenya-based web3 company MARA; South African crypto exchange startup VALR; Congolese web3 startup Jambo; and Nigerian crypto exchange platform Bitnob. Its still unclear if these other startups held their assets in FTX, but theres a slight chance that might be the case, given whats come to light with Nestcoin, even though Alameda Research, its investor, has less than 1% equity. We used the closely-associated exchange, FTX, as a custodian to store a significant proportion of the stablecoin investment we raised, i.e., our day-to-day operational budget, said Bademosi in his tweet. We were not undertaking any trading, but simply custodied our assets on the FTX exchange. While there are uncertainties, including the outcome of our assets held at FTX, we as a company have to adjust our plans, rethink our strategy and take steps to better position ourselves for the future. An update shared with our investors earlier today on the FTX incident and its impact on @Nestcoin. pic.twitter.com/0Mjo4SYF7R &mdash; YB \ud83d\udfe2 \ud83d\udfe1 \ud83d\udd34 (@YeleBademosi) November 14, 2022 To that end, Nestcoin, which Bademosi launched last February to build, invest and operate web3 and non-custodial products for customers in frontier markets across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), media, digital art and gaming, has had to reduce its headcount. According to two people familiar with the matter, Nestcoin layoffs will affect at least 30 employees from sub-departments, including Breach, its media arm; Brunch, a group messaging app with a crypto wallet; and Metaverse Magma (MVM), a gaming DAO that raised $3.2 million at a $30 million valuation two months ago. The remaining employees will see their salaries slashed by as much as 40%, the people said. On the other hand, Nestcoin noted that its products are DeFi protocols &amp; non-custodial; thus, it has never held customer funds, and this incident has no impact on our customers financially. The rest of Bademosis tweet reads: While this is a challenging time for us and the industry as a whole we see this as a wake up call to focus on building a more decentralized crypto future where no one organization or person can amass enough power to influence a nascent industry that has the potential to do good. In the past few days Ive strengthened my resolve and remain committed to doing crypto in line with its true spirit and founding ethos. At Nestcoin we have a renewed sense of purpose we realize that for crypto to truly go mainstream, we must accelerate the transition to self custody by building compelling trustless crypt products. To succeed, we will remain relentless, resourceful and flexible as we navigate these hard times. UPDATE: Chipper Cash, MARA, Bitnob and VALR have confirmed that they had zero exposure to FTX in the wake of its crash. Read more. RIP to FTX?"

        "Extracted Article": "SoundHound \u2014 maker of the voice AI technology used by Mercedes-Benz, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Mastercard and more \u2014 has laid off about 10% of its workforce amid ongoing economic turmoil across global markets. The Santa Clara-headquartered company \u2014 which went public via a SPAC in April of this year \u2014 announced the decision to its employees on Wednesday. Alongside that, it also imposed salary cuts for some of those not laid off. The company did not specify the details of the salary cuts, nor how many were affected. Yesterday, we announced to our SoundHounders that we are taking actions to streamline our company, including an approximate 10% reduction in workforce. We dont take this lightly, but in the face of challenging market conditions, we must channel our investments into the areas that continue to drive growth and allow us to best serve our customers. Were extremely grateful to the departing colleagues that have contributed to our success as a leading voice AI platform, a SoundHound spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. SoundHound has a total headcount of 450 employees \u2014 meaning that the layoff has impacted around 45 people. The company will likely share more details during its Q3 earnings call later today. Founded in 2005, SoundHound offers its voice AI platform in 25 languages. It powers voice-enabled experiences in a number of the cars provided by Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Honda. Earlier this month, the company also tied up with Samsungs Harman International to offer fully OEM-owned and branded in-vehicle voice experience to several vehicles. Alongside offering its standalone platform to companies, SoundHound has two mobile apps, namely SoundHound Music, which works similar to Apples Shazam and lets users discover music playing around them, and Hound, which offers voice-based search and assistance. In November last year, SoundHound announced it would go public via a SPAC transaction with blank check company Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners at a nearly $2.1 billion valuation. It was over 5x what Apple paid for its competitor Shazam, a $400 million deal announced in December 2017 and closed in September 2018. But its fortunes as a public company have been mixed. In its last quarterly results for the second quarter that ended on June 30, SoundHound reported a 26% year-on-year revenue drop to $6.2 million, while Q2 net loss spiked to nearly $31 million, compared to $15 million in the same quarter a year before. And its market cap, like that of many tech companies at the moment, is not doing very well. Its currently trading at around $2/share with a market cap of $406 million. SoundHound has become another tech company to take the layoff route during this economic slowdown. In addition to recent layoffs announced by Facebook owner Meta and Twitter, others, including Netflix, Salesforce, Spotify, Tencent and many others, have cut collectively tens of thousands of jobs in the last several months. Indian startups such as Byjus, Ola and Unacademy have also laid off hundreds of employees to reduce their operating expenses amid a dip in funding and investments."

The Vancouver-based company informed the affected employees about the move earlier this week, a person familiar with the development said. As we at Kabam reviewed our strategic priorities, we made the decision to adjust our resourcing structure in alignment with our goals. This means that while we will continue to hire in key areas in the year ahead, unfortunately, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 7%. For those we are parting ways with, we are grateful to [sic] their contributions to our success, and are supporting them through this challenging transition, a Kabam spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The company has a headcount of over 500 employees. Kabam has a catalog of mobile games generating hundreds of millions of downloads in total, including Marvel Contest of Champions, Disney Mirrorverse, Shop Titans, Transformers: Forged to Fight, Mini Guns, Fast &amp; Furious 6: The Game, Fast &amp; Furious: Legacy and Blastron. The company also has studios and offices in Montreal, San Francisco, Charlottetown, Austin and Los Angeles \u2014 alongside its headquarters in Vancouver. Founded in 2006, the gaming company ran as a startup until 2016 when it was acquired by South Koreas Netmarble Games for a reported $700 million to $800 million. In March this year, Netmarbles North American operations merged with Kabam. It aimed to bring many Netmarble game titles to western markets. Kabam is one of many companies in the tech world that have cut its workforce during this economic slowdown. In the last few days, the impact of the ongoing financial crunch was largely seen through massive layoffs announced by Twitter and Meta. Companies including Netflix, Spotify and Tencent also let some of their staff go. Similarly, Indian startups such as Unacademy, Byjus and Ola have also laid off hundreds and thousands of employees to reduce the burden of limited funding and investments."

        "Extracted Article": "Benitago Group\u2019s website no longer working this week set off an alarm bell for some folks, those who regularly follow the comings-and-goings of active fulfillment-by-Amazon aggregators. They believed it might spell the end for the e-commerce aggregator, which raised $380 million in equity and debt financing last year. Co-founder Benedict Dohmen confirmed to TechCrunch via a LinkedIn message that \u201cBenitago (or any related entity) is not shutting down its operations. We have not sold or disposed of any assets.\u201d Though the company did make a few acquisitions this year, it shifted gears toward brand incubation and operations, or essentially developing their own brands. And unfortunately, this decision led the company to cut staff. One former colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, told me they were with the company for only about three months before his department was let go. Dohmen confirmed the layoffs. \u201cWe unfortunately had to reduce the size of our teams by 14%, primarily in the M&amp;A and talent acquisition departments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe underestimated the probability and impact of an e-commerce market downtrend. As the world has changed and market pressure for probability rose, we shifted focus towards incubation and operations.\u201d The company was started by Benedict Dohmen and Santiago Nestares (Benitago, get it?) back when they were at Dartmouth College seven years ago. We profiled the company in March 2021 when it raised $55 million in both equity and debt to go about funding acquisitions of brands built to sell on Amazon\u2019s marketplace. Benitago leaning into brand development was more of a return to its roots than anything, Dohmen said. The company began as an incubator and operator. It wasn\u2019t until later in 2021, around the time the company raised a whopping $325 million in Series A equity and debt, that it developed \u201can acquisitive M&amp;A arm,\u201d he added. E-commerce aggregators buy up brands from marketplaces, like Amazon and Shopify. As we\u2019ve reported, just this week in fact, these kinds of businesses have seen their sector go from very hot two years ago to cool. Some have continued to do well, even grabbing the now random venture capital deal, while others found the funding firehose dry up. Dohmen, too, noted that the shift in strategy to focus on brand incubation and operations was \u201cdue to the increasing cost of debt.\u201d The new focus seems to be paying off for the company now. The incubation effort accounts for 20% of Benitago\u2019s business and is growing 88% quarter over quarter, Dohmen said. Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was up 308% from last year, and this quarter \u201cwas Benitago\u2019s most profitable and cash-flowing quarter yet,\u201d he added. The company has since developed five international brands, operates over 10 brands and has more than 300 new products in the pipeline. Dohmen doesn\u2019t believe Benitago is done with M&amp;A, but does admit that future acquisitions will be \u201cmore targeted,\u201d and instead of casting a wide net on Amazon, it \u201cwill only seek brands that fit with our current brands\u2019 strategic direction.\u201d \u201cWe regret being overly optimistic and not foreseeing the e-commerce downtrend and the rising cost of capital,\u201d Dohmen said. \u201cWe take full responsibility and are sad about the reduction in team. But were excited about the brands and products we have in the pipeline, and were excited to come out of this recession much stronger.\u201d What does the future look like for e-commerce aggregators?"

The Chennai and San Francisco-headquartered startup, which offers billing, subscription, revenue and compliance management solutions, confirmed to TechCrunch that the update impacted 142 employees. This decision was a difficult one, and we want to first acknowledge and thank the team members who helped us get where we are today. Chargebee has grown exponentially over the last few years, and amid changing market conditions, we have decided to proactively refocus resources to set a strong foundation on which to continue our growth, said Penny Desatnik, director of corporate communications at Chargebee, in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. We will continue to build and strengthen key relationships, and by focusing on efficient growth, we expect to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and operations to meet the rising market demand for subscription services across B2C and B2B businesses. We wish success to our former colleagues and remain committed to the success of our customers and partners around the globe, Desatnik added. On Wednesday, Chargebee co-founder and CEO Krish Subramanian wrote on a LinkedIn post that the startup had changed its hiring plan to align with priorities owing to the macroeconomic factors and started reducing its expenses across various areas, including tools, consulting and contractors due to a growing gap between revenue and spending. While the scaling decisions were under our control and responsibility, the economic situation and lack of visibility into the future has made it harder for everyone, the note said. The affected employees will receive three months of pay and extended medical benefits while they look for new opportunities, he added. The startup will also offer outplacement career services and an extension of time to exercise stock options granted under its stock incentive plan. Chargebee raised $250 million in a Series H round in February \u2014 over nine months after earning unicorn status following the $125 million Series G funding in April last year. The startup counts Insight Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India among its key backers. Unfavorable economic conditions have impacted several startups and tech companies around the world. In the last few months, Indian startups including Unacademy, Byjus and Ola have cut their workforces amid a significant dip in the funding. U.S. companies including digital bank Chime, online real estate marketplace Opendoor and lending giant Upstart also recently made similar decisions."

Automation, agriculture and a climate-bent are green flags, but no category is immune from mounting economic headwinds on top of the already difficult task of launching a successful startup. While robotics has thus far seen a limited slowdown in investing relative to many other sectors, there\u2019s no such thing as a recession-proof business in startup land. Bay Area-based Iron Ox has certainly had no shortage of supporters. The agtech firm has raised north of $100 million, culminating with a $53 million Series C announced in September of last year. But earlier this week, the robotic agtech startup instituted widespread layoffs. All told, 50 jobs were cut this week, a figure that amounts to nearly half of the companys staff of just over 100 people. Chief Legal Officer Myra Pasek tells TechCrunch that the decision was made in order to extend [its] cash runway. Pasek adds: Weve decided to hyperfocus on our core competence of engineering and technology; as a result, we eliminated many roles that are not core to our renewed focus. However, the layoff was comprehensive and included positions throughout the organization i.e., not limited to only certain departments. Reducing the Iron Ox team was a painful decision one we did not take lightly. We are working with our board members and leaning into our extensive ecosystem throughout Silicon Valley to help employees find meaningful new work at mission-aligned companies. Iron Ox has always hired world-class talent, and Im confident that the individuals we unfortunately had to cut this week will have many options open to them. As a matter of policy, we are not going to provide additional details or comment on specific personnel, and we ask that you respect their privacy at this sensitive time. Its a massive blow for a well-funded firm at the cross section of several growth areas. Iron Ox\u2019s play has focused on fully automated greenhouses, courtesy of robotic arms, Kiva-like plant moving carts and other technologies. Utilizing indoor growing techniques and a trove of data, the pitch promised broader growing seasons in more diverse climates and the utilization of less resources than standard farming, all while still harnessing the sun in a way that is often altogether removed from vertical farming. Precisely what shape the new focus will take remains to be seen, though the companys site reflects a broad range of different satellite categories, including plant and data science and robotics. Speaking with TechCrunch, Iron Ox explained that it had no intention of winding down operations, though the firm is seemingly open to both seeking additional funding and, perhaps, even a sale. [A]t Iron Ox, our attitude is that we are always willing and eager to meet with mission-aligned investors who want to decarbonize the agriculture sector, Pasek says. Like other competitive startups, we never stop fundraising. We are not talking about winding down operations we are more focused than ever on our core competencies in engineering and technology."

        "Extracted Article": "Lending giant Upstart has laid off about 140 employees \u2014 or 7% of its total workforce \u2014 who help process loan applications, sources told TechCrunch. The cloud-based AI lending platform notified its affected employees about the layoff on Tuesday. Upstart had about 2,000 employees, according to the company, which confirmed the layoffs. Given the challenging economy, we are making this difficult decision for the long-term health of the company. We do not expect any further layoffs, and continue to hire for roles that are strategic to our business, Upstart spokesperson Mike Nelson said in a statement. Upstart said in its latest 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the decision was due to ongoing economic challenges and the reduction in the volume of loans on its platform. However, the company would not confirm the exact drop in its loan volumes. In its last quarterly results in August, the California-based company reported a 72% annual increase in loan volumes on its platform from 456,610 in the first half of 2021 to a total of 786,675 in the same period a year later. The earnings for the third quarter are due on November 8. Upstart is facing difficulties owing to weakening demand for loans in the U.S. due to significant hikes in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cope with the global rise in inflation. The companys share price dropped by 84% this year. Upstart was trading at $22.88 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. The market cap of Upstart rose to nearly $32 billion at one point after its public debut in November 2020. Since, the companys total stock value dipped to less than $2 billion earlier on Tuesday. Unfavorable economic conditions have not only impacted the lending industry but also many technology companies around the globe. Telehealth unicorn Cerebral, online real estate marketplace Zillow and SurveyMonkey parent Momentive Global have all laid off employees in recent weeks. Companies including Netflix, Spotify and Tencent also made similar decisions. Indian startups such as Byjus and Ola have also sacked their employees amid the dip in funding and investments. The tide is shifting on tech\u2019s layoff wave. Kind of."

The Seattle-headquartered online real estate marketplace informed its impacted employees about the decision on Tuesday. Shortly after receiving the communication, the impacted employees had to leave the company. The layoffs impacted Zillow Offer advisors, PA sales and back-end staff at Zillow Home Loans and Zillow Closing Services, as well as other teams. As part of our normal business process, we continuously evaluate and responsibly manage our resources as we create digital solutions to make it easier for people to move. This week, we have made the difficult \u2014 but necessary \u2014 decision to eliminate a small number of roles and will shift those resources to key growth areas around our housing super-app. Were still hiring in key technology-related roles across the company, a Zillow spokesperson said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. The company did not reveal the percentage of its workforce affected by the decision. However, in its last quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in August, Zillow reported that it had 5,791 full-time employees in its workforce. Using that figure, this layoff has impacted around 5% of employees. In November last year, Zillow announced that it would lay off a quarter of its staff \u2014 around 2,000 people \u2014 due to shutting down its home-buying service Offers that aimed to provide sellers with instant home offers. The company, at the time, had 8,000 employees. What does Zillow\u2019s exit tell us about the health of the iBuying market? Zillow has become one of the latest tech companies to lay off employees during this economic slowdown. Earlier this week, telehealth unicorn Cerebral reduced its workforce by 20% due to an ongoing push for efficiency. Companies including Netflix, Momentive Global, Spotify and Tencent have also made similar decisions recently. Similarly, Indian startups including Byjus and Ola have let hundreds of employees go amid the downfall of funding and investments. A troubling startup layoff trend has emerged"

A spokesperson for Cerebral confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch but did not share the specific number of employees affected. According to the WSJ, which first reported the news, and Insider, some 400 people will lose their jobs, primarily clinical staff and care counselors. \u201cToday\u2019s changes are part of Cerebral\u2019s ongoing transformation program, which drives to create more sustainable growth and stability, while further delivering our mission to democratize access to high-quality mental health care for all,\u201d a Cerebal spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThese changes are focused specifically on realizing operational efficiencies while prioritizing clinical quality and safety across the organization.\u201d The company did not explain what type of severance, if any, was offered to employees, but did tell TechCrunch we are doing everything we can to support our impacted colleagues as they pursue other opportunities. Cerebral\u2019s model explains care counselors meet with patients regularly to manage medications prescribed by clinicians and provide support. How Cerebral and Alto Neuroscience embarked on an at-home clinical trial for depression The SoftBank-backed company has come under scrutiny for making it easier to provide ADHD medication to potential clients. Perhaps too easy: allegations led to an investigation by the Department of Justice into potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act for overprescribing prescriptions such as Adderall. A lawsuit was also filed against the company by Matthew Truebe, former vice president of product and engineering, alleging company higher-ups encouraged Cerebral employees to prescribe stimulants to all ADHD patients. According to a press release, the company has since stopped providing those services, citing the need to review its clinical quality and safety processes. \u201cBased on recent feedback from stakeholders, it is clear that this has become a distraction from our focus to democratize access to mental health care services, provide treatment for more patients and add service lines for new conditions,\u201d Robertson said in the release. The San Francisco-based company has raised more than $426 million since its founding in 2020, $300 million of which was announced in a Series C last December. Cerebral is valued at $4.8 billion, according to Behavioral Health Business. Earlier this year Cerebral laid off \u201chundreds\u201d of people, primarily affecting its support and operations team to better its programs. At the time, the company did not provide any details to TechCrunch explaining any severance offered to employees.

        "Extracted Article": "Clear Capital, a real estate valuation technology company and firm, is laying off 27% of its staff months after freezing mass hiring, TechCrunch has learned from sources. A spokesperson for Clear Capital confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch but did not share the specific number of employees impacted. Last November, the company announced they had 1,400 total global employees, so using that figure the layoff could have impacted 378 employees. The reduction primarily impacted its operational team, according to sources. \u201cClear Capital is restructuring all company divisions to reduce expenses and support our future business strategy amidst today\u2019s housing market reality,\u201d said Duane Andrews, CEO of Clear Capital in a written statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThis will allow us to refocus the business on key areas and ensure we are on track for sustainable growth. The CEO also cited \u201dthe impact of a rising interest rate environment in the mortgage industry has resulted in a significant decrease in volume from our customers,\u201d as a reason for the layoffs. The company did not explain what type of severance, if any, was offered to employees. In an internal memo sent to employees obtained by TechCrunch, Andrews explained Clear Capital executives had anticipated a decrease in work volume over the summer but did not expect to make cuts come fall. \u201cKeeping folks engaged and contributing was necessary; our forecasts showed that the Fall would bring increased volume,\u201d read Andrews memo. \u201cAs we approached Fall, the markets stated indicating otherwise, and we now know volume will not return for a significant period of time.\u201d Andrews added the decision to cut staff and locations was \u201ca last resort\u201d and \u201cthere are no guarantees\u201d that further cuts won\u2019t be made. Sources explained employees were required to attend an \u201cabrupt\u201d Google Meet call at 9 a.m. PST on Wednesday. Once in, they were split into two groups: those that would remain and those laid off. Employees were told back in August that there would be no layoffs, sources say. Sources declined to comment on the record due to fear of retaliation, and because they said Clear Capital advised employees not to speak to the press. According to a meeting call recording obtained by TechCrunch, Clear Capitals Vice President of Customer Success Heather Shick and Executive Vice President of Customer Experience Luke Fredrick addressed the layoffs to employees and asked for those staying to feed into their \u201cgrit.\u201d \u201cEverything that we planned on with this was so that we didn\u2019t need to do it again,\u201d Shick said, \u201cOur goal is to not have this meeting a second time, but there is no guarantee. Your workloads are going to change. You\u2019re going to be busier. We are all going to be busier, and its going to be tough.\u201d Shick further explained in the call that inflation rates in the real estate investing market led to the company\u2019s decision. Inflation rates have surged drastically after the COVID-19 pandemic and have impacted the real estate space. As the once-hot market begins to freeze, the rate hike has brought into question if there will be a potential recession. The Reno, Nevada-based company claims to be the \u201cleader in property valuation management and data solutions,\u201d and works as the middleman for banks, investors and homeowners. Last year, the company bought CubiCasa, a Finland-based floor planning app for iOS and Android for an undisclosed amount. Despite the company\u2019s signs of growth, it was facing declines in customer volume to which Clear Capital cites macroeconomic conditions. Employees laid off explained that the decision was unexpected and caught them by surprise. One source told TechCrunch they \u201cfeel in shambles.\u201d During the meeting, Clear Capital announced it would be closing its Truckee, California office and said there will be no operational staff in its Roseville, California location. Those still employed are expected to return back to in-person work on October 24. Current and former Clear Capital employees can contact Andrew Mendez by e-mail at andrew.mendez@techcrunch.com or on Signal, a secure encrypted messaging app, at 669-832-6800.

        "Extracted Article": "Indian edtech giant Byjus said on Wednesday it will eliminate 5% of its workforce, or about 2,500 roles, across multiple departments and is cutting its marketing budgets as it looks to improve its finances and achieve profitability by end of the current financial year. This the second significant layoff the startup, valued at $22 billion, is undertaking in recent months. In June, it cut hundreds of jobs. The move comes amid the ongoing global market downturn, which has forced many startups, including Byjus, to postpone their plans to file for an initial public offering. The startup said it is retargeting its marketing budget toward more efficient growth. Since significant brand awareness has been created in India over the past few years, there is a scope to optimise marketing budgets locally and prioritise spending to increase brand awareness in overseas markets, it said in a statement. The Indian startup has moved to clear its debts and other balances in recent months. It recently cleared all its dues to Blackstone by paying $234 million it owed the global investment giant for the $1 billion acquisition of Aakash, TechCrunch reported earlier. The startup, which posted a net loss of $577.4 million, is aiming to become profitable by the end of the current financial year. It generated a gross revenue of $1.258 billion (unaudited) in the financial year that ended in March this year. Between April and July, the startup logged revenue of $570 million, it said. Byju\u2019s counts Prosus Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia Capital India, Silver Lake, Owl Ventures, UBS and Blackrock among its backers and has raised nearly $6 billion to date. \u201cAs a mature organisation that takes its responsibility towards investors and stakeholders seriously, we aim to ensure sustainable growth alongside strong revenue growth. These measures will help us achieve profitability in the defined time frame of March 2023,\u201d said Mrinal Mohit, chief executive of Byjus India business, in a statement. Todays startup layoffs have nothing on the 2020 correction Byju\u2019s founder Byju Raveendran told TechCrunch in an interview last month that he doesnt think the startup will file for an IPO in the next 12 months. He also said the startup is in talks to close a new funding round from sovereign funds in the coming weeks. At a group level, Byjus will continue to hire across all levels and will end this financial year as a net hirer. Byjus plans to hire a total of 10,000 more teachers in the coming year, adding to its current strength of 20,000 teachers. To fuel its growth, the company is expanding its teams along with hiring senior leadership to further build operational strength, the company said in a statement."

        "Extracted Article": "Noom, a health coaching platform valued at $3.7 billion last year, is laying off a portion of staff for the second time in a matter of months, TechCrunch has learned from sources. Noom has laid off 10% of its staff, or around 500 people, which is a reduction that mostly impacts its coaching team. It\u2019s the second layoff impacting Noom\u2019s coaching team in a matter of months, impacting hundreds of employees. Sources say that Noom has nearly halved its number of coaches since the beginning of the year, which looks to currently be around 1,000 coaches. Noom has experienced extraordinary growth over the past several years, and it\u2019s essential that we are structured in a way that enables us to continue growing over the long term, a Noom spokesperson said over e-mail. We recently made the difficult decision to reduce the number of Noom employees. We are deeply grateful for their contributions to Noom, and we wish them continued success. Noom declined to answer questions regarding scale of layoffs, separation packages and strategy beyond this statement. The startup, which has raised over $650 million in funding since launching in 2008, is partially known for its controversial approach to weight loss and dieting. Now, however, it\u2019s showing tensions from a personnel front. Noom\u2019s scaleback of its coaching services suggests a departure from the platform\u2019s original pitch, which was to combine intelligent nutrition with exercise coaching. In 2020, Noom hit $400 million in revenue using this strategy. One year later, Noom expanded its coaching services by launching a mental health vertical. Its current website shows a glimpse of how Noom thinks, or at least thought, about coaching as its strategy. \u201cWelcome to the Noomily,\u201d Noom\u2019s website reads. \u201cOur coaches guide users through the ups and downs of the weight loss journey with empathy and compassion. They help users better understand themselves through personalized action plans that are based on their individual goals, preferences, and lifestyle.\u201d The landing page for coaches goes on to explain the daily life of a Noom coach, which ranges from helping clients develop \u201ca healthy lifestyle\u201d and \u201ccontribute to the growth of something amazing.\u201d Coaches are able to enroll in health plans after 90 days of employment, the website said. Now, however, that advertising has a different tone. The company is reportedly moving more to scheduled video calling instead of live chat. According to a memo obtained by TechCrunch, Noom co-founders Artem Petakov and Saeju Jeong addressed the layoffs to employees and said that it was critical for the company to \u201cmanage expenses, increase efficiency and be more effective about how we achieve our mission\u201d despite \u201csignificantly improving\u201d company financials. \u201cToday\u2019s decisions put us in a position where we can continue to place big bets for the next year, and innovate and grow in the years ahead,\u201d the co-founders wrote in the internal memo. Today\u2019s layoff comes right as the company\u2019s CFO, Mike Noonan, leaves to join TripAdvisor, The Wall Street Journal reports. A Noom spokesperson said over e-mail that the layoffs and CFO departure are two separate, unrelated announcements. In the internal memo, the co-founders went on to say that the startups big bet is focused on creating a more comprehensive mind and body platform with a higher degree of personalization. The co-founders nodded to their enterprise offering as \u201canother bet that has the potential to dramatically expand our customer base.\u201d \u201cFinally, over the next few days, we may see unkind headlines, but ask that you maintain focus on whats most important now: caring for our departing colleagues like family, by treating them with humanity and respect,\u201d the co-founders wrote. The company was last known to be reportedly planning for a 2022 IPO, at a $10 billion valuation.

        "Extracted Article": "Corporate spend management startup Brex has laid off 136 people, or 11% of its staff, across all departments as part of a restructuring, the company has told TechCrunch exclusively. After the layoffs, Brex has just over 1,150 employees. It\u2019s been a tumultuous year for Brex, which announced in April that it was leaning into the enterprise segment. That new focus led to the company announcing in June that it would no longer work with small businesses or non professionally funded startups. The latter news caused a bit of an uproar and some feelings of abandonment in the startup community, which Brex initially set out to serve. Internally, the move apparently left less of a need for certain internal staff who were focused on serving those SMBs. Brex said it initially tried to \u201crepurpose\u201d as many roles as it could before ultimately deciding it had to let some people go. The layoffs also are evidence that even decacorns are not immune to the challenging macro and fundraising environment that 2022 has brought us. It was exactly nine months ago that Brex confirmed that it had raised $300 million in a Series D-2 round at a $12.3 billion valuation. Greenoaks Capital and TCV co-led that financing, which brought the three-year-old San Francisco-based startup\u2019s total raised to $1.2 billion. Fintech Brex confirms $12.3B valuation, snaps up Meta exec to serve as its head of product Unsurprisingly, Brex cited the challenging macro environment in its decision. In a blog post, co-founder and co-CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote: Late last year we decided to sharpen our focus and serve fewer customers really well. Today\u2019s change is a continuation of this. We\u2019ve been laser-focused on serving early-stage startups and scaled companies this year, and we\u2019re very grateful for the momentum we\u2019ve seen on Empower since we launched in April. While we\u2019re fortunate to be in a strong financial position with many years of runway, the new macro environment is materially different from the first five years of Brex, and warrants a new level of focus and financial discipline. We know the importance that our customers place on Brex\u2019s financial strength, and this change will put us on a path to sustainable profitability over the next few years. Over the summer, Sam Blond left his role as chief revenue officer at Brex to become an investor at Founders Fund. His replacement, Doug Adamic, had over 16 years experience at SAP/Concur most recently as that companys chief revenue officer and is helping drive enterprise sales, according to the company. More recently, sources told TechCrunch that Adam Swiecicki is stepping down from his role as chief financial officer at Brex, a position he assumed late last year when Michael Tannenbaum took on the position of chief operating officer. He will be joining workforce platform Rippling, which recently entered the spend management space, as CFO. Brex confirmed Swiecickis impending move, with co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras telling TechCrunch: Were happy for Adam in his next role and its always great to see our team land with great companies. Rippling is a Brex partner and is focused on the small business market, while Brex has moved upmarket. From our side, Michael Tannenbaum will resume the role of CFO. Moving forward, Tannenbaum who began serving as CFO initially in 2017 will serve in both positions. Swiecicki\u2019s decision to leave is reportedly unrelated to the layoff. In an attempt to soften the blow for the laid-off workers, Brex said the affected employees will receive eight weeks of pay, with an additional two weeks for each complete year of service. For those with less than one year at the company, the startup said it is waiving the equity cliff. And for those with options, it is offering to extend the exercise period to seven years. Impacted workers will have access to current healthcare benefits through the end of the month, and then Brex says it will pay for six months of health insurance. The company says it is also dedicating part of its recruiting team to help those impacted \u201cfind new opportunities,\u201d and will prioritize hiring them back \u201cas roles open up over time.\u201d Additionally, Brex is letting all impacted employees keep their computers. Brex started its life focused on providing credit cards aimed mainly at startups and SMBs. It gradually evolved its model with the aim of serving as a one-stop finance shop for these companies before its aforementioned pivot to a focus on enterprise earlier this year. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company is \u201cgetting some really strong signals on Empower, its new enterprise-focused software offering. Since Empowers April launch, its monthly active user count has grown 5x month-over-month \u201con an increasingly large base, the spokesperson added. It also, the company said, passed $3 billion in annualized processing volume in less than three months of the platform going live. Meanwhile, the spokesperson told TechCrunch that Brex cash deposits are up 100% year over year, noting that rising interest rates have actually increased the revenue in its deposits business. Brex declined to share hard revenue figures, saying only that \u201cgrowth even in this environment is remaining quite strong.\u201d The company obviously took a big chance by betting on the enterprise space. It will be interesting to see how that bet plays out. Reporters note: The story was updated post-publication to clarify that Swiecicki will be joining Rippling as CFO.

Spotify will also reassign some staff to other podcasts, we understand. Reached for comment, Spotify said it does not comment publicly on staffing changes. Over the next couple of months, podcasts leaving the platform include Gimlets \u201cHow to Save a Planet,\u201d \u201cCrime Show,\u201d \u201cEvery Little Thing,\u201d as well as Parcasts \u201cMedical Murders,\u201d \u201cFemale Criminals,\u201d \u201cCrimes of Passion,\u201d \u201cDictator,\u201d \u201cMythology,\u201d \u201cHaunted Places\u201d and \u201cUrban Legends.\u201d In the second quarter of 2023, Spotify will also say goodbye to \u201cHoroscope Today.\u201d In an internal note, chief content officer of Spotify, Dawn Ostroff, and Julie McNamara, head of U.S. studios and video, wrote that Nicole Beemsterboer will become Gimlet\u2019s new managing director, the source familiar with the matter shared. Liliana Kim has been brought on as the new managing director of Parcast. This is the first time Spotify has made a group cancellation of podcasts. The move was likely made to help strengthen its slate of original and exclusive (O&amp;E) podcasts, which include hit shows \u201cBatman Unburied,\u201d \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d and the newly released Kim Kardashian\u2019s \u201cThe System: The Case of Kevin Keith.\u201d Similar to cancellations in the TV industry, Spotify appears to be weeding out the duds. This could make room for the several upcoming O&amp;E (original and exclusive) titles that the company intends to announce in the weeks and months ahead, we hear. Overall, the music streaming platform has a total of 500+ O&amp;E podcasts produced across its four in-house studios, Spotify Studios, The Ringer, Parcast and Gimlet. The cancellations didn\u2019t impact Spotify Studios and The Ringer. Last month, Spotify launched over 300,000 audiobooks, a new feature that puts the company in direct competition with top audiobook providers Audible, Audiobooks, Google and Nook, among others.

        "Extracted Article": "Spin, which was acquired by Tier Mobility earlier this year, has laid off about 10% of its staff \u2014 including a number of executives \u2014 and is exiting Canada and Seattle, TechCrunch has learned. The micromobility company informed its workforce of more than 700 during a Friday all-hands meeting that lower-than-expected demand in the U.S. amid the waning pandemic, along with economic conditions such as rising inflation and a tightening VC funding environment, led to the decision. About 78 people, the majority of whom are white-collar workers based in its San Francisco headquarters, have been laid off. The affected employees were notified prior to the meeting. Staff was also told that it is exiting Kelowna, British Columbia, and Seattle, where it was just invited to return as a bikeshare vendor for 2023. Seattles Department of Transportation told TechCrunch that Spin, which operated a scootershare in Seattle from 2021 to 2022, was not granted a permit to continue scooter operations in 2023; the DOT said it was working with Spin to confirm their plans in light of the recent announcement. Spin had operations in Edmonton, Red Deer and St. Albert, Canada, but never reactivated those cities after winter ended this year. Kelowna was its last remaining Canadian market. Philip Reinckens, a Tier veteran who took the CEO spot in May, delivered the news to employees, according to sources who asked not to be named. During the 20-minute meeting, Reinckens told workers that the companys priorities are to preserve cash and achieve profitability. Notably, he said the entire micromobility industry was suffering from a perfect storm of events that included supply chain constraints, inflation, the war in Ukraine and a tight labor market. While the company has cut costs such as downsizing its San Francisco office and rolled out programs to encourage more ridership and raise its bottom line, the company still wasnt able to capture the demand needed to make profit and loss figures work, he said, according to an audio recording of the event shared with TechCrunch. Lucas Beard, Spins VP of growth and marketing, also confirmed the layoffs and the decision to leave Canada. While it\u2019s impossible for us to predict the future in such a new industry, what we can promise is that we\u2019ll continue to be as transparent and thoughtful as possible as we continue to evaluate our financial performance and external market conditions, Beard wrote in an email. He added that Spin is also centralizing some areas with parent company Tier. The layoffs come about six months after Berlin-based micromobility operator Tier Mobility acquired Spin from automaker Ford. The acquisition marked Tiers move into North America and came after an aggressive expansion in Europe that included buying e-scooter company Wind Mobility\u2019s Italian subsidiary and bike-share startup Nextbike. The Spin acquisition gave Tier a global footprint of more than 520 cities and communities in 21 countries. It also added to its costs and ultimately led Tier to restructure. In August, Tier laid off about 16% of its workforce, or 180 people, due to economic conditions and a tightening funding climate. The VC firms once gladly forked over funds to shared micromobility startups even as costs piled up and questions loomed about whether shared scooters and e-bikes could ever be profitable enterprises. In the past year, micromobility companies still reliant on external funding have found a less receptive VC community. Bird, Superpedestrian and Voi are a few that have laid off workers in 2022. The lack of demand in some markets \u2014 including ones that once were teeming with users before the COVID pandemic \u2014 has forced companies to restructure their businesses and seek ways to cut costs. Clarification: This article has been been update to reflect the nature of Spins relationship with Seattle. The company was not granted a permit to continue its scootershare in the city in 2023, but was granted to operate a bikeshare. Micromobility is fun, but perhaps that\u2019s all it\u2019ll ever be"

        "Extracted Article": "Truepill, a platform that helps other companies offer diagnostics, telehealth services and prescriptions, has conducted its fourth layoff of the year. Sources say the layoff impacted around 65% of the existing staff across the engineering, human resources, design, IT and finance teams. The layoff comes around two months after its last round, which sources say impacted about a third of the company, or 175 people. Update 10/06/22: After publication of this story, Truepill chief growth officer, Doreen Bortel, reached out with a series of corrections regarding the layoff figures. First, Bortel said that the fourth round of layoff impacted 20% of staff, a figure that only counts full-time, regular employees across all departments including vice presidents and above. The third round, Bortel says, impacted 8% of the then-headcount, not 33%. Neither figure includes contractors. One employee, who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity, said that they were told that their position was \u201cno longer sustainable due to economic factors\u201d on a 1:1 call with leadership. Severance was mentioned but HR has not yet reached out to the employee with further details. \u201c[The company said] it hoped there wasn\u2019t going to be any layoffs after the August round,\u201d the source said. \u201c[Leadership said that] investors made some requests in order for the company to extend the financial runway so they made tough choices, but that we were now on good footing.\u201d A company-wide all hands, previously scheduled for this week, has been bumped to next week, the source added. A troubling startup layoff trend has emerged In April, Truepill halted prescriptions to ADHD medications because of growing concerns about digital health. The disruption in service impacted employees within Truepill\u2019s recently acquired adult ADHD treatment company, Ahead. Reports say that Truepill was the preferred pharmacy partner of Cerebral, which is under federal investigation amid claims that employees felt pressure to prescribe drugs to customers. In June, Sid Viswanathan confirmed that he laid off an additional 15% of staff, impacting 150 people. Viswanathan said in a letter that the company was \u201cfocused on defining a new category in healthcare and growing top-line revenue,\u201d but what was essential is the company operates \u201cwith a new level of financial discipline and prioritization, ensuring the longevity of Truepill for both our clients and our teams.\u201d In August, Truepill\u2019s entire U.K. team was laid off, as well as a meaningful portion of the virtual pharmacy platform\u2019s product team, sources told TechCrunch. The data team was also impacted, while the diagnostics and telehealth components of the company \u2014 its core services \u2014 will be only lightly supported going forward. Truepill says these services have always been ancillary to the business. Today\u2019s layoff impacts a number of teams, including the support engineering team that was tasked in picking up the U.K. team\u2019s work after they were let go.

        "Extracted Article": "Twilio today announced that it will lay off 11% of its workforce between 800 and 900 people across its staff of over 7,800 as the customer engagement platform looks to rein in costs during the broader economic downturn. In a message to staff, CEO Jeff Lawson called the layoffs wise and necessary, blaming them partially on Twilios rapid growth over the last several years and [lack of focus] on key priorities. I take responsibility for those decisions, as well as the difficult decision to do this layoff, Lawson wrote in a letter sent internally and published to Twilios blog. Twilio has always been a growth company. And as you know, were committed to being a profitable growth company. At our scale, being profitable will make us stronger We ultimately found that some investments no longer make sense and identified areas where we can be more efficient. According to Lawson, the cuts will mostly impact areas of go-to-market, R&amp;D and Twilios general and administrative departments. Employees affected who were notified this morning will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, as well as one week for every year of service at Twilio, in addition to the value of Twilios next stock vest. Lawson says Twilios talent acquisition team will create a list that laid-off employees can opt into, to be shared with other companies that may be hiring and investors who know many such companies. Paperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the headcount reduction will cost between $70 million to $90 million, by Twilios estimates, with the bulk of costs being incurred during the companys third and fourth fiscal quarters 2022. Todays layoffs are about aligning our investments more squarely with our priorities, as well as running our company more efficiently overall, Lawson continued. No doubt, it will be a hard few months as we change the shape of our company for the opportunity ahead. As CNBC notes, publicly traded, San Francisco-based Twilio has been striving for profitability in 2023. The company nearly doubled headcount during the pandemic as the appetite for its cloud services climbed. In 2021, Twilio acquired data security platform Ionic Security and toll-free messaging services provider Zipwhip the latter for $850 million. But sales cratered as the world returned to in-person work. Twilios Q2 2022 sales growth was 41%, the lowest since the December quarter in 2017, as the company faced a cyberattack that compromised the data of more than 100 customers. In its most recent fiscal quarter (Q2), Twilio while exceeding Wall Streets expectations reported a loss of $322.8 million on $943.4 million in revenue. Shares were up about 1% on news of the layoffs; Twilios stock has fallen about 73% this year."

According to a tweet, Metcalfe joined the company in November 2021. Metcalfe could not be reached for comment.

Satterwhite did not dispute that the entire team had been laid off. Satterwhite would not say for what reason Patreon laid off its security engineers, but added that the company works with external organizations to develop our security capabilities and conduct regular security assessments. Following the news of the layoffs, security professionals across the industry began posting open job listings for those who lost their jobs at Patreon. Thousands of tech jobs, including cybersecurity, have been lost this year across the tech industry, fueled in part by over-hiring and corporate mismanagement. Patreon is a website that lets content creators offer monthly payment subscriptions for their customers in exchange for a 5-12% cut.

        "Extracted Article": "Last September, Egyptian startup Capiter raised $33 million in Series A funding to compete in the country\u2019s growing B2B e-commerce and retail space. Fast-forward a year later, the startup has laid off multiple employees and now its CEO and COO have been relieved from their duties after allegedly mismanaging funds. Here\u2019s what we know so far. Between June to July, several ex-employees of Egyptian startups, including Capiter, wrote posts about layoffs at their respective companies even though the employers never addressed them publicly. Other companies include OPay Egypt, elmenus, ExpandCart and Brimore. Some sources told TechCrunch that Capiter had laid off at least 100 staff in those two months. Others described a workplace with poor management and no structure and a company finding it hard to onboard merchants to its platform while running out of money simultaneously. The company had only a month runway as of August, they said. TechCrunch reached out to Capiter at the time but received no response. As a result, Capiter investors have been searching for potential buyers to absorb the struggling company in the form of an acquisition or merger. This information was further corroborated in a local news report where Capiter\u2019s Board allegedly said that the founders had not been reporting to the board, its representatives and shareholders during on-site in-person due diligence for a potential merger. Another publication stated the executives had refrained from appearing before the board of directors after internal disturbances and disagreements over their management method. Before Capiter, Mahmoud was the co-founder and COO of Egypt-born and Dubai-based ride-hailing company SWVL (the company, which went public via a SPAC deal last year, laid off 32% of its staff this May). With his brother Ahmed, he launched Capiter in 2020 as an FMCG platform that allows small and medium-sized retailers to order inventory, arrange delivery and access financing to pay for goods. Some of its competitors include MaxAB and Cartona in Egypt, and in Africa, Wasoko, TradeDepot and Chari. Capiter had 50,000 merchants and 1,000 sellers with more than 6,000 SKUs on its platform when the founders spoke to TechCrunch last September. In the interview, they said Capiter was on its way to reaching an annualized revenue of $1 billion this year. And like many startups in Africa and globally, Capiter hired aggressively last year to meet its targets. However, 2022 has taken an unexpected turn for many tech startups as they deal with uncertainty arising from increasing interest rates and other factors that have a trickle-down effect on venture capital. News of layoffs, flat rounds and cutbacks from startups in various sectors \u2014 especially those that raised a lot of money within the past 18-24 months, such as Wave, 54gene, Kuda, and Marketforce \u2014 have been more widespread despite the continent boasting a better VC total by the end of Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021. Egyptian startup Capiter raises $33M to expand B2B e-commerce platform across MENA B2B e-commerce platforms operate either asset-light or inventory-heavy models. The latter requires more capital and for Capiter, which employs a hybrid model, it\u2019s unclear how the company has exhausted its funds and is already looking to sell after raising millions from Quona Capital, MSA Capital, Shorooq Partners, Savola and others last year. Capiter\u2019s investors declined to comment on the matter but issued an email statement. \u201cThe Board and shareholders have initiated an internal investigation and therefore are not at liberty to comment on the news or allegations circulating the social media for the time being. The Board and shareholders are also working closely with relevant stakeholders, legal and HR teams as well as the legal authorities for an external investigation on this matter.\u201d Meanwhile, according to local reports, the company\u2019s chief financial officer Majid El Ghazouli will act as interim CEO. Mahmoud didn\u2019t respond to comment. Update: Headline changed to reflect founders\u2019 charge. Also, CEO Mahmoud Nouh, in response to the allegations, said, \u201cI deny the false allegations and that I haven\u2019t received any official notice of what\u2019s above [referencing the statement about his and Ahmed\u2019s dismissal].\u201d BharatPe founder Ashneer Grover siphoned off money, Indian startup says"

        "Extracted Article": "Kuda, the challenger bank based in Nigeria and the U.K., has joined the ranks of tech companies in Africa that are pruning their workforce. The news of the layoffs, which was first disclosed to TechCrunch by sources, was confirmed by Kuda via email, saying it laid off less than 5% of its 450-strong workforce, or about 23 people. The company\u2019s numbers are small compared to other layoffs that have taken place within Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem over the past few months, especially among startups that have raised vast sums of venture capital within the last year or two; for instance, Swvl laid off 400; Wave, approximately 300; 54gene, 95; and Vezeeta, 50. However, the event speaks to varied efforts startups \u2014 including soonicorns and unicorns \u2014 are making. It\u2019s not entirely a surprise, in Kuda\u2019s case, even though the company went on a hiring spree for designers in July. When Kuda held a town hall meeting last month, cutting down seemingly redundant roles and dismissing nonperforming staff to reduce costs and extending runway were topics of conversation in light of current macroeconomic trends, according to sources. Meanwhile, it was just last August that the digital bank, which provides zero to minimal fees on cards, account maintenance and transfers and is one of Africa\u2019s soonicorns, raised $55 million \u2014 money that it planned to use to not only double down on new services for Nigeria but also to prepare its launch into more countries on the continent like Ghana and Uganda \u2014 in a Series B round that saw it valued at $500 million. The company, having raised more than $90 million in total from investors such as Valar Ventures and Target Global, is also planning an expansion outside Africa to Pakistan. It recently hired Pavel Khristolubov, an ex-Tinkoff executive, as its global chief operating officer and Elena Lavezzi, a former Revolut executive in Europe, as chief strategy officer to oversee efforts in this regard and also grow its over 4 million customer base. Kuda, the African challenger bank, raises $55M at a $500M valuation As Kuda positions itself for pan-African and international expansion amidst an uncertain venture capital environment, it depicts the recent cut in its workforce as part of strategic steps for sustainable growth. \u201cKuda is currently making some strategic changes to serve its customers better and continue to make financial services more accessible, affordable and rewarding to every African,\u201d said the four-year-old company, citing reasons for the layoffs. Kuda said in the email that affected staff cuts were made across various departments in the company. Per sources, this includes growth, marketing and product departments.

        "Extracted Article": "African genomics startup 54gene has laid off 95 employees, or about 30% of its LinkedIn-sourced 290+ employees. A companys spokesperson confirmed the news after several sources informed TechCrunch of the layoffs last week. Founded in 2019 by Dr. Abasi Ene-Obong, the three-year-old startup seeks to address the gap in the global genomics market where less than 3% of genetic material used in pharmaceutical research is African. This is despite reports saying Africans and people of African ancestry are more genetically diverse than all other world populations combined. As one of Africas most audacious projects, 54gene has received enormous backing from the likes of Y Combinator, Adjuvant Capital and Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund (CAIF) and several investors who have invested $45 million in the company, including a $25 million Series B last September; a large chunk of the companys investment goes into its biobank (which now has a capacity of over 300,000 samples) and lab testing centers. African genomics startup 54gene raises $25M to expand precision medicine capabilities In 2020, 54gene saw an opportunity to make additional revenue during the pandemic as it turned its lab capabilities and re-positioned itself to conduct COVID-19 testing, which spiked in Africa when the company closed its Series A round. It was a big part of the companys operation; at some point, 54gene was one of Nigerias largest providers of COVID testing. However, with the significant decline in tests, many 54gene employees recruited in relation to COVID operations had to be let go, the companys spokesperson told TechCrunch. Multiple business functions supporting the COVID business line, including labs and sales departments, were affected. The virtual winding down of that business line led to redundancy in these functions, alongside data entry and sample collection officers who were contract staff. Other operational and technology jobs were affected as well. Like so many others navigating this current market situation, we are not immune to having to make adjustments to headcount and our financials, in order to remain competitive within the market, said the spokesperson, adding that the company implemented the staff reduction on August 18. The companys spokesperson also stated that 54gene will provide affected employees with statutory support, in compliance with local regulations, and in some instances, the biotech startup will provide additional severance pay, as well as health insurance coverage extended for a total of three months. Layoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations. 54gene joins a growing list of African startups that have had to resize their workforce in a bear market despite raising several million dollars within the last 18-24 months. Other companies include Swvl, Vezeeta, Wave, Sendy and Marketforce. African genomics startup 54gene raises $15M led by Adjuvant Capital"

A spokesperson for the company confirmed the workforce reduction to TechCrunch, saying that it let go of 6.5% of the team, or 20 people. The figure provided by Argyle does not represent contractors that could have been impacted by the layoff. A spokesperson declined to offer further details on the number of contractors impacted, if any, or what severance was provided to employees, if any. Venture investors to founders: Turn down for what? \u201cArgyles continued move upmarket, targeting enterprises instead of SMBs, requires a specific skill set and the company did make an adjustment to its team today,\u201d the spokesperson wrote over email.\u201d The same spokesperson said that the company is still on track to double its workforce by the end of the year, hiring for more than 30 open positions. While the spokesperson did not say it outright, the statement implies that it let go of people with more SMB experience and are looking to hire more enterprise-focused folks. The startup raised a $20 million Series A in October 2020, then disclosing that it processed 10 million user employment records per month. CEO and co-founder Shmulik Fishman said he wanted to disrupt the process in which institutions buy records from third parties and instead bring user consent into the mix. The goal is to give employees more ownership over their data and make the whole process more transparent. Fishman hinted at a love for Plaid in an interview that same month, even crediting the startup\u2019s name as a nod at other successful fintechs branded around patterns. Ironically, though, Plaid has quickly gone from friend to foe. Months after Argyle landed Series A funding, Plaid announced the launch of income verification services. This year, Argyle announced a $55 million Series B funding round and the launch of a self-service tool so that consumers can access their employment records with ease. The company then claimed it has experienced \u201c10x growth\u201d compared to its prior round. As of last confirmed, Argyle serves over 500,000 U.S. employers, including 60% of the Fortune 500 and \u201cclose to 100% of gig workers.\u201d In its early days, Argyle told FinLedger that its largest customer segment were companies focused on credit extension such as financial institutions, publicly traded banks, credit unions, insurance providers and any company that provides \u201ccredit extension in all shapes, forms and sizes.\u201d Six conversations that bring nuance to techs layoff wave"

        "Extracted Article": "Digital mortgage lender Better.com is conducting its fourth round of layoffs since December 1, 2021, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. The latest cuts reportedly affect all departments. Better.com is not exactly known for its tactful approach to letting employees go. And this week, the company albeit accidentally lived up to that reputation. Sources told TechCrunch that a list containing the names of some people who would be let go in a layoff scheduled for Friday, August 26, was leaked internally on Tuesday, August 23. This reportedly led to those employees being \u201cimmediately terminated\u201d three days early, according to a Blind post and to information provided by some of those affected workers. Better.com teaches us how not to downsize a company It is unclear at this time how many people in total will be laid off in this latest round, but one impacted worker estimated that it would be \u201cat least 250 or more\u201d and that they \u201cwill all be from the U.S. side.\u201d Another source said the company seemed to be \u201cgoing for higher corporate salaries.\u201d TechCrunch reached out to Better.com regarding the layoffs, and a spokesperson provided the following statement: We\u2019re making prudent decisions to adjust to market dynamics so that we can continue to serve our customers for the long-term. Additionally, the company is said to have rolled out a new leave of absence (LOA) policy that \u201cdramatically\u201d reduces the amount of leave team members are eligible for. The new policy was effective immediately, according to documents shared with TechCrunch. Those same documents indicate that for those already on paid leave, the updated policies will be effective as of October 1. A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the move was designed to protect the company and be smart about its future, adding: We\u2019ve taken a look at our policies where were overspending and have decided to reduce areas to better align with industry standards. In less than nine months, the company has let go thousands of workers, seen numerous senior executives step down and delayed a SPAC that it recently said it was still working toward. Notably, Better.com also recently announced a spate of new executive hires that no doubt were not cheap for the company. One source told TechCrunch that the company\u2019s \u201cburn rate is so high, there will probably not be enough to operate past December without additional funding.\u201d Better, along with others catering to home buyers, has been hit hard by the increased mortgage interest rates and challenging macro environment, as well as the questionable actions of its CEO and co-founder, Vishal Garg. Earlier today, real estate tech company Reali announced it was winding down operations and laying off its staff after raising $100 million a year ago.

        "Extracted Article": "Tier Mobility, the German micromobility giant that recently acquired Spin from Ford, is laying off 16% of staff, or 180 people, according to a LinkedIn post by CEO Lawrence Leuschner and an open letter from the executive that has been viewed by TechCrunch. Ultimately, we have to respond to the current economic and funding climate, reducing the number of projects and business lines we are focussing on as a company in order to accelerate our path to profitability, wrote Leuschner. Leuschner also noted that hes committed to helping those who were laid off find new roles. Tier has set up a Tier Alumni page with details of the people who are leaving to assist recruiters. While Tier has not responded to TechCrunchs requests for more information, the layoffs appear to span a variety of teams, mostly in Berlin, with the highest concentration of layoffs coming from marketing, market development and technology teams. Most employees were informed by team leaders in 1-2-1 meetings Tuesday morning, according to Leuschners letter. Tiers decision to cut staff is the latest in a string of tech startup layoffs that are particularly concentrated in late-stage companies that are finding the current economic climate a difficult one in which to raise extension rounds and grow into their valuations. Tier was previously valued at $2 billion. The transportation space has not been immune to this. In June, Bird laid off 23% of its staff, or about 140 workers, due to a dire need to tighten its belt and restructure internally. Last month Lyft let go of 2% of its staff, or about 60 employees, as it shut down its in-house car rental program. And this week Ford Motor Company said it that plans to lay off 3,000 employees as it restructures toward electrification. The news from Tier comes as the micromobility operator appeared to be on an upswing after raising $200 million in October last year and going on a startup shopping spree. Last November, Tier acquired Nextbike to double down on its commitment to offering e-bikes, as well as e-scooters. In December, the company bought Wind Mobilitys Italian unit to expand geographically. By March, Tier had acquired Fantasmo to bring the startups camera-based scooter parking validation technology in-house, as well as Spin from Ford, marking the operators entrance into the North American market and making it the largest operator in the world. All of those deals, aside from Ford, were likely primarily stock deals, meaning Tier didnt necessarily have to shell out cash for them, according to industry experts. We have moved away from the strong focus we had on rapid growth and geographic expansion that defined the first few years of the business, and towards ensuring an increased return on investment for our current footprint, wrote Leuschner in his letter to staff, noting that Tier had been transparent about three months ago with the team about the companys goals to accelerate its response to the current economic downturn and funding climate. We have also taken the decision to stop or pause specific projects and work streams that cant currently demonstrate a clear path to profitability, and we have shared these decisions with you as they have been made. Team members who were laid off will have access to severance pay, employee support in finding their next role, including help with CV, LinkedIn and cover letter writing, access to the alumni page, mental health support for three months of leaving the business and the ability to keep all office equipment and laptops for permanent employees. Tier is also offering equity and dropping its one-year cliff on ESOP for everyone hired in the past year. The company told TechCrunch that after assessing certain projects and directions that Tier would have to reduce or stop, it then looked at which roles would be unnecessary as a result of those decisions. To keep the process fair and retain as many people as possible, Tier applied a social scoring formula to determine where to make cuts. Different countries have different requirements when it comes to this but often this takes into account things like tenure, age and whether an individual has dependents, Madeline Ash, strategic communications advisor at Tier told TechCrunch via email. Once we had been through these two steps, we then also went through a process to skill match affected individuals against any open roles we have at Tier and Nextbike to see if these could be offered as an alternative to allow us to retain as many people as possible. This story has been updated to include information from the open letter sent by CEO Lawrence Leuschner, as well as further details into how Tier made its decisions on whom to lay off."

        "Extracted Article": "Stripe has laid off some of the employees who support TaxJar, a tax compliance startup that it acquired last year, TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources and firsthand documentation. The layoffs \u2014 conducted over the last month \u2014 are related to Stripe\u2019s decision to wind down TaxJar-focused go-to-market efforts in late July. Sources estimate the number of employees impacted by the workforce reduction is between 45 and 55 folks, at least a portion of whom were invited to take 30 days to apply to internal jobs at Stripe. TechCrunch reached out to Stripe for confirmation, and a spokesperson said the company declined to comment. According to LinkedIn, TaxJar\u2019s co-founder Matt Anderson left Stripe in July, followed by folks in the sales, marketing and partnerships teams. Anderson did not immediately respond to request for comment Stripe bought TaxJar, a provider of a cloud-based suite of tax services, in April 2021 to help its customers \u201cautomatically calculate, report and file sales taxes.\u201d At that time, Stripe told TechCrunch that all 200 employees of the Massachusetts-based business were joining the company. The goal of the acquisition was to integrate sales tax collection and remittance as a service, one of the most requested features among users. In July, Stripe went through a 409A valuation process that saw its internal valuation cut by 28%. The rich company is valued by investors at $95 billion, but the implied new internal share price is around $74 billion. While valuation cuts are often viewed as a negative event for a company \u2014 industry experts argued that a lower 409A valuation, which is set by a third party and is different from what venture capitalists measure \u2014 they make it cheaper for employees to exercise vested options. Stripe\u2019s new and lower internal valuation, explained Fintech hasn\u2019t been immune to the downturn \u2014 for evidence, you need to look no further than the stock prices of Block (formerly Square), PayPal, Robinhood and Affirm. Global fintech funding in the second quarter of 2022 fell 33% to $20.4 billion across 1,225 deals in Q2 from Q1 2022, per CB Insights, and declined nearly 46% from the $37.6 billion raised across 1,287 deals in Q2 2021. It\u2019s a similar story looking at some players within the startup world. On Deck, a venture-backed startup accelerator that invests in other companies, recently cut 25% of staff and scaled back its accelerator program. Then, months later, it cut a third of staff. MainStreet, fresh off of layoffs itself, underwent a recapitalization from some investors. The company was just valued at $500 million last year for its platform that helps startups uncover tax credits. Also, one-click checkout startup Bolt laid off at least 180 employees and counting across go-to-market, sales and recruiting roles. That move came just a month after its closest competitor, Fast, shut down due to high burn. In the late-stage world, buy now, pay later platform Klarna laid off 10% of its workforce, and then had its valuation slashed by 85% \u2014 from $45.6 billion in July of 2021 to $6.7 billion in July of this year.

        "Extracted Article": "The United States credit system as it exists today has been around for decades and many would argue it\u2019s long been in need of an overhaul. In the meantime, a number of startups have emerged in recent years to offer consumers more options when obtaining credit. Petal is one such company. The New York-based startup, which offers three Visa credit card products aimed at underserved consumers, has said its goal is to help people \u201cbuild credit, not debt.\u201d It does this by using cash flow underwriting to help assess applicants creditworthiness and also using credit scores when theyre available. To be clear, Petal is not itself a bank. Its cards are issued by WebBank, a member of the FDIC, but they\u2019re Petal branded and the startup manages servicing for the cards. (TomoCredit, which TechCrunch has also covered, has a similar model of underwriting based on cash flow.) Specifically, Petal offers what it describes as \u201cmodern\u201d Visa credit cards, along with a mobile app, designed to help people \u201cresponsibly\u201d build credit and manage their finances. Demand for its offering has been growing, with the company having added 100,000 cardholders last year, according to CEO and co-founder Jason Rosen. At the time of Petal\u2019s Series D raise in January of 2022, the company said it had 300,000 cardholders, and that it was \u201cdoing $20 million to $30 million in annualized revenue.\u201d By year\u2019s end, it was up to $80 million, and Rosen is projecting that Petal will become profitable sometime in 2024. A majority of consumers approved for Petal credit cards since its 2018 launch had either thin or no credit history when they were first approved, according to Rosen. Members who joined with no prior credit history have gone on to achieve an average credit score of 681 after 12 months as Petal cardholders, he said. Despite rising inflation and a challenging macro environment, Rosen claims Petal is not seeing rising delinquency or default rates this year, Rosen added. In fact, the delinquency rates for Pedal have actually been improving this year so far. And today, the company is announcing it has raised an additional $35 million in what Rosen is describing as \u201cstrategic financing.\u201d Part of that money will go toward spinning out the Prism Data unit of its business into an independent company. Rosen will serve as CEO of that new entity as well, which has about 10 employees, while Petal has about 140. Petal makes money in a few ways: from interchange fees; from interest if/when people carry a balance and from fees on certain cards. Its Rise card, which launched late last year, includes a $59 membership fee. The company did conduct a layoff, which affected about 10% of its team, in the third quarter as part of a restructuring, Rosen said. Prism Data essentially takes the cash flow underwriting technology the company initially developed for use at Petal, and makes it available to any lender, fintech or financial institution. Petal established Prism Data in 2021 with the goal of helping other businesses \u201cbenefit from cash flow underwriting,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cWe believed that cash flow underwriting had the potential to change the way consumer finance works across the board \u2014 not only in credit cards, but everywhere that creditworthiness is evaluated, from personal and Buy-Now-Pay-Later loans to auto loans, mortgages and more, offered by anyone from the biggest banks to the smallest fintechs,\u201d he said. Prism, Rosen added, took the cash flow underwriting technology initially created by Petal, combined it with \u201ca lot more data\u201d and developed it into a set of new products dubbed CashScore v3 that was announced late last year. The model, according to Rosen, was built using millions of anonymized, consumer-permissioned records from a variety of different credit providers, credit products and customer segments. Said Rosen: \u201cPrism\u2019s open banking products add material predictive power beyond traditional credit scoring models by surfacing hidden obligations like rent, BNPL usage and payday loans\u2026We think that Prism can become a really common infrastructure that everybody uses when incorporating open banking data into their decision-making.\u201d Valar Ventures tripled down on the company by leading the new investment. It was joined by Story Ventures (which was a small investor in Petal\u2019s seed round), Core Innovation Capital, RiverPark Ventures and others. Notably, Synchrony Bank and Samsung Next also participated in the financing as strategic investors. Petal declined to reveal its new valuation or comment on whether the round was a flat, up or down one. It was valued at about $800 million at the time of its last round in January of 2022 and has raised nearly $300 million in equity capital and more than $450 million in debt financing since its 2016 inception. Trish Mosconi, executive vice president and chief strategy corporate development officer at Synchrony, said in a statement that the bank has a \u201cdeep history of using data to make informed lending decisions and create faster, seamless personalized customer experiences.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Prism Data platform is innovative in providing differentiated consumer insights, enabling financial institutions to make more data-driven decisions.

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity giant Malwarebytes has laid off 125 employees, or about 14% of its global workforce. News of the layoffs began circulating on LinkedIn last week, with former employees sharing that they had been let go during big layoffs at the company. Marcin Kleczynski, who founded Malwarebytes back in 2008, confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch. One former Malwarebytes employee, who asked not to be named, told TechCrunch that it was communicated internally that 160 employees were to be laid off and that all departments within the business were affected. Employees were informed about the layoffs in individual Zoom meetings, during which they were told it was their last day at the company. According to one online layoffs tracker, most of the layoffs were made in the San Francisco area. Malwarebytes also has offices in Florida, Estonia, Italy and Ireland. Kleczynski told TechCrunch that the move to lay off some employees was more of a strategic reorganization than a reaction to market conditions. \u201cUnlike most tech companies, we generate positive cash flow to grow our business,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent months, we have increasingly refocused our business on SMB and midmarket customer segments in alignment with our mission to protect the underserved. \u201cWe are shifting our go-to-market strategy to prioritize growing in these markets, including expanding our channel partnerships and accelerating our momentum with managed service providers (MSPs). Unfortunately, this has meant revisiting our current enterprise sales function and recalibrating the sales organization.\u201d Malwarebytes, which started life when Kleczynski was still a student, helps to protect millions of consumers and tens of thousands of businesses to protect against and remediate malware, ransomware and zero-day exploits. The company has raised a total of $80 million in funding to date, including a $50 million Series B investment from Fidelity, which valued the company at $625 million. The security giant isn\u2019t the only cyber startup to face layoffs in recent months. IronNet, a Virginia-based network security company, announced plans to let go of 55 workers, or 17% of its workforce, in June, while Lacework, a San Jose-based cloud security provider, laid off about 20% of its workforce of about 1,000 employees the previous month. While difficult, these changes reflect a careful realignment of our business moving forward to meet the needs of our customers and will enable the organization\u2019s long-term growth, Kleczynski added. The cybersecurity funding bubble hasn\u2019t burst but it\u2019s starting to deflate"

        "Extracted Article": "Truepill, a platform that helps other companies offer diagnostics, telehealth services and prescriptions, has conducted its third mass layoff in a string of workforce reductions, sources tell TechCrunch. The layoff impacted about third of the company, or 175 people. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One source says that Truepill\u2019s entire U.K. team was laid off, as well as a meaningful portion of the virtual pharmacy platform\u2019s product team. The data team was also impacted, while the diagnostics and telehealth components of the company its core services will be only lightly supported going forward. Impacted employees were told that they lost their jobs via a Zoom call, and some were told that severance details would be shared in the next few days. Truepill\u2019s next chapter will be the pharmacy operations portion of the business, a return to form after Truepill\u2019s frantic COVID-19 product sprint. When Truepill first launched, it described itself as the AWS for pharmacies, powering companies like Hims, Nurx, LemonAID and other direct-to-consumer healthcare brands. Over time and various financing rounds Truepill saw opportunity in selling diagnostics and telehealth services. Eventually, it expanded beyond brands that serve directly to consumers and aimed at institutions such as healthcare plans, life science companies and providers. Today\u2019s move is in stark contrast to how Truepill characterized its business just months prior; then it appeared to be in a position of offense, the company claimed to be bringing in $300 million in revenue in 2021. In an all-hands with those who remain employed at the company, sources say chief executive and co-founder Sid Viswanathan spoke about the digital health company\u2019s need to raise a Series E round, or an extension of its Series D round, a $142 million tranche closed in October 2021. As part of that financing, Truepill was valued at $1.6 billion, officially entering into unicorn territory. In April, Truepill halted prescriptions to ADHD medications because of growing concerns about digital health. The disruption in service impacted employees within Truepill\u2019s recently acquired adult ADHD treatment company, Ahead. Reports say that Truepill was the preferred pharmacy partner of Cerebral, which is under federal investigation amid claims that employees felt pressure to prescribe drugs to customers. In June, Viswanathan confirmed that he laid off an additional 15% of staff, impacting 150 people. Viswanathan said in a letter that the company was \u201cfocused on defining a new category in healthcare and growing top-line revenue,\u201d but what was essential is the company operates \u201cwith a new level of financial discipline and prioritization, ensuring the longevity of Truepill for both our clients and our teams.\u201d With today\u2019s layoffs, the company is focused on boosting morale of the remaining staff. Per sources, Truepill will now conduct merit surveys for all employees to make sure everyone is being paid adequately. Additionally, remaining employees will also get two mental health days. Viswanathan told staff he will send executives to meet employees in-person in small groups. Just weeks prior to Truepill\u2019s layoffs, the company announced the hire of Paul Greenall as chief business officer, the first person to take on that position since launch. In April, Truepill hired its first CFO, Ana Schrank. Meanwhile, resources remain in flux for impacted Truepill employees. A Slack group of former Truepill employees shows that those impacted by prior layoffs are struggling to get clarity on severance payments and land access to healthcare coverage. Current and former Truepill employees can reach out to Natasha Mascarenhas at natasha.m@techcrunch.com, or Signal, a secure messaging app, at (925) 271 0912. Digital health unicorns need a checkup"

        "Extracted Article": "Weeks after laying off workers, supply chain startup FourKites has raised $30 million as part of an ongoing financing round, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing indicates that FourKites hopes to close the round with $80 million in capital, a substantially smaller amount than the companys previous round, which landed at around $100 million. FourKites initially didnt respond to repeated requests for comment, but reached out late Friday to clarify that the investment was in part from FedEx as part of a strategic partnership announced in June. FourKites, whose customers at one time included Coca-Cola, AB InBev and Walmart, tracks and helps manage freight shipments across road, rail, ocean, air and parcel. In an interview last year, CEO Matt Elenjickal told me that the idea for FourKites evolved from his time as a supply chain consultant, where he worked with enterprises that often struggled with the need for basic supply chain visibility. FourKites is by most appearances successful, having grown its network to over 450,000 couriers and hundreds of corporate clients. But it hasnt been smooth sailing lately. In early August, FreightWaves reported that FourKites would lay off workers and sunset Haven, its ocean shipping document management and tracking solution, by the end of this year. FourKites had acquired Haven in April 2021 to integrate the startups document management capabilities into a new product called Dynamic Ocean. But in an internal email, Elenjickal said that Havens software modules had proven to be highly unprofitable The real value in acquisitions comes in having one singular global platform for all providers and all data. If you don\u2019t integrate those systems, you wind up with a bunch of siloed platforms that don\u2019t deliver much value for the customer, Elenjickal told FreightWaves. The real value for our customers comes from having one cohesive, user-friendly solution, so we\u2019re very strategic about how we acquire and integrate. As is industry best practice, we sunset old acquired platforms after that integration is successful. FourKites let go nearly 8% of its workforce as part of the aforementioned layoffs, or about 60 employees in total. Most were concentrated in platforms that FourKites had acquired over the past two years but has now built into its platform, Elenjickal told JOC.com in an interview this month, including yard management solution TrackX. Elenjickal blamed economic factors like inflation, raising interest rates and unpredictable energy prices. Up until this year, it was growth at any cost, he told JOC.com. The valuation was growth divided by the interest rate. Now it\u2019s about the path to profitability. Not immediately, but we see this lasting 18 to 24 months, and so let\u2019s make we\u2019re shored up on the balance sheet. The supply chain industry has taken a hit in recent months as the economic situation shows no signs of turning around. FourKites rivals Sendy and Project44 let go of a portion of their workforces this summer, as did well-capitalized supply chain and logistics vendors including Stord, Convoy, Slync.io and FarEye. Its a reversal of fortunes for a segment once seemingly immune to the macroeconomic headwinds. Just last year, funding for venture-backed supply chain management companies reached an all-time high of $11.3 billion, according to Crunchbase."

        "Extracted Article": "Kenyan retail B2B and end-to-end distribution platform Marketforce laid off a chunk of its workforce in July, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email sent from Marketforce CEO Tesh Mbaabu and obtained by TechCrunch, the layoffs were a part of a reorganization strategy in Kenya, one of its five markets which include Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. Mbaabu confirmed the news on a call with TechCrunch, adding that the company let go of 54 people. Marketforce had more than 600 employees before the event last month, so about 9% of its overall workforce was affected, mainly from field sales, supply chain and customer experience departments. Some of these roles were instrumental to Marketforce\u2019s growth over the past year as the company concentrated its efforts on onboarding thousands of merchants to its RejaReja platform. However, they had become redundant now that the company wants to drive more revenue per merchant, said the CEO. \u201cWe were at the phase where we were focused on growth, but we\u2019ve gotten to a point where we\u2019re optimizing towards profitability,\u201d he added. This February, Marketforce raised a $40 million Series A in debt and equity (equally shared across the board) from V8 Capital Partners, Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, VU Venture Partners, Vastly Valuable Ventures and Uncovered Fund. Mbaabu founded the company with Mesongo Sibuti in 2018 as a SaaS platform for retail distribution. Two years later, the company launched RejaReja, its asset-light merchant super app and marketplace that informal traders can use to source goods directly from manufacturers and distributors, make and pay for orders digitally and accept payments for utility bills. Since its launch, RejaReja has grown exponentially, with more than 87,000 orders made through the platform at an average basket value of $151. With a 40% month-on-month growth, it expected to record over $60 million in annualized transaction volumes at the end of last year, the company told TechCrunch this February. Theres been progress on these fronts: the platform has recorded over 450,000 orders, recorded $200 million+ in annualized transaction volumes and experienced a 20% month-on-month growth this year. Some of its competitors include players such as Wasoko, TradeDepot and Omnibiz. Last year, the four-year-old company said it would introduce buy now, pay later (BNPL) options to help merchants access fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) on credit. Marketforce also highlighted expansion into more markets across East and West Africa; however, those plans might be on hold for the time being following this restructuring move in Kenya. Sources also implied that Marketforce might be struggling with its business as suppliers have begun pulling out. Mbaabu brushed the claims aside by saying, \u201cas part of optimizing for sustainability, we are driving more consignment-based operations and optimizing for high-margin SKUs, meaning less suppliers overall.\u201d MarketForce raises $40 million Series A, introduces BNPL merchant stock financing Mbaabu, in the email, reassured employees that the company still has enough arsenal in its coffers and attributed the company\u2019s decision to \u201cadapting to the global economic uncertainties\u201d and \u201coptimizing the business for different growth metrics.\u201d Some roles in the Kenya market will become redundant, and new ones will emerge; all our other markets will not be impacted, he said. According to the CEO, Marketforce has commenced hires in Tanzania to scale its RejaReja product; before now, businesses in the country only had access to the SaaS platform. To employees impacted by the reorganization, Marketforce said it will: Offer you counseling services on navigating change and managing anxiety during uncertain times. Offer a training session on revamping your CV, optimizing your LinkedIn profile and interview preparation techniques. Partner with recruiters who will consider you for opportunities within other organizations that are looking to hire. Offer a certificate of service and letter of recommendation as appropriate. Pay you in lieu of notice in addition to a severance package of 15 days for every completed year of service and unutilised leave days. \u201cTo be clear, it is a path to profitability conversation. I think for a lot of people, even internally, it was hard for them to understand why we\u2019ve raised money and have cash but still conduct layoffs,\u201d the chief executive commented on how employees took the news. \u201cBut any additional month spent with redundant staff means cutting your runway short. And so, I think that at the end of the day, you need to think about how you conduct layoffs in a humane way. But also ensure that the company\u2019s best interest is at heart.\u201d Layoffs from the African tech scene have been few compared to the rest of the world. Last week, news of Kenyan logistics platform Sendy laying off employees made the rounds, adding to earlier reports from Swvl, Vezeeta and Wave. This, and the fact that funding data shows the African ecosystem has already seen inflows of around $3 billion in the first half of this year, way more than what the continent raised by this time last year, has compelled many onlookers to express optimism about the region\u2019s chances of coming out of this bear run unscathed. But while the African tech scene has emerged as one of the most popular tech markets in the world, bustling with opportunities, it might begin to witness a rapidly changing landscape, particularly in the second half of this year as more startups raise bridge rounds, trim staff size and accept lesser valuations. \u201cThe moment of truth will be the end of the summer,\u201d Max Cuvellier, co-founder of The Big Deal, told TechCrunch in a June interview. \u201cAugust [and] September in particular because this is when we saw a boom last year.\u201d Kenyas MarketForce raises $2M, plans to focus on its B2B retail marketplace RejaReja As the global venture capital market slows, Africa charts its own course"

        "Extracted Article": "Haus launched in 2019 as an answer to a generation\u2019s craving for a more transparent alcohol brand, raising millions in venture funding from angels such as Casey Neistat, Away co-founder Jen Rubio and funds including Homebrew, Haystack Ventures, Coatue, Shrug Capital and Worklife Ventures. Haus has raised $17 million on rolling SAFE notes to date. Today, CEO and co-founder Helena Price Hambrecht tapped into the same ethos of transparency to announce that the startup\u2019s Series A fell through and the company is in the process of closing down. In an interview with TechCrunch, Hambrecht spoke about Haus\u2019s transition from buzzy VC-backed startup to a business currently up for sale, as-is or in parts. Haus sells a series of citrus, spice and flowery low ABV (alcohol by volume) aperitifs, meant to be an alternative to hard liquors and a little stronger than wines. Made in Sonoma, California, Haus also promised a product made of all-natural ingredients with a key differentiator: users could order it online and get Haus bottles delivered to their doorstep. A digital-friendly, healthier alternative that replaces wine memberships set up the company to have a strong social presence. Hambrecht, a Silicon Valley branding veteran, took over as sole chief executive of the company in 2021 after her co-founder and former husband Woody parted ways. This year, Haus shared it has crossed the $10 million in revenue threshold and recently announced that it would be hitting national distribution with Winebow, another milestone for the then solely direct-to-consumer business. Yet, as the pandemic spread throughout the world, the company went through a series of challenges, including supply chain issues, lack of in-person word of mouth growth and iOS changes. It was difficult to build the business that I wanted to build during the pandemic considering we were building a social product, Hambrecht said. We didnt have people gathering, we didnt have natural word of mouth. We were a purely digital growth brand during that time, great for acquisition but not good for monitoring long-term behavior. The progress came as Hambrecht struggled to raise venture capital funding, largely, she says, because venture investors are unable to back alcohol companies due to vice clauses in their LP agreements. \u201cDiligence for an alcohol round is very different from software; with software it is 4-6 weeks, with alcohol it is months. I\u2019ve learned over time that almost every process, from operating legally to fundraising diligence, is 100x harder for alcohol,\u201d Hambrecht told TechCrunch. Because the company was unable to fundraise from traditional VC, it took on debt financing and began looking for private equity and strategic partners. Enter Constellation Brands, the producer and marketer of beer brands such as Corona Light, Modelo Especial and Pacifico. In 2018, the beverage company\u2019s venture arm committed $100 million investment in women-led startups. Constellation\u2019s dedicated fund stood out to Hambrecht because it, alongside the Winebow deal, would help expand the brand\u2019s distribution. Hambrecht says that Constellation committed to leading the startup\u2019s $10 million Series A, and even offered to advance the startup money as runway began to dwindle. Then, last minute, Constellation backed out of the deal without any specific reasoning other than \u201ctiming,\u201d she says. TechCrunch reached out to a Constellation spokesperson for further comment but did not immediately hear back. \u201cHere\u2019s a Haus update that\u2019s not fun to share,\u201d Hambrecht said on Twitter on Monday morning. \u201cOur lead investor recently declined to move forward with our Series A that we were in the process of closing. Without them, we do not have the cash to support continued operations at this time.\u201d Now, Haus only has one month to sell and ship products. It is no longer manufacturing new products, but that may resume, it says. We were just beginning to see gathering come back, and I was looking forward to that new chapter. The co-founder said \u201cthere\u2019s no villain\u201d in the shutdown story, yet Constellation\u2019s dropout shows another example of how difficult it is to be a venture-backed, direct-to-consumer company. When Haus announced its $4.5 million seed round, Hambrecht described the company as Glossier for Alcohol; fast-forward, and Glossier, too, has had its fair share of struggles. Despite the current situation, the co-founder doesn\u2019t think that going the venture route was a mistake. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the funding we did have, and what we were able to do with it. You build the company you want to see in the world and you know it is going to cost a little more upfront.\u201d Instead, she says that if she were going to focus on becoming a more self-sufficient startup or run operations off of its cash flow she would have had to make that decision a year ago. As a result of the fallen Series A deal, Haus is currently for sale via an ABC process, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors process that is a voluntary alternative to filing a formal bankruptcy claim. At its peak last year, Haus had 30 employees; now only four work alongside Hambrecht, all as contractors for the firm. \u201cIt\u2019s always dangerous to be low on cash. We got there, and it\u2019s unfortunate, but I know there are many companies in this position right now,\u201d Hambrecht says. \u201cI have been sharing my work online for over 20 years now. Its definitely something in my DNA. If me sharing this process is helpful for another founder in a tough spot and considering their options, then it makes all of this a little more worth it.\u201d As for what\u2019s next for the entrepreneur, a Silicon Valley branding veteran, there\u2019s no immediate plans to jump into a new startup. \u201cMy goal, right now, is to be as helpful as I can to make this ABC process have the best outcome possible. After that, I\u2019m going to take some time to process the last four years; it\u2019s been so extraordinary, as well as brutal and traumatic; I\u2019m going to rest and process that.\u201d https://www.instagram.com/p/ChAU5DDLA2h/"

        "Extracted Article": "Chicago-based Groupon today laid off more than 500 of its employees 15% of its 3,416-person headcount according to posts from former employees on social media. The reduction impacted workers in teams including merchant development, sales, recruiting, engineering, product and marketing. Groupon confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch after the publication of the story. Our overall business performance is not at the levels we anticipated and we are taking decisive actions to improve our trajectory, CEO Kedar Deshpande said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. The chief executive says that the layoffs, as well as a reinvestment in marketing and initiatives that drive customer purchase frequency, will set the company up to generate positive cash flow by the end of 2022. In a letter to staff, Deshpande said that Groupon is reducing its North America sales teams to focus on self-service merchant acquisition capabilities. It is also re-organizing the company to focus only on mission-critical activities and leaning on more external support. In addition, we are proposing to reduce cloud infrastructure and support functions as we wrap up cloud migrations. Groupon is also closing its Australia Goods business, more than a decade after launching there in the first place. Finally, Groupon said that it will rationalize its real estate footprint to be more in line with hybrid work. Coupon-finding Groupon has grown to have steep e-commerce competition since its founding in 2011. Rakuten and Honey, which sit on consumers browsers to scour the internet to show related deals, have grown into massive companies. All the platforms make money from affiliate fees and revenue-share partnerships, meaning the more competitors, the bigger the fight for customer acquisition. A spokesperson from Groupon said that it does not view Rakuten and Honey as competitors because the companies are more focused on physical products, while Groupon is focused on experiences and services. Still, e-commerce tailwinds have changed as consumer spending changes in reaction to the market downturn. It\u2019s a hard time to be a growth-stage startup. Over the past few years, the number of Groupon shoppers has fallen sharply. According to Statista, 22.2 million visitors to the company\u2019s site purchased at least one offer in Q1 2022, down from nearly 54 million in Q4 2014. The layoffs, while substantial, aren\u2019t as large as the cuts Groupon made to its workforce in 2020. In April of that year, Groupon said it would lay off or furlough 2,800 employees as business \u201cdeteriorated\u201d from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the restructuring, Groupon phased down its goods category as it shifted to a third-party marketplace model, which had merchants assume responsibility for fulfillment and returns. According to its jobs page, Groupon has openings for 67 roles in teams across account management, engineering, software development and more. The company is trading at $13.89 at time of publication, down 67% from its 52-week high of $41.66. Its likely no coincidence that the layoffs arrived ahead of the release of Groupons Q2 2022 financial results this afternoon. Revenue was $153.2 million in the second quarter 2022, down 42% compared with the prior year, on just 21.1 million customers making one or more purchases within the last 12 months. The company blamed the transition of its goods business to a marketplace model as well as a decline in engagement on the platform. Below is the entire memo that Groupon says Deshpande sent to staff this morning: Team, I\u2019m writing to you with some tough news. Later today, we will publicly be announcing a plan to streamline our cost structure, which will include our proposal to remove approximately 500 positions globally. While we have discussed the need to streamline our organization as part of our strategy to transform Groupon into the destination for Local experiences and services, I recognize that saying goodbye to colleagues will hit us all harder than any words on a piece of paper ever can. We\u2019ve done an intensive analysis of our organization and business structure, and the actions we are announcing today were not undertaken lightly. The impact will be felt primarily across our Technology organization, North America Sales and our Australian Goods business. Today\u2019s news will be difficult to digest no matter how it\u2019s presented, but I want to share as much as I can about why we are taking these actions. Put simply, our cost structure and our performance are not aligned. In order to position Groupon to successfully execute our turnaround plan, we have to lower our cost structure. Over the last three months the senior leadership team has been challenging our current processes and automating how we work, both with an eye toward taking costs out of the business and improving our productivity. As a result, we are announcing the following actions to: Reduce our North America sales team and continue to scale our self-service merchant acquisition capabilities. As we transition to a self-service led sales organization, we expect to be able to onboard and manage inventory and continue to drive efficiencies for our merchant partners. Put forward a proposal to re-organise and align the size of our tech organization to our business needs, by focusing our resources only on mission-critical activities and leaning more on external support. As part of this work, we will also be exploring opportunities to leverage engineering centers of excellence to increase efficiency and productivity. In addition, we are proposing to reduce cloud infrastructure and support functions as we wrap up cloud migrations. Close our Australia Goods business, which runs on a different platform than the rest of the Goods business making it too costly and complex to manage on an ongoing basis. Rationalize our real estate footprint to reflect the needs of our new hybrid work model. The vast majority of these cost actions would happen this year. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to look at ways to optimize, like leaning into automation and streamlining our tech platform, two areas we\u2019ve made significant progress in over the last three months as teammates stepped up and challenged our current processes. We will also continue to review our cost structure in other areas and ensure it\u2019s aligned with the size of our current business, while still giving us room to grow. To those impacted by today\u2019s news For those of you whose roles are impacted today, we\u2019re sincerely grateful for all of the contributions that you have made and want to do our best to support your success in the next steps of your career. For certain employees in International, you will be notified of our proposed changes and will enter into a consultation phase over the coming days and weeks. Where possible, we will be giving departing employees the option to keep their laptops, offer outplacement services as an additional resource, and where legally permitted, provide the opportunity to submit their information into a Groupon Talent List that we will be sharing on LinkedIn. We will be notifying affected employees directly throughout the day today, some we are asking to stay on for a period of time to assist with the transition. All impacted employees will receive information from HR regarding severance and other details on benefits to support you over the next weeks and months. Looking Ahead I joined Groupon because I truly believe that our marketplace is special: a place that helps people create core memories and forge new connections that can last a lifetime. Today, my conviction that the Groupon marketplace can become the destination for local experiences and services is as strong as ever. We are well positioned to transform our company and we are laying the foundation for growth. Together, we can create a fundamentally better experience for our customers and merchants. We\u2019ll continue to discuss today\u2019s actions and our transformation in the coming days: as a reminder we\u2019ll be hosting a Global All Hands meeting this Wednesday at 9:30am CT / 3:30pm BST / 4:30pm CEST to answer any questions, which you can submit in advance via this form. In addition, your STeam leaders will also be bringing their orgs together to host short, informal town halls over the next few days. Thank you for your continued commitment to Groupon. Kedar Deshpande CEO"

        "Extracted Article": "On Deck, a tech company that connects founders to each other, capital and advice, has conducted another round of layoffs just three months after laying off a quarter of its staff. Sources say that more than 100 people were impacted by the workforce reduction, accounting for half of the entire staff, while the company which confirmed the layoff to TechCrunch over e-mail said that 73 full-time employees were laid off. When asked about the discrepancy in figures, and whether more people were impacted under a different employment status such as contractors, an On Deck spokesperson said that they have no further comments. The company is providing all those leaving the company with eight weeks of severance, three months of accelerated option vesting and three months of healthcare coverage. Those interested in hiring laid off talent can request access to a list of people looking for new roles. On Deck, not to be confused with small business lender OnDeck, is a company that provides capital and network support for emerging fund managers and founders. Launched in June 2019, the company first announced a Founders Fellowship and has recently grown to offer more niche programs on specific verticals. It\u2019s that broad focus that led to a need to scale back, based on co-founders David Booth and Erik Torenberg\u2019s characterization of the company. \u201cIn the past two years of hyper-growth, On Deck launched communities serving over ten thousand founders and career professionals. Our team worked tirelessly to expand and cover a large surface area,\u201d the duo wrote in a blog post addressing the layoff. \u201cHowever, this broad focus also caused substantial tensions. What weve always projected as a strength \u2014 serving multiple user groups and building flywheels between them \u2014 also fractured our focus and brand.\u201d The startup says it sunsetted several communities and the layoff impacted all levels and in all departments; although it did say that no executives were laid off, which contradicts that statement. Among the shuttered programs was a ten-week, $2,490 climate tech \u201cfellowship\u201d that kicked off in July. In a message to community members that was obtained by TechCrunch, Booth said the company would issue refunds for current On Deck Climate Tech participants. While we will no longer host live sessions or actively manage the program, you will still have access to the community, the co-founder added. On Deck is also spinning off its career advancement arm to \u201cfocus on growing learning communities for mid-career professionals who want to accelerate their careers.\u201d The operation will be led by a former community director, Mindaugas Petrutis, and serve On Deck\u2019s current Design, Engineering, Data Science, Marketing, Business Development and Sales, Chief of Staff and No Code communities. \u201cAllowing our founder and career programs to operate under separate entities, led by people who are super passionate about these communities, will enable each team to focus on the needs of their core customers and will ultimately lead to better outcomes,\u201d the company told TechCrunch in a statement. A spokesperson says that On Deck\u2019s career development business \u201cgenerates quite a bit of revenue\u201d so it doesn\u2019t need much additional capital beyond some seed funding that the company has already provided to start. The new company\u2019s name is still in development. Put differently, after serving 10,000 founders to date, On Deck is now focused exclusively on helping early-stage founders build to scale. Its other programs, namely those focused on career professionals, will be sunset or spun off into a new company. It contrasts with the tone that Torenberg and Booth struck during its last layoff. In an email obtained by TechCrunch, the co-founders spoke to challenges around the firm\u2019s recently launched ODX accelerator. \u201cIn 2021, we launched ODX, our accelerator. We saw an opportunity to stand up and try our hand at innovating a stagnant accelerator market. By many accounts, we succeeded in this goal,\u201d the email reads. \u201cUnfortunately, over the same time period, the market began shifting dramatically. A few months in, the capital and accelerator markets were materially different from where they had been when we started. These factors forced us to reflect and consider how On Deck would continue for the future, support our communities and ensure long-term sustainability.\u201d After the publication of this story, On Deck said that it brought its accelerator program underneath its founder-focused program, ODF. On Deck still backs startups, but at what it says is much more founder-friendly terms. Accelerator startups are offered $25,000 for 1% or up to 2.5% of ownership, compared to the prior deal in which startups were offered $125,000 for 7% of the startup. While the accelerator may have needed to scale back, On Deck did tease a return to its founder-focused roots in May. The company rebooted ODF, which helps founders scale their startups through IRL and virtual programming, as well as On Deck Scale, a program for founders behind high-growth businesses to understand how to become better leaders. Sources estimated that the first round of layoffs occurred because On Deck only had nine months of runway left. The startup last raised known venture capital funding in March 2021, a $20 million Series A round led by Founders Fund. The startup did not answer whether or not it plans to raise capital soon, but did say that it is well-capitalized enough to have its runway at over three years.

        "Extracted Article": "Its been a volatile year for retail investment behemoth Robinhood. The fintech company is slashing 23% of its workforce, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed by TechCrunch. The layoff comes just three months after Robinhood cut 9% of full-time staff. At the time of its last layoffs in late April, it is believed that Robinhood had about 3,100 employees after letting go of around 300 workers. Doing the math, a 23% reduction in staff would amount to about 713 employees affected, leaving roughly 2,400 employees currently employed at the company Robinhood did not comment directly on the latest layoffs, pointing TechCrunch only to a blog post by CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev. In that post, Tenev wrote that while \u201cemployees from all functions would be impacted, the layoffs are \u201cparticularly concentrated\u201d in the company\u2019s operations, marketing and program management functions. In the post, Tenev took responsibility for Robinhood\u2019s apparent over-hiring in the frenzy that was 2021. He said that the company last year staffed many of its operations functions under the assumption that the \u201cheightened retail engagement\u201d that was taking place would continue in 2022. \u201cIn this new environment, we are operating with more staffing than appropriate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs CEO, I approved and took responsibility for our ambitious staffing trajectory \u2014 this is on me.\u201d Tenev also addressed that its earlier round of layoffs \u201cdid not go far enough.\u201d https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people/ \u201cSince that time, we have seen additional deterioration of the macro environment with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash. This has further reduced customer trading activity and assets under custody,\u201d he wrote. Robinhood is not alone in its choice to conduct two rounds of layoffs in a short period of time; just seven weeks after crypto exchange Gemini cut approximately 10% of its workforce, the company cut another 7% of staff, according to sources. Robinhood also today released its second quarter financials, revealing a 6% increase in net revenue of $318 million on a net loss of $295 million or 34 cents per diluted share. That loss was narrower than its net loss of $392 million, or 45 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2022. Transaction-based revenue was down 7% to $202 million while cryptocurrencies increased 7% sequentially to $58 million. Robinhood also included operating expenses associated with severance and restructuring, saying that expenses will be $17 million in connection with the April restructuring and an estimated $45 million to $60 million with the August restructuring. In 2022, total operating expenses are still expected to be down between 7% to 10% from the prior year, Robinhood claims. Robinhood\u2019s stock price has been volatile over the past year, as well. At the time of publication, the company is trading at $8.90 after hours, dramatically lower \u2014 by 89% \u2014 than its 52-week high of $85. It\u2019s also down 3.6% after hours. Earlier today, the WSJ wrote that Robinhood was slapped with a $30 million fine by a New York financial regulator, specifically on its cryptocurrency trading arm.

        "Extracted Article": "Months after Sendy laid off 10% of its workforce, the Kenyan logistics startup is at it again, sending more staff home while announcing the decision to wind down its Supply service and solely focus on its Fulfillment service to provide a streamlined service for its business clients. Sendy confirmed to TechCrunch that discontinuing the Supply service affected 20% of its remaining 270 staff, about 54 employees the latest casualties of the funding slowdown fueled by macroeconomic headwinds. Besides, Sendy, which has pivoted to cater to businesses only, is yet to raise the $100 million it had targeted to get this year. On a call with employees, Sendy CEO Meshack Alloys mentioned that Sendy was far off from the projections it made the previous quarter and that changes needed to be made to hit the next ones. \u201cIf we look at metrics, we\u2019re headed in the right direction, especially our contribution margins, gross profits, take rates and EBIDTA,\u201d said Alloys, who co-founded the startup in 2015 with Kenyans Evanson Biwott, Don Okoth and American Malaika Judd. \u201cHowever, the gap between where we are today and where we\u2019re supposed to be is still huge. To put that into context, if you look at the last three months from a GMV perspective, we\u2019re only 65% of where we need to be. And from a revenue perspective about 44%. So the gap is quite huge. And we need to do something about it, given the tough economic conditions we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he declared. Kenyan logistics startup Sendy cuts 10% of its workforce Alloys, while highlighting other reasons why the company is exiting supply and doubling down on its fulfillment arm, said Sendy Fulfillment is a core product with a bigger addressable market and, unlike its Supply product, wasn\u2019t affected by price fluctuations. \u201cWith the growing uptake of digital commerce and recognizing the opportunities it presents for businesses, we are doubling down on fulfillment to support online merchants with the necessary tools to sell and fulfill directly through digital platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the potential of digital commerce, therefore Sendy will now sharpen its focus and invest resources in building fulfillment and transport services for businesses.\u201d Its Fulfillment service offers storage, packing and delivery of goods, while the now abandoned Supply service made it easy for retailers to purchase FMCGs directly from manufacturers. Some companies providing such services across Africa include Wasoko, Sabi and TradeDepot. \u201cThis move is part of our wider strategic focus to consolidate efforts around solutions that impact more customers and speak to the current and immediate market challenges,\u201d Alloys commented. It\u2019s been a rough few months for startups globally. In Africa, some startups have shut down, like Kune, and faced closure, like Sky.Garden. Others have laid off employees or implemented salary cuts, such as Wave, 54gene and Vezeeta. While Sendy might be the first startup to publicly announce two rounds of layoffs in Africa, it\u2019s been a recurring theme among global startups; Robinhood, Gemini, On Deck and Hopin are a few examples. Sky.Garden, Kenyas Amazon-style marketplace, faces closure after funding fell through A troubling startup layoff trend has emerged"

        "Extracted Article": "Learning navigation platform Career Karma has laid off 60 people across its United States and global teams, CEO and co-founder Ruben Harris confirmed to TechCrunch. While he did not share the percentage total of those impacted, sources say a third of staff was let go. C-suite was not impacted by the workforce reduction, Harris said. The startup, founded in 2018 by Harris, Artur Meyster and Timur Meyster, links students to learning bootcamps and educational programs that fit their career and upskilling goals. The end goal of the startup is to on-ramp more folks into tech jobs, a world that we all know is under significant duress right now. According to sources, the layoff happened earlier this week and heavily impacted folks on the marketing and recruitment team. Harris confirmed that Career Karma now has over 3 years of runway to keep operating, without needing a funding round, following the layoff. \u201cWhat is different about this recovery is that it will be longer,\u201d Harris and his co-founders wrote to the board in an email sent to the company and its investors. \u201cWhile the timing of our Series B fundraising has prepared us for this moment, we have to assume that this recovery will take 3 to 4 years and stretch that cash for as long as possible.\u201d Earlier this year, Career Karma raised a $40 million Series B, led by Top Tier Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The startup has been operating since 2018 and has received checks from Y Combinator, Kapor Capital, Backstage, Emerson Collective, SoftBank and GV, formerly known as Google Ventures. Career Karma\u2019s latest check came as the platform sought to evolve from a navigation tool for those interested in joining a bootcamp, to an employer benefit that helps workers and contractors find job training programs that fit their needs. The transition from targeting consumers to employers meant that Career Karma was serving a stickier end-customer, one that would sign up large swaths of employees versus single customers, one by one. While it makes sense from a business model and impact sense, startups are also facing dwindling budgets and need to extend runway. It means that learning and development tools may be cut from the employee benefit suite, thus impacting Career Karma\u2019s ability to land new customers. \u201cWe are narrowing our focus to profitability of the marketplace and our enterprise expansion,\u201d Harris wrote in an email to TechCrunch. The company considered three factors when choosing who to cut: their financial impact to the company, how critical they are to the operational infrastructure and if skills aligned with the company\u2019s strategy. Harris added that employees impacted would have cash severance, three months of funded health, dental and vision care, and career navigation services. https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/when-do-layoffs-matter-trick-question-always/"

        "Extracted Article": "Publicly traded Lemonade has laid off about 60 employees of Metromile, the auto insurtech company it recently acquired \u2014 adding to the volatility the technology sector has seen over the past 18 months. In an emailed statement, a Lemonade spokesperson told TechCrunch that it was able to offer a role at Lemonade to about 80% of the Metromile team, but that as the deal was synergistic as it is able to operate with fewer people than were needed to staff the two standalone. Such staffing cuts are not abnormal in such business combinations, even if that is little comfort to those in eliminated roles. Metromile itself went public via a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) in February of 2021, with a valuation of over $1 billion. At the close of market on July 27, Metromile\u2019s stock stood at $1.05, valuing the company at just under $137 million. At one time, Metromile was worth more than $20 per share. For its part, Lemonade went public via a traditional IPO in July of 2020. That company too has seen its value erode from just over $188 per share at one point to $18.40 per share, giving it a valuation of around $1.1 billion as of the time of writing. Its stock was down 7% by midday Friday and significantly lower than its 52-week-high of $91.35. Lemonade announced on July 28 that it had closed on its purchase of Metromile, noting that \u201cIn return for under $145 million in stock, Lemonade receives over $155 million in cash, over $110 million in car premiums, an insurance entity with 49 state licenses, and precision data from 500 million car trips. Where did the layoffs land? On anonymous professional network, Blind, there was chatter that Metromile\u2019s CFO, an SVP, and \u201cmost of the product, engineering, and design teams\u201d were let go. Lemonade did not confirm specifics around who was affected. At least one software engineer posted about the layoffs on LinkedIn. Founded in 2011, Metromile launched its personalized pay-per-mile auto insurance a year later one of the first companies to apply that model. Its struggles on the public market have not proven unique; Root and other similar companies have also failed to retain value after going public.

The company had not widely communicated the extent of Mondays layoffs internally, leaving employees to speculate on the exact number of co-workers laid off in this most recent downsizing. A source close to the company noted that there was a reduction of 7%, or 68 members, in Gemini\u2019s companywide Slack channel Monday morning. Gemini has not yet responded to a request for comment. Some venture investors are doubling down on crypto despite an unknown recovery timeline The same source, who spoke with TechCrunch under the condition of public anonymity, said that the company was laying off staff due to what it described as \u201cextreme cost cutting.\u201d Last week, an internal operating plan document was shared around the office and on an anonymous professional network Blind on July 14, but taken down shortly after, the source shared. The document highlighted a plan that would take the company to about 800 employees, which was around 15% fewer than the 950 employees at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that at least one team member thinks its a good idea to post a snippet of our technology operating plan on a third party website (Blind),\u201d Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, wrote in a Slack message at the time. \u201cWow, super lame \u2026 if you are leaking company information, you are exhibiting a low level of consciousness and respect for your fellow team members who greatly benefit from the openness we are trying to create and foster here.\u201d Despite falling NFT sales volume, theres more underlying strength to the market than youd think TechCrunch viewed an image of the Slack message in question. Winklevoss also said that the message was a \u201cfriendly reminder that Karma is the blockchain of the universe \u2014 an immutable ledger that keeps track of positive and negative behavior.\u201d \u201cWe are going to the moon. We are going to need cosmic consciousness to get there. Earthly consciousness will not be enough,\u201d Winklevoss added. \u201cIf you are exhibiting the behavior of a first-time human, time to level-up or respectively bow out, if for no other reason but to avoid an expensive bill in the future.\u201d In recent months, a wave of crypto-focused companies have laid off employees. Last week, NFT marketplace OpenSea reduced its staff by 20%. A number of other firms including Crypto.com, Coinbase and Bybit also cut staff amid crypto market volatility. This is a developing story and will be updated if new information becomes available."

        "Extracted Article": "Wave, an African fintech that offers mobile money services in Senegal and Ivory Coast, laid off about 15% of its workforce last month. TechCrunch first got a whiff of the layoff news on LinkedIn, where Jessica Chervin, a former Andela executive who joined Wave as an expansion lead in March, wrote that she was leaving the company. \u201cLike many tech companies, Wave is adjusting rapidly to the jarring changes in capital markets in recent months and like the best of them (and importantly, as a financial institution), it has had to make very hard calls in order to ensure that it can continue to serve customers in existing markets now and long into the future,\u201d Chervin, who is also an angel investor, wrote. \u201cThis vital shift in strategic priorities means that I and many others are leaving Wave far earlier than anyone had hoped.\u201d TechCrunch reached out to Wave for comment on the matter and a spokesperson confirmed that \u201cclose to 15%\u201d of the company\u2019s almost 2,000 staff were let go. Thus, the layoffs affected almost 300 employees, most of whom worked in Wave\u2019s new markets: Burkina Faso, Mali and Uganda. According to a statement Wave released to its employees on June 30, the company said it was scaling back its teams in these markets as part of efforts to make sure it doesn\u2019t have to depend on new funding at a time \u201cwhen investors around the world are cutting back.\u201d Wave said its decision to pull out from newer markets will help it double down on Senegal and Ivory Coast, core markets \u201cwhere we are market leaders in mobile money with growing businesses,\u201d as it continues to serve its new markets. In 2020, Wave officially spun off from Sendwave, a remittance platform that WorldRemit acquired for about $500 million in cash and stock. The company, which operated a stealth launch two years prior in Senegal, has since raised more than $290 million in equity and debt capital funding to date. The firm, run by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, was valued at $1.7 billion at its last fundraise last September after it raised $200 million, the largest Series A in Africa. It was led by Stripe, Sequoia Heritage, Founders Fund and Ribbit Capital. The startup\u2019s other investors include Sam Altman and Partech Africa. Wave\u2019s platform is akin to PayPal (with mobile money accounts, not bank accounts). It runs an agent network that uses cash on hand to service customers who can make free deposits and withdrawals and get charged a 1% fee whenever they send money. The company is disrupting the mobile money industry dominated by banks and telcos with its app-based solution, cheaper fees and QR-based tech. And despite its continuous squabble with these incumbents due to eating into their market share, Wave claims to serve more than 10 million users monthly across its operating markets. Wave is the first unicorn out of Senegal and the overall Francophone Africa region. However, its staff cuts across its five markets, Tunisia, Kenya, the U.S., Germany, Nigeria and the U.K. The companys spokesperson said that a small percentage of the released employees operated remotely across these countries. \u201cThe people we\u2019re parting ways with are some of the smartest and most dedicated in our industry. Letting them go is one of the hardest decisions we\u2019ve ever had to make as a business,\u201d the remainder of the statement read. \u201cWe regret the impact on employees and their families, but we feel strongly that the best way to honor these colleagues is to ensure their contributions last. Wave is offering enhanced benefits and packages to all affected employees to express our deep appreciation for their valuable contributions, hard work, and dedication.\u201d As the global venture capital market slows, Africa charts its own course 10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully Layoffs have become the norm as rising interest rates and an extended bull run that swept across private and public markets over the last couple of years, among other factors, combine to make life difficult for tech companies. Amidst recession fears, investors are being stringent with their money, mainly toward growth- and late-stage startups. As a result, startups have had to cut costs and trim down workforces to survive; those who have had some success raising capital have had to adjust to pre-pandemic valuations. Big Tech companies have fired (Microsoft) and hinted at firing (Meta) employees. Small- to large-sized startups in various sectors, such as Substack, Hopin, Coinbase, Bolt, Byju, Twitter, PayPal and Tesla, have downsized too. And though it seemed, at first, that the knock-on effect would take a considerable amount of time before reaching Africa, news of layoffs from mobility startup Swvl and healthtech company Vezeeta made the rounds last month. However, just as the situation wasn\u2019t dire for Swvl and Vezeeta, it isn\u2019t for Wave. The Senegal-based startup likely has enough money in the bank for the next few years, and last week, it secured a \u20ac90 million syndicated loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Lendable, Norfund and other lenders in one of the largest debt deals on the continent. The loan, Wave said, will help it increase its customer base and grow operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast. SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going public Egyptian healthtech startup Vezeeta cuts 10% of 500-person staff Microsoft lays off a portion of its workforce as part of a realignment"

        "Extracted Article": "Fabric, a New York\u2013based micro-fulfillment company focused on robotics technology for last-mile operations, has cut staff and named a new chief executive. The startup confirmed the changes to TechCrunch, essentially saying that it has seen the writing on the customer wall and is making some strategic changes. Today, the company officially announced its intentions to move in the direction of being a platform rather than a service. As a result, not everything with the new plan is positive: founding CEO Elram Goren was replaced by COO Avi (Jack) Jacoby 2 weeks ago, and the outfit told its 300-person staff Wednesday that 40% of them would be laid off. Fabric builds hardware and software for customer warehouses to automate the processes of selecting, moving around and packing items. We last covered the company in 2021 when it raised $200 million in Series C funding with some top investors behind it, including Temasek, which led both the C and Series B rounds. The company raised over $330 million in total and its valuation was over $1 billion. In the past year, however, the company\u2019s customers began asking for different offerings than Fabric was currently providing, namely they wanted more of a platform offering than a service offering. Fabric\u2019s current service is providing the real estate, deployment, commission, label and all of the services to maintain it. Shifting to a platform offering puts more in the hands of the customer, Jacoby told TechCrunch. He joined the company in 2018 as chief of staff and rose to the ranks of CEO of the Israel market. In 2020, he became Fabric\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cMost of our customers told us they prefer to operate our system on their premises and with their own teams,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would like to retain direct relations with the end customers and do not want anyone between the retailer and customer.\u201d Fabric raises $200M at a $1B+ valuation for robotics-based fulfillment tech to help e-commerce players compete with Amazon Over the past 6 months, the company\u2019s board of directors and leadership began looking at what that platform offering could look like. Jacoby explained that since starting the company 7 years ago, Goren had a \u201cvision about building a network and providing a service to retailers.\u201d \u201cOnce the board decided it didn\u2019t see a demand for that in the market, that led to Elram\u2019s decision to step down,\u201d he added. \u201cI think after seven years, he was pushing in that one direction.\u201d Regarding the layoffs, Jacoby explained that as a service company, Fabric was providing the real estate, deployment, commissioning and once operational, the label and services. Now that it won\u2019t be doing all of that, the employees who were let go fall into those categories, which include its R&amp;D teams and are mainly based in Israel, but the layoffs were across the organization, he added. The commercial teams were not impacted by the workforce reduction because the U.S. is still Fabric\u2019s main market. Site operations, sales and marketing, product and finance were also not impacted. \u201cWe are going to expand in the U.S., but it doesnt make sense to shift R&amp;D to the U.S.,\u201d he added. Impacted employees will be provided with a cash severance, extended benefits and job outplacement services, Jacoby said. Though Jacoby says he is seeing the trend of a slowdown in e-commerce, it did not have an impact on the decision regarding the shift to a platform business. It was instead listening to customers and their need to shift to automation, owning their micro-fulfillment system and operating it themselves. However, e-commerce has indeed been slowing down since the start of 2022. Forbes reported that Americans spent some $5.28 billion less online in April with part of the blame being placed on higher travel and gas prices that are cutting into people\u2019s budgets for spending on goods. Jacoby reiterated that Fabric has \u201cyears of runway, is in a very good situation\u201d and was not under pressure to make the decision. \u201cWe are just doing what we believe will position us better in the market,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is happening to the market has nothing to do with it, and the companys financial situation is very good. This decision needed to be taken now because we need the runway to position ourselves better as a platform player.\u201d https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/heres-how-to-protect-your-equity-if-you-get-laid-off/ New data underscores a slowing e-commerce market"

        "Extracted Article": "ChowNow, a startup that builds branded online ordering systems for restaurants, today announced layoffs internally, TechCrunch has learned. According to several sources who spoke to this reporter on the condition of anonymity, around 100 people were affected across teams, including onboarding, operations and sales. We, like every company, plan our annual budgets far ahead of the upcoming year. The budget we planned for 2022 was large and ambitious. Since then the economy and capital markets have changed, and so its prudent that we adjust as well, founder and CEO Chris Webb told TechCrunch via email. We made the difficult decision to lay off team members this week. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and they will receive our full support during this time of transition. These actions are never taken lightly, but we believe they are necessary in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the company and our commitment to supporting local restaurants. ChowNow launched in 2010 as a way for Webb and his friends to easily order delivery and pickup from smaller restaurants without an online presence. The company powers branded websites, apps, and social media accounts for restaurants as well as its own mobile and web ordering portals. ChowNow takes care of payments and delivery through agreements with companies like DoorDash and local delivery startups like Jolt Delivery in Los Angeles. It also provides discoverability and marketing services, for example partnering with Instagram to make pictures and stories from restaurants shoppable by adding order food buttons and stickers to the restaurants images and videos. The Culver City\u2013based company positions itself as a friendlier alternative to incumbents like Grubhub and Uber Eats, charging a monthly fee instead of the per-order commissions typical of food delivery businesses. ChowNow also promises that restaurants on its platform retain their own customer data for marketing and insights. As of July 2022, ChowNow claimed it had over 22,000 restaurant customers across North America that were generating $2 billion worth of revenue combined through its platform. ChowNow has raised $64 million in venture capital to date, most recently a $21 million Series C round in 2019 led by 3L Capital and Catalyst Investors. Economic headwinds have hit the online food ordering space hard as investors pull back from what they perceive as capital-intensive bets. DoorDash recently shut down Chowbotics, a salad robot startup, just a year after it acquired the company for an undisclosed sum. Elsewhere, instant delivery company Gopuff announced this week that it would cut 10% of its global workforce \u2014 about 1,500 employees \u2014 and close 76 of its U.S. warehouses."

The company, which went public last year via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, said the restructuring plan includes a targeted 30% reduction in spending across the entire business. It anticipates the reorganization could potentially impact up to 30% of employees globally. The plan would allow the company to meet its targets through late 2023 using the $500 million of cash it has on hard. The cuts are designed to keep Arrival on track to start production of its commercial EV van in the third quarter of this year, the company said. Arrival added that it must address challenges such as supply chain issues, an ongoing pandemic, geopolitical tensions and rising inflation now as it starts production this year. The company will provide more details on the plan during its second-quarter earnings call scheduled for August 11. Arrival is one in a growing list of EV companies issuing layoffs and slashing spending as economic conditions tighten. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told employees this week in an email viewed by TechCrunch that job cuts may occur. Tesla has also laid off hundreds of employees. While Arrival is staring down a considerable reduction in spending and layoffs, it has fared better than many of its EV SPAC brethren \u2014 a group of companies that have faced SEC investigations, insolvency and executive shuffling. The company, which has centered its business plan around using microfactories to build its products, announced in May that its electric bus model achieved certification in the European Union with customer models expected to be produced by the second half of this year. Arrival said in its first-quarter earnings report it expects to produce 400 to 600 vans plus low-volume production of buses in the second half of 2022. The report also notes that Arrival has collected a total of 143,000 nonbinding letters of intent and orders for its vehicles as of May, including the commitment from UPS to buy up to 10,000 vehicles from the startup in the U.S. and Europe."

        "Extracted Article": "Airlift, Pakistan\u2019s top startup, is shutting down in a move that has sent shock waves to the nascent but fast-growing ecosystem in the South Asian market. The Lahore-headquartered startup told employees Tuesday evening that it will be permanently ceasing operations on Wednesday, according to two sources and slides presented to them. The move comes after Airlift unsuccessfully attempted to put together a new financing round, deliberations of which continued as recently as last week, said one of the company slides, obtained by TechCrunch. Multiple investors told Airlift that it will take them over two months to wire the money, the startup told employees. Other investors [were] unwilling to assume the risk of wiring ahead of others, the slide said. Airlift operated a quick commerce service in eight Pakistani cities, including Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Users could order groceries, fresh produce and other essential items, including medicines, from the Airlift website or eponymous app and have it delivered to them in 30 minutes. Instant commerce as a category has made inroads worldwide in recent years, but they also tend to be some of the most capex heavy businesses. The startup raised $85 million in the countrys largest Series B funding round in August at a valuation of $275 million, the highest for any Pakistani startup. Harry Stebbings of 20VC and Josh Buckley of Buckley Ventures led that round. Airlift is also the most funded startup in Pakistan. Airlift was attempting to raise a new round earlier this year via SAFE at a $500 million valuation, according to a source with direct knowledge of the event. Update: Airlift founder Usman Gul confirmed to TechCrunch that the startup is shutting down and provided detailed notes about the events of recent months. The startups demise could hurt the local ecosystems enthusiasm. In the past three years, scores of global investors, including Tiger Global, Prosus Ventures and Addition, have backed young startups in Pakistan, giving a major vote of confidence to the market. We were never their investors, but I\u2019m still sad for the people losing their jobs and who will be justifiably jaded by what just went down, tweeted Kalsoom Lakhani, GP at i2i Ventures, an early-stage focused venture firm in Pakistan. Im also worried that this will reflect poorly on Pakistan\u2019s entire startup ecosystem, which is unfair to the MANY startups building well right now, growing without compromising their biz fundamentals. Failure in any startup ecosystem isn\u2019t anomaly; it\u2019s inevitable. The more we leave room for failure, the more we also create room for successes in their wake. Airlift was widely seen as the poster child of the Pakistans startup ecosystem. Pakistans then Prime Minister Imran Khan publicly congratulated the startup when it unveiled its Series B funding news. As a pioneering technology startup in Pakistan that had established a new precedent, Airlift\u2019s success was viewed as a milestone for a burgeoning technology ecosystem in emerging markets. We believe that the ecosystem will continue to thrive and that some of the most valuable technology companies in emerging markets are still yet to be started, Gul wrote in a letter to staff Tuesday. My heart goes out to everyone working hard in the Pakistani tech ecosystem Airlift raised a monster Series B ($85M) &amp; was the poster child for the burgeoning Pak startup scene I ~really~ hope their failure is taken in context &amp; not as a reflection on the entire ecosystem https://t.co/DbaoLu4ksz &mdash; Ankur Nagpal (@ankurnagpal) July 12, 2022 Airlift says it will provide severance payments to employees in the next four to eight weeks and clear dues to suppliers and stakeholders. Teammates are not required to come to work beyond today access revoke will run by end-of-day Thursday, followed by communication via personal emails, the startup said in another slide, obtained by TechCrunch. Earlier this year, Airlift began expanding to South Africa, a move that significantly increased its expenses, a person familiar with the matter said. In a note to staff in May this year, obtained by TechCrunch, Gul warned that the market conditions had suddenly taken a turn for the worse as tech stocks reversed most of the gains following a 13-year bull run. Airlift needed to be extremely judicious in how capital is deployed and managed and was halting any new hires, Gul wrote at the time. He said the startups expansion to South Africa will remain in a nascent stage in FY 2022. In the note Tuesday, Gul said Airlift was able to achieve order-level profitability, maintain reasonable scale and reduce financial burn by 66%. As of July, 2022, Airlift was about three months away from operating profitability (i.e. positive cash flow from operations), and about 6-9 months from company-level profitability (i.e. Free Cash Flow), he wrote. It was also finalizing a new funding round when suddenly things well apart. With the above developments in May, one of our investors stepped up to lead Airlift\u2019s Series C1 financing. We\u2019ve received tremendous support from the potential lead in opening doors to other investors to put together the round. First Round Capital, Indus Valley Capital, Buckley Ventures, 20VC and other investors agreed to participate in the round with sizable checks, Gul wrote. In early July, Airlift had a clear path forward to close the round \u2013 the company pushed out documents for signatures to all participating investors. Last week, amidst rapidly deteriorating conditions in the global economy, several participants shared uncertainty in wire schedules and their disbursements \u2013 this ultimately meant that the company\u2019s capital requirements would not be met. Ultimately, the round was unsuccessful, he added.

We are writing to inform you [that] room service and catering services will continue as is. All collateral is still functional, the email read. We appreciate your loyalty to sticking with us through these times. The trouble was, Butlers roughly 1,000-person workforce had been laid off just days earlier. In fact, most were told that the company had been dissolved according to interviews TechCrunch had with a number of former employees, and corroborated in a report last week by industry blog Restaurant Dive. Butler\u2019s downfall is a cautionary tale both of the opportunities and challenges that exist in the world of on-demand startups. There may be clear gaps in the market for services that appear in theory like easy sailing. Yet they can inevitably be buffeted by economic, social and, in recent times, extreme public health headwinds. And amidst all that, those working there are the first to go over. On-demand delivery New York-based Butler was founded in 2016 as a ghost kitchen operator with a simple business model. Butler would lease a hotel kitchen on one property and use it to provide meal delivery services to in-house guests there and in other, nearby hotels. Butler founder and CEO Premtim Gjonbalic has experience in the hospitality industry. According to a Forbes profile, he opened his first restaurant in New York City at the age of 19 located inside a big-box hotel. Gjonbalic is also listed as an advisor to Fast Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company that unsuccessfully attempted to take Fertitta Entertainment, a dining, hospitality, and gaming giant, public. We are coming in and showing what the experience should be,\u201d Gjonbalic told Crunchbase in a 2020 interview. You don\u2019t need a cart in the room or a $20 service charge to deliver food. Guests want good packaging, a good menu, price transparency and to be able to track their order. This should have been happening a long time ago. Butler owned five different restaurant concepts that it staffed, including Standard by Butler (a casual bar and grill), Prime by Butler (an American brasserie) and Super Franc (a Tuscan steakhouse). Hotels could choose which concepts to have available to their guests; Butler handled the integration, experience, menu design and packaging. To customers, it pledged to deliver orders including convenience items on the side, like chargers and shaving cream in under 30 minutes, charged directly to their hotel bill. After a seed round and bootstrapped funding from Gjonbalic, Butler went on to raise $15 million in Series A contributions from The Kraft Group, &amp;vest, Scopus Ventures and Mousse Partners. The company subsequently raised $30 million from backers including Shamrock Holdings, Maywic Select Investments and Platform Ventures, bringing Butlers total raised to north of $50 million. In a press release issued last October, Butler said that it wanted to more than double its presence to 12 markets in the U.S., with plans to service rooms in cities including Boston, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh (expanding from its bases in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Miami, Denver, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.). The company said that Hilton, Hyatt, IHG and Marriott were among its more than 400 hospitality partners, which were big gets for the small operation. But some ex-employees say trouble was brewing behind the scenes. Signs of instability Butler no doubt took a hit as the pandemic depressed service and hospitality spending. In April 2020, the company received a $600,000 loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. But Butler, intent on expansion, continued to take on expensive new hotel restaurant leases. At one point, Butler was offering $500 prepaid Visa cards for every hotel partner successfully referred to it. Butler expanded its national footprint in 2021, hoping to capitalize on the travel recovery, Gjonbalic told TechCrunch via email. However, the startup found COVID-19 having both direct and indirect lasting effects, he added, among them labor and supply chain shortages, closed international borders, and continued delays of corporate and group travel. As travel recovered in late Q1 2022, Butlers challenges didnt go away, with inflation, geopolitical issues (i.e. the war in Ukraine), interest rate hikes and the bigger pressure on tech finance all creating a challenging fundraising environment for the startup. This led to commitments falling through abruptly, Gjonbalic said. But Gjonbalic and the rest of the companys senior leaders failed to communicate the severity of the situation, according to ex-staffers who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity. Just weeks prior to the mass firings, one ex-employee claims they were told Butler had no cash flow issues and that the next [financing] round was coming. Another says they were assured that the companys board of directors would give six months of runway regardless of how the next fundraise went. Some of the complaints have been more public and open. Kelly Buerger, a former launch manager for Butler, filed a class action lawsuit against the company in June alleging that Butler failed to give employees sufficient notice of their termination. Under the New York WARN Act and the federal WARN Act, companies employing 50 or more employees are generally required to give several weeks\u2019 advance notice of mass layoffs. Beginning on or about April 22, 2022, and within 90 days therefrom, [Butler] terminated hundreds of its employees, the lawsuit alleges. [Butler] was required by the WARN Act to give [Buerger] and putative class members at least 60 days advance written notice of their termination [Butler also] failed to pay [Buerger] and each of the putative class members their respective wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, accrued holiday pay and accrued vacation for 60 days following their respective terminations, along with other vested compensation perks during the 60-day period. Some ex-Butler employees who were promised health benefits through August received an email a week after the dissolution indicating their plans would been terminated early. Layoffs begin Butler began taking extraordinary measures to preserve its remaining capital. An employee at one of Butlers hotel customers said the company began discontinuing services and introducing new fees without advanced warning. For example, Butler began charging for deliveries that previously had been free. Early in the year, there was a round of layoffs at Butler fewer than 20 people that management described to employees as a one-time thing. A few weeks later, about 50 people were furloughed in what Butler internally called a response to challenges. We regret to inform you that due to circumstances faced by [Butler] resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the critical need to conserve our cash resources, we have made the very difficult decision to place you on a temporary furlough, a notice received by one ex-Butler employee reads. We are hopeful that [Butlers] financial condition will improve, and we hope to recall you from temporary furlough to resume your position with [Butler] by no later than November 9, 2022. The larger-scale layoffs started in May, shortly after Butler hired a new COO and chief revenue officer. The company dissolved on May 13. Gjonbalic claims that the board and Butlers legal counsel at Cooley, a Palo Alto-based law firm, explored several options to try to save the company, but ultimately decided to shut down and dissolve the company on May 12. On May 13, Delaware counsel was retained to assist with the shutdown and to liquidate the business assets and the employees were terminated on May 13, Gjonbalic told TechCrunch in an email. Butler is not operational. The board agreed to shut down the company, but this is not something that happens overnight, so several excess liability hubs were assigned or transitioned back to hotel ownership to assist with accomplishing this as quickly as possible. Employees laid off during the final round, which included operational staff working at Butler-leased restaurants, were informed in a three-minute Google Meet call. An ex-employee told TechCrunch that services stopped abruptly after the companys dissolution; guests at one hotel with a Butler contract were suddenly unable to order room service. Vestiges of the company remain. An ex-employee with knowledge of the matter said that people formerly employed by Butler were direct-messaging the companys Instagram account, which remains active, to ask about missing payments. Much of Butlers senior leadership havent updated their profiles on LinkedIn to reflect the shutdown, and Butlers website makes no mention of it. Hotel owners and hotel management companies took over most of [Butlers] lease obligations, and fortunately my dad agreed to assume two of the remaining lease obligations and debts off the company\u2019s hands, Gjonbalic said [in an email to TechCrunch]. An assignee is in place and he is handling all post-dissolution matters. Cautionary tale While an extreme example, Butler is hardly the only food delivery startup to have fallen on hard times recently. Instacart last month slashed its valuation by almost 40% and slowed hiring. Publicly traded DoorDash and Deliveroo have seen their stock prices fluctuate wildly over the past year. Gorillas, Getir, Zapp, Jokr and Gopuff are among other delivery startups that have let go staff in recent months, despite fundraising. And some have been forced to shut down entirely, like Fridge No More, 1520 and Buyk. Beyond foodtech, stories like Butlers are playing out with increasing frequency as investors tighten their belts, fearing a downturn. As one ex-Butler staffer put it, VC backers maintained an insatiable demand for growth, encouraging expansion that later proved to be foolhardy. Valuations became inflated, which caused unrealistic expectations and changes in direction and initiatives. Butler is a prime example of what\u2019s happening in tech right now except instead of just 20% layoffs, the whole company went under, the staffer said."

The layoffs account for about 5% of its more than 2,000 global workforce, according to sources familiar with the companys actions. The layoffs were widespread, affecting talent recruiters, digital media and communications employees as well as members of its operations teams, a review of LinkedIn profiles shows. Argo confirmed it had issued layoffs and said in an emailed statement, With incredible growth and progress made in our mission to deploy driverless vehicles, we are making prudent adjustments to our business plan to best continue on a path for success. One source, who remained anonymous because they are not authorized to speak on behalf of the company, told TechCrunch that Argo had hired too quickly, overshooting where it should be. The company is still hiring and has dozens of engineering, legal, technical program management and fleet operations positions open. Argo AI, which is based in Pittsburgh, launched driverless testing operations in May 2022 in Miami and Austin, a marking the companys progress toward commercializing its technology."

        "Extracted Article": "Outschool, a marketplace for kid-friendly, virtual after-school programs, has laid off 31 people or 18% of its workforce, CEO Amir Nathoo confirmed to TechCrunch over text message. The layoff, conducted last month, comes after a period of rapid fundraising for Outschool. The firm raised its Series B, C and D in a 12-month period, most recently growing its valuation to $3 billion after hitting a $1 billion valuation just four months earlier. The capital was used to help Outschool grow from an early-stage startup into a growth stage company. In October 2021, the company announced it had attracted over $100 million in bookings on its platform. Nathoo then explained the need to staff up quickly to meet unprecedented demand; growing from 25 employees to 164. Now, the co-founder said \u201cit\u2019s no secret that market conditions have rapidly shifted.\u201d \u201cWe recognized the need to be more defensive going into the second half of the year,\u201d Nathoo said. \u201cThis was one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in my career but we have tried to do right by some truly talented and amazing people.\u201d A spokesperson over email said that layoffs impacted all teams, including those at VP level, \u201cto ensure that operations continue to be optimized companywide.\u201d They also confirmed that 75% of the employees joined in the past two years. Outschool did not provide full details of severance but said that it was a \u201cvery generous package.\u201d The company asserts that it has over three years of runway, with no need to raise anytime soon. Still, the layoffs put a brighter spotlight on the challenges of marketplace startups and the difficulty of being a growth-stage company that wants to serve children. Months ago, when I asked Nathoo about the clash of incentives between venture and its core clientele, he said that we\u2019ve been venture funded from the very start, and I hope our actions, and how we go about our work reflects our values \u2026 the fact that venture funding hasn\u2019t affected the fact that we\u2019re a mission-driven company and values-driven company, and that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d Outschools after-school enrichment marketplace is now valued at $3 billion Outschool more recently has shifted focus from single customers to enterprise deals through schools or employer benefits. In the next five years, the company hopes that more than half of the enrollments on the platform are coming from employers and schools."

        "Extracted Article": "Modsy, an online interior design services company, has ceased to offer design services, a move that comes at the cost of the team behind the effort and customers who have orders in flux. In an email to TechCrunch, Modsy CEO Shanna Tellerman provided this statement when asked about the disruption of business: We have worked hard over the past seven years to build Modsy and never expected we would have to disrupt our business. Our focus has always been, and still is, on our customers. We intend to fulfill customer merchandise orders and we are working through a process for our design service customers. We ask for your patience as we work through this plan. I hope that for many people, the Modsy story will not be defined by this turn of events, and we are truly sorry. We would like to thank our team, our designers, and our customers. TechCrunch sent a series of questions in response to the statement including queries about the below information from sources but has not yet heard back at time of publication. Late last week, sources say that the company was expecting to be acquired but that the deal fell through, leaving designers at the company without a job. The potential acquirer is not known. Employees later found out that Modsy is pivoting to offer a SaaS platform, Modsy Pro, as a software service for interior designers. On Modsy\u2019s website, Modsy Pro is described as \u201conline interior design software that will transform the way you do business \u2026 bring your client\u2019s space to life with our proprietary room-scan technology, 3D renders, and easily editable and shoppable designs.\u201d The landing page offers a way for users to apply for early access for the still-beta product. Modsy\u2019s initial business model revolved around selling interior design services on top of an AI-powered platform. Using the company\u2019s apps, property owners could create virtual renderings of their rooms and restyle them in real time. The company\u2019s technology digitally replicated rooms in 360 degrees with furniture from well-known brands, including West Elm, Crate &amp; Barrel and Anthropologie. Users could purchase fixtures \u2014 whether a rug, couch or coffee table \u2014 either through Modsy directly or through partner tools like Crate &amp; Barrel\u2019s 3D Room Designer. Modsy had customers snap photos and take measurements of their rooms and complete a style quiz indicating their preferences, budget and constraints. Modsy forwarded this information onto designers, at which point customers got virtual design plans of their rooms. Customers could then consult with Modsy\u2019s team or fine-tune the designs with a self-service tool. Image Credits: Oracle NetSuite (opens in a new window) Just in March, Modsy launched what it called a first-of-its-kind virtual renovation design service for space types including patios and structural add-ons. The new service allowed customers to visualize home improvements before construction began, generating renovation designs for contractors, builders, and architects as well as finish, materials, furniture, and fixture recommendations. The new product rollout comes as operations are disrupted elsewhere, both at the cost of employees and customers. It also comes at a time of uncertainty. Generally, communication from Modsy has been inconsistent throughout the layoffs, customers \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity \u2014 tell TechCrunch. One customer had been in touch with a Modsy designer for about a week when the correspondence suddenly stopped. Then they received an email from the designer informing them of the pivot. I personally would like to extend my sincere apologies for this sudden business pivot, the message reads. For the majority of us here at Modsy, today is our last day. However, this is a small team staying on for a little while to help wrap things up with customers such as yourself. We are working hard to get everyones inquiries as quickly as we can, but please expect delays in response time. It could be a few business days before someone gets back to you. Furniture orders appear to have been impacted by the personnel changes, too. A customer told TechCrunch items were sitting in their cart as of the evening of June 28, awaiting processing. A second customer, whod been working with a Modsy designer since early May, was told by customer support that cancellations couldnt be processed and to try again later. When they tried to use Modsys app to cancel an order that wasnt scheduled to arrive until October, they saw a notification saying that all order processing had been halted. The same customer received an email from Modsys support team promising to fulfill all outstanding orders, including backorders. We are currently experiencing delays in the ability to process cancellations, but if you wish to cancel something, just let us know, and we will put you in queue, a support staffer wrote. A third customer TechCrunch spoke to had begun working with a Modsy designer on June 5. After several video calls, the customer received a note from their designer saying that they\u2019d been let go. When they tried to contact the designer for more information, they discovered that Modsy\u2019s in-app chat feature had been disabled. \u201cI have not received any information from Modsy except for [a strange email from my designer] yesterday saying she was let go,\u201d one customer wrote in an email to Modsy\u2019s customer service. \u201cOur project hasn\u2019t started yet, so I\u2019m confused and frustrated about what is going on. Of course, there are competitors, and I specifically chose Modsy \u2014 but we are moving into a new home, and I have a sensitive timeline that now is unlikely to be met.\u201d Today, some Modsy customers reported that they began seeing a prompt in the mobile app requiring them to \u201cupgrade\u201d to the latest version. But no update was available through the App Store, making the app effectively nonfunctional. Modsy support has been directing customers requesting a refund to a Google Form. Several customers were told refunds would take one to two weeks. Backers in Modsy included Comcast Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and NBCUniversal. The companys last funding round closed in May 2019, bringing Modsys total raised to $72.7 million, according to Crunchbase data. Modsy has explored a number of potential new lines of business throughout its history. At one point, the company even developed and sold its own furniture line, Minna Home, which spanned several different styles of sofas and chairs. It also launched a partnership with homebuilding company Lennar to create online model home tours. The company had a round of layoffs in the beginning of the pandemic, cutting a solid chunk of employees and contractors and slashing executive salaries. At the time, Tellerman attributed the workforce reduction to \u201can effort to maintain a sustainable business during these unprecedented circumstances.\u201d The April 2020 layoff also saw designers lose their jobs. Modsy took a hit on the logistics side during the pandemic as global supply chains ground to a halt. Amanda Kwan-Rosenbush, senior director of finance and accounting at Modsy, previously described shipping as a significant cost, and said that Modsy\u2019s furniture and d\u00e9cor partners struggled with long delays. As an article in Business of Home notes, however, the e-design platform space is no stranger to failures. Laurel &amp; Wolf and Homepolish shut down in 2019, and D\u00e9cor Aid, smaller company, shuttered in 2021."

The layoff impacts the startups teams globally, including in Brazil.

To realign with our business priorities, we are optimising our team to accelerate results and best position the business for long-term growth,\u201d the spokesperson said. The Tuesday development marks the latest in a growing series of layoffs among Indian startups. BlinkIt, formerly known as Zomato-owned Grofers, a struggling online grocer, online learning platforms Unacademy, Eruditus and Vedantu, cars marketplace Cars24, e-commerce marketplace Udaan, fintech Rupeek, social commerce Meesho and online pharmacy PharmEasy are among startups that have let go employees in recent weeks. Jobs of over 10,000 employees in India have been eliminated this year due to the market correction (or so has been the single most popular excuse), according to estimates. Investors in India, as is the case elsewhere, have significantly slowed the pace of their investments as tech stocks globally fall to a level not seen in recent years."

        "Extracted Article": "Vezeeta, a healthtech startup operating in the Middle East and Africa, reportedly laid off about 10% of its staff last week. The number of affected employees isn\u2019t known; however, multiple sources who posted the news on LinkedIn, including affected employees, revealed that up to 50 people were let go. Vezeeta has almost 500 employees, according to its LinkedIn page. TechCrunch reached out to the Egypt- and Dubai-based company for comment but didn\u2019t get any response at the time of publication. The last time we covered Vezeeta was in 2020, when it raised $40 million in Series D funding (the joint largest single healthtech round in Africa alongside Reliance Health) from Gulf Capital and Saudi Technology Ventures (STV). According to its CEO Amir Barsoum, the healthtech company has received $73 million in total and is generally touted as one of Africas and the Middle East\u2019s soonicorns. Vezeeta\u2019s business has evolved from the \u201cUber for Ambulance\u201d model it launched in 2012 to what it is now: a subscription-based doctor booking and consultation platform. As of 2020, it was operating in 50 cities across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon and claimed its userbase had grown 3x year-over-year to 4 million patients, with 30,000 healthcare providers using its software-as-a-service solution. But currently, the platform caters to 10 million patients across 78 cities (including Nigeria and Kenya, its latest addition) via three outpatient touchpoints: doctor consultations, pharmacy and diagnostics. Like many healthtech startups in the region and globally, Vezeeta benefited from pandemic-induced funding, and before this news, there was no indication that the 10-year-old company needed to cut costs. But if there\u2019s anything the current venture capital landscape has shown, no sector is immune to layoffs, as startups from real estate, crypto, q-commerce and fintech (among others) laid off nore than 16,000 employees just last month. https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/heres-how-to-protect-your-equity-if-you-get-laid-off/ There are a few notable examples in the U.S. healthtech space. Earlier this month, Carbon Health, a virtual care provider, laid off 8% of its workforce, citing the need to \u201cadapt to the changing market conditions.\u201d Last week, healthcare unicorn Ro, after recently raising $150 million at a $7 billion valuation, relieved 18% of its staff from their duties to \u201cmanage expenses, increase the efficiency of our organization and better map our resources to our current strategy.\u201d Other platforms globally, as reported by Layoffs.fyi, include the likes of PharmEasy, Sami and Truepill. Vezeeta is the first major player in Africa and the Middle East to be affected. The healthtech company didn\u2019t release any statements detailing what led to its decision or plans going forward, but affected employees stated reasons Vezeeta probably highlighted in its discussion with staff. One said the layoffs were a result of \u201cdisasters in the market,\u201d while another said it was \u201cdue to the global market crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.\u201d This layoff news is the second coming from an Egypt-born but Dubai-based company in quick succession. In May, publicly traded mobility startup SWVL announced plans to lay off 32% of its workforce. The company noted changes to its financial realities and the need to implement a portfolio optimization program to \u201cfocus on its highest profitability operations, enhance efficiency and reduce central costs.\u201d Layoffs hit crypto and real estate tech particularly hard this week This is not (just) another roundup of tech layoffs 10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully"

The exact number of how many people were affected is not known, but when TechCrunch reported on its last raise in May of 2021, the company said that it had 400 employees. If that is still the case today, then about 72 people were let go. When contacted, the company confirmed that the 18% figure was correct but did not specify the exact number. In a written statement, CEO Adam Hughes said: Due to the current macro-economic environment, we have decided to take some proactive adjustments to ensure Amount\u2019s ability to thrive for years to come. We believe these actions are the prudent thing to do for the long-term health of the company and remain extremely excited about the future. Amount was spun out of Avant \u2014 an online lender that has raised over $600 million in equity \u2014 in January of 2020 to provide enterprise software built specifically for the banking industry. It partners with banks and financial institutions to \u201crapidly digitize their financial infrastructure and compete in the retail lending and buy now, pay later sectors,\u201d Hughes told TechCrunch last year when the company announced it had raised $99 million in a Series D funding round at a valuation of just over $1 billion. In total, Amount has raised $243 million to date. Investors include WestCap and Goldman Sachs, among others. In simple terms, Amount\u2019s mission is to help financial institutions \u201cgo digital in months \u2014 not years\u201d and thus, better compete with fintech rivals. The company formed just before the pandemic hit, after which demand for the type of technology Amount had developed increased exponentially, the company said. At the time of that last raise, Hughes told TechCrunch that Amount\u2019s clients included financial institutions collectively managing nearly $2 trillion in U.S. assets and servicing more than 50 million U.S. customers. Hughes declined to provide any details regarding the company\u2019s financials, saying only that Amount \u201cperformed well\u201d as a standalone company in 2020 and that the company was expecting \u201csignificant\u201d year-over-year revenue growth in 2021. He did say that HSBC, TD Bank, Regions, Banco Popular and Avant (of course) were among the 10 banks that used Amount\u2019s technology in an effort to simplify their transition to digital financial services.

        "Extracted Article": "Ro, a healthcare unicorn that last raised $150 million just months ago at a $7 billion valuation, has cut 18% of its staff to \u201cmanage expenses, increase the efficiency of our organization and better map our resources to our current strategy,\u201d leadership wrote in an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch and confirmed by multiple sources. \u201cDue to our obligation to protect patient healthcare information, there will not be a transition period for those departing the company,\u201d the e-mail continues. \u201cWe know that this will feel abrupt and hope you can find alternative ways to connect to say goodbye to your teammates.\u201d Impacted employees will get two months of severance pay and support for job placement. The healthcare unicorn is offering two months of paid healthcare benefits. Ro confirmed the news to TechCrunch and provided a copy of the aforementioned e-mail that CEO Zachariah Reitano sent to staff. A spokeswoman said that Ro is still hiring. The layoff today, per one source, impacts most of Ros recruiting team. Another source says that the announcement was unexpected, and that current employees were told about the workforce reduction via Zoom without the chance to ask any questions. In the e-mail, Ro asserts that people who were impacted by the layoffs were told in 1:1 conversations. In the email, leadership says it took steps over the past six months to prepare for a possible downturn, including narrowing focus and raising additional capital. The capital theyre alluding to, despite being at a higher valuation, was solely funded by existing investors. The financing event was less than its preceding round. The absence of new investors signaled that the company stuck to people who already have financial stakes in the company\u2019s future success. Ro\u2019s decision to lay people off comes after a number of executives left the company, including Ro COO George Koveos, GM of Ro Pharmacy Steve Buck and most recently, Modern Fertility co-founder Afton Vechery. Vechery\u2019s departure, which happened around one year after her company was acquired by Ro, has been rumored for over six months \u2014 first sparked by an employee exodus that peaked last year. At that time, former and current employees spoke to rising tensions at Ro that were caused by the health tech company\u2019s inability to gain meaningful revenue from newer products. Its ED line continues to account for half of the health tech unicorn\u2019s revenue. In a statement, the company said that, alongside its acquisition and pharmacy growth, it launched Ro Mind for mental health and Ro Derm for skincare. In a statement in response to TechCrunch\u2019s 2021 investigation into Ro\u2019s culture and business, Reitano said that Derm is on pace to do over $20 million in revenue in 2021. He also said that non-Roman revenue is growing faster than Roman, reportedly 150% year over year. In a previous, separate email sent to employees, Ro leadership said that they will put \u201cmore energy and resources toward fewer initiatives for the remainder of Q2 and H2. \u201cNarrowing the focus does not mean we will launch any fewer products or services for patients. In fact, we believe it will have the opposite effect. We will increase the speed of innovation for patients,\u201d the memo continues, also noting that it will build \u201cnew products for existing patients.\u201d \u201cThe mantra for the remainder of the year (and potentially beyond) will be growth with discipline,\u201d the e-mail continued. Quite a different feel than just last year when the company raced to be the \u201cAmazon of healthcare.\u201d Current and former Ro employees can contact Natasha Mascarenhas by e-mail at natasha.m@techcrunch.com or on Signal, a secure encrypted messaging app, at 925 271 0912.

        "Extracted Article": "MasterClass, an education platform that sells subscriptions to celebrity-taught classes, has cut 20% of its team to \u201cadapt to the worsening macro environment and get to self-sustainability faster,\u201d CEO David Rogier tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. The layoff impacts roughly 120 people across all teams, but no C-suite executives were cut, a MasterClass spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. \u201cOur mission \u2014 to make it possible for anyone to learn from the best \u2014 hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t change,\u201d Rogier continued on Twitter. \u201cThis very tough step will strengthen our position both financially and strategically, allowing us to serve our members, employees and instructors for many years to come.\u201d Today is a sad day @masterclass. I made the really hard decision to reduce our team by 20% to adapt to the worsening macro environment and get to self sustainability faster. &mdash; David Rogier (@drogier) June 22, 2022 A MasterClass spokesperson said that the company will be offering 11 weeks of base pay to all employees as part of a severance package, with one additional week for every year spent at MasterClass. The company is also waiving the one-year investing cliff, and employees will have the chance to extend options. The startup has committed to covering employee healthcare through the end of the year. It is also providing mental health counseling until the end of the year and job counseling for the next three months. Laptops can be kept for personal use. There is no hiring freeze, the spokesperson confirmed. When asked for more specifics on what triggered the layoff, the spokesperson pointed to Rogiers Twitter and LinkedIn statements. MasterClass made a splash during the early innings of the pandemic by meeting a newfound consumer interest in remote education with aspirational content (aka, entertainment) from celebrities such as Serena Williams and Issa Rae. Offering paywalled, documentary-style content, MasterClass has raised more than $460 million in known venture capital from investors including IVP, NEA and Owl Ventures. Its model even inspired other companies: Outlier, founded by MasterClass\u2019 co-founder, closed a $30 million Series B, and former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparov launched a \u201cMasterClass for chess lovers\u201d platform. MasterClass charges a $180 annual subscription fee for users to access its library of content. The subscription model was responsible for 80% of the company\u2019s revenue in 2018, and, as of late, is responsible for 100% of its revenue. The company was last valued at $2.75 billion, sources told CNBC. While it is celebrated for leading the edutainment category, MasterClass has always had some clear hurdles to surpass, including getting users who gravitate to the platform for one class to stick around for other classes. The company has also spent heavily on marketing and on instruction. In 2017, the Hollywood Reporter said that most MasterClass instructors are paid at least $100,000 up front and receive a share of at least 30% of the revenue; it seems likely that those numbers have increased over the last five years. What the MasterClass effect means for edtech MasterClass isnt the only edtech scaling back after a period of spotlight. Eruditis, an edtech unicorn, laid off 40 people and had 40 people resign voluntarily, reports Inc42. The publication says that people on the talent acquisition, or hiring, team were impacted as Eruditis scales back its hiring plans, from bringing on 1,300 people over the past 12 months to only wanting 150 more people, at most, this year. Section4, an upskilling startup launched by prominent NYU professor Scott Galloway, also laid off a quarter of staff, largely impacting the product team. Then, of course, in April, per the Economic Times, richly valued Indian edtech Unacademy laid off 1,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting measure. The same outlet reports that Vedantu, another edtech unicorn, cut 200 employees. Public edtech companies Duolingo and Coursera have also seen stock values slashed. Layoffs hit crypto and real estate tech particularly hard this week"

        "Extracted Article": "Singapore-based crypto exchange Bybit has joined a long list of companies that have laid off some of their employees. As the cryptocurrency market is facing tremulous times, firms are finding new ways to cut costs and stay afloat. Crypto journalist James Wu first noted the news about Bybits layoffs yesterday. He said that the company is cutting a whopping 30% of its 2,000 people workforce. Bybit is highly dependent on professionalism and rapid execution capabilities. We are exploring a way to remove overlapping functions and build smaller but more agile teams to improve our efficiency. Starting from this week, some of the functions and roles will be reviewed to ensure we stay focused and agile, the company said in a statement. To support the smooth transition of the process, affected colleagues will be accorded a severance package and access to Bybit\u2019s employee career support in their job transition. Bybit said it has 6 million registered users with more than 190,000 users, who are trading futures or spots on the exchange daily. The firm had spent heavy money on marketing over the last year, including a sponsorship deal with F1 team Red Bull Racing, reportedly worth $150 million. Last week, Coinbase said that its cutting its workforce by 18% \u2014 almost 1,100 people. Crypto.com CEO Kris also said the company is laying off 5% (260 people) of its staff. Lending platform BlockFi was another firm that aims to save costs by giving a pink slip to 20% (850 people) of its employees. The Crypto market is currently facing a winter as prices of different tokens and coins have plummeted. Over the weekend, Bitcoin dipped below $19,000 and Ether dipped below $1,000, only to recover during the last few days. Several crypto financial service providers like Celcius and Babel Finance have frozen withdrawals as they are trying to battle the downturn in the market. In an interview with NPR over the weekend, crypto exchange FTXs founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said that increase in interest rates by Fed is driving this crypto bear market.

The Gurugaon-headquartered startup, which has raised over $110 million and counts General Catalyst, Norwest Venture Partners and Jungle Ventures among its backers, said it is cutting the jobs to bring about \u201cstructural changes across functions at CityMall.\u201d The layoff impacts at least 30% of the three-year-old startup\u2019s workforce, according to a LinkedIn analysis. CityMall works with over 30 000 micro-entrepreneurs to power its e-commerce engine in about 30 Indian cities. The startup said two months ago that it had over 500 employees. After exploring multiple options, weve realized that there [are] certain roles within the company which had to be dissolved to align to our evolving business model and the current business environment,\u201d the startup said in a LinkedIn post. The three-year-old startup said it will work with the affected employees to help them land jobs. \u201cEach and every employee affected by this layoff has contributed to building CityMall to what it is today, and this is one of the toughest decisions the company has ever had to make,\u201d the startup said. The Sunday announcement marks the latest in a growing series of layoffs among Indian startups. BlinkIt, formerly known as Grofers, a struggling online grocer, online learning platforms Unacademy, Eruditus and Vedantu, cars marketplace Cars24, fintech Rupeek, social commerce Meesho and online pharmacy PharmEasy are among startups that have let go employees in recent weeks. Jobs of over 9,500 employees in India have been eliminated this year due to the market correction (or so has been the single most popular excuse.) Investors in India, as is the case elsewhere, have significantly slowed down the pace of their investments as tech stocks globally fall to a level not seen in recent years."

        "Extracted Article": "On-demand food delivery company JOKR said it was shuttering its New York and Boston deliveries as of June 19 and leaving the U.S. market altogether, with co-founder and CEO Ralf Wenzel saying the startup is going to focus on Latin America. \u201cWe have decided to stop our business activities in the U.S. for now, which have lately only accounted for about 5% of our business and with a very differently structured opportunity,\u201d Wenzel said in a statement. \u201cGiven our unique position in Latin America, we decided to increase our investments in the region organically and by exploring complementary inorganic opportunities, expand our geographic footprint and expand on our service offering to become the leading and most customer serving online grocery business across Latin America, a 1.2tn retail market with less than 10% online penetration.\u201d T\u200bhe New York and Boston operations accounted for nine micro-fulfillment centers out of JOKR\u2019s network of approximately 200 worldwide, according to Bloomberg. The move will also cut about 50 workers from its 950-person office staff. In JOKR\u2019s one-year lifespan, it has taken in more than $430 million, including a $260 million Series B round last November. At that time, the company said its valuation was $1.2 billion and touted itself as \u201cone of the fastest companies to reach unicorn status in history.\u201d Perhaps it was a little too early for the company to toot its own \u201chorn.\u201d Even though JOKR hadn\u2019t been in New York for that long, the news isn\u2019t much of a surprise, actually, for a few reasons. First, I spoke to Wenzel in April, and asked him about an Information story from February that discussed JOKR possibly selling its New York operations. At the time, Wenzel called it a rumor, telling me, \u201cWe\u2019ve been operating in New York, and there\u2019s no strategic shifts.\u201d However, he also hinted that the company was looking at its footprint in New York, saying, \u201cIn terms of looking into the warehouse distribution, we opened new warehouses and we closed other warehouses as we looked into what was the right location, what was the right proximity to different customers.\u201d While the company was mum on where, Wenzel\u2019s comments implied that closings were likely ahead. Even though some food delivery companies, like Buyk, Fridge No More and Zero Grocery folded earlier this year, it didn\u2019t sound like things were that dire over at JOKR. Wenzel said JOKR had been focused on \u201creinventing retail,\u201d over the past 12 months, which entailed \u201chow to especially disrupt the supply chain and procurement side of things.\u201d When asked how that strategy was working out, Wenzel replied that things had been going so well that \u201cwe have now become fully gross profit positive on a group level for our local business across all of our countries after 12 months of operations.\u201d Second, as mentioned, food delivery companies are facing tough times as funding dried up and the rush to invest into this sector, partly as a result of the global pandemic, caused it to become quite inflated and due for a course-correct. This became evident when some of JOKR\u2019s competitors began announcing layoffs. For example, in May, Gopuff, Gorillas and Getir announced staff reductions. Zapp also had layoffs. TechCrunch took a deeper look at what was happening in the on-demand delivery space earlier this month and what it means for the industry going forward. Perhaps faster delivery times were a poor choice from a unit-economics perspective The delivery market is coming down from its pandemic highs"

        "Extracted Article": "Clearco, a Toronto-based fintech capital provider for online companies, is walking back the international expansion it once touted as the future of the company. One month after cutting 25% of its total staff, Clearco is conducting another round of layoffs as it retracts its international presence in the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Australia. CEO and co-founder Michele Romanow tells TechCrunch over e-mail that Clearco had to let go of approximately 60 more employees on the international teams. The latest workforce reduction is just one step Clearco has taken over the past few months, including prior rounds of layoffs, to refocus its business operations amid the changing e-commerce scene. Similar to other employees laid off by the company, those impacted will receive severance pay, a two-year window to exercise equity and job support. As Clearco\u2019s international workforce is cut, its global clients will now turn to Outfund, an e-commerce investor that operates in the U.K. and Australia. Clearco describes the \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d as one where its international clients \u2014 which span Australia, the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 will be able to now go to Outfund for support. Romanow said that customers will be transitioned to Outfund through a referral agreement, meaning that Clearco will make money off of the partnership. Outfund, claims Clearco, has committed to invest \u00a3500 million in small businesses in 2022. Clearco, meanwhile, will return to focus on its two biggest markets: the United States and Canada, which both account for 80% of its activity. To give you a sense of scale, Clearco invested over $3.2 billion in companies across the world, but only $429 million \u2014 or 13% \u2014 of that activity was in companies outside of those core two markets. The company partnered with FirePower last year to expand its check-writing ability to back the two markets. It\u2019s a move that isn\u2019t all too surprising for those who have been following the SoftBank-backed unicorn. When Clearco cut a quarter of staff in July, Romanow said at the time that it was considering strategic options for its international operations. Clearco expanded to Germany in June but simultaneously cut 10% of its staff in Ireland, just three months after breaking into the market and announcing plans to hire over 100 employees, reports Independent.ie. Clearco does have a host of international competition, including, but not limited to, Pipe, Divibank, Uncapped and Wayflyer. Despite the crowded space, Clearco attempted a global growth move fueled by fresh venture capital money. Romanow said \u201cthere was huge demand in line with the economic growth we were seeing during the pandemic with e-commerce businesses.\u201d \u201cWe were really excited and ambitious about our growth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just had no way to predict the current macroeconomic environment, which frankly looks worse in Europe than in the U.S. Compounded with a slowdown in e-commerce growth meant we suddenly faced significant headwinds internationally that simply didn\u2019t exist six months ago.\u201d Romanow isn\u2019t the first founder to conduct multiple rounds of layoffs in quick succession over the past few months. Robinhood, On Deck, Gemini and Hopin all make the same, troubling list. The entrepreneur, who co-founded the business with her former partner Andrew D\u2019Souza years ago, said that she would \u201cprobably pause more before making hiring decisions too quickly even if all of the signs in the market seem to be pointing that way.\u201d \u201cThe desire to build an amazing team to support rapid expansion as quickly as possible and the need to be prudent and think about sustainability and stability first and foremost is a very delicate balance,\u201d she added. \u201cI would encourage other founders to be as proactive as possible, especially with difficult decisions.\u201d As for the future of Clearco, it sounds like there\u2019s more focus and simplification to come. Romanow admits that the product hasn\u2019t always been \u201cthe most simple to understand\u201d and that there are changes coming to the revenue-based financing tools they provide. The company last raised venture capital money in July 2021, a $215 million round led by SoftBank Vision Fund II. That financing event closed just weeks after Clearco completed its most recent financing, a $100 million round that quintupled its valuation to $2 billion."

        "Extracted Article": "Policygenius, an insurtech that raised $125 million in a Series E round less than three months ago, has reportedly laid off about 25% of its staff. The number of employees affected is not confirmed but is believed to be around 170, according to multiple sources. One employee posted on LinkedIn today that he was among the 25% of staff that were let go. In a statement provided via email, Jennifer Fitzgerald, CEO and co-founder of Policygenius, did not confirm that number, saying: As with many companies, the sudden and dramatic shift in the economy has forced us to adapt our strategy. After careful consideration, we announced the difficult and necessary decision to reduce the size of our workforce. With these changes, we remain confident in the future of our company, our continued innovation, and the excellent service we continue to provide our customers every day. This is a difficult day for us at Policygenius, and especially for our employees who have been directly impacted. We\u2019re saying goodbye to friends and colleagues who have, through their hard work and dedication, helped build this company and deliver on our mission for our customers. We\u2019re grateful for their many contributions and wish them all the best. At the time of its Series E in March, Policygenius \u2014 whose software essentially allows consumers to find and buy different insurance products online \u2014 said that its home and auto insurance business had \u201cgrown significantly,\u201d with new written premiums having increased \u201cmore than 6x from 2019 to 2021.\u201d In a press release, the company said: \u201cPolicygenius continues to be the only tech-enabled brokerage and distribution platform to have successfully scaled and diversified across life and home and auto insurance. The company will use the new capital to continue to invest in the growth of its core businesses of life, disability, home, and auto insurance, as well as new no-exam life insurance offerings and Policygenius Pro.\u201d Since its 2014 inception, Policygenius has raised over $250 million from investors such as KKR, Norwest Venture Partners and Revolution Ventures as well as strategic backers such as Brighthouse Financial, Global Atlantic Financial Group, iA Financial Group, Lincoln Financial and Pacific Life. Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois de Lame, co-founders of Policygenius. Image Credits: Policygenius While we can\u2019t speak specifically to Policygenius, it\u2019s been widely reported how poorly insurtech companies have fared in the public markets over the past year with Lemonade, Root and Hippo all trading significantly lower than their opening prices. For example, as my colleague Alex Wilhelm wrote in January, Lemonade, which sells rental insurance, went public in early July 2020. Root, which focuses on auto insurance, went out in October of the same year. Metromile, also in auto insurance, went public via a SPAC in February 2021. And, finally, Hippo, focused on home coverage, went public via a blank check company in August of last year. It was quite the run of liquidity for companies that racked up impressive venture backing in their early days. Since then, Metromile announced that it would sell itself to Lemonade after losing nearly all of its value; today, Metromile is worth around $1.12 per share, down from a 52-week high of $12.74 per share. Its peers also struggled. Lemonade has seen its value erode from $115.85 per share to $21.72 as of the time of writing. Root is worth $1.48 per share, down from a 52-week high of $14.70. Hippo is down to $1.42 per share from its 52-week high of $10.82. Alex and team have covered the carnage over the last few quarters. In January, Root also conducted a layoff that affected 330 people, citing pandemic challenges. My weekly fintech newsletter, The Interchange, launched on May 1! Sign up here to get it in your inbox."

        "Extracted Article": "\u201cWe have all seen the state of the market,\u201d IRL CEO and co-founder Abraham Shafi wrote in a company-wide memo where the social app announced it would be dramatically cutting staff. Similar to dozens of startups over the past few weeks, IRL has just announced its laying off 25% of its team, or around 25 people, citing market dynamics. The cut comes around a year after the startup landed a $170 million SoftBank-led Series C and hit coveted unicorn status. What\u2019s different from recent layoffs, though, is the company\u2019s tone. \u201cCourage is a decision, and we will choose courage,\u201d Shafi wrote in the memo, obtained by TechCrunch. \u201cWhatever we are facing today can\u2019t be any worse than the uncertainty we met at the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic.\u201d Regardless of the state of the pandemic, though, layoffs force workers into an unexpected period of precariousness, augmented by the impending loss of health insurance. Regarding the decision to cut staff, Shafi wrote that IRL has \u201cmore than enough cash to last well into 2024.\u201d Over the last year, the startup increased its head count by 3.5 times, but Shafi noted that WhatsApp was able to grow to 450 million users with a team of 55. This suggests that the workforce reduction was less about trying to reduce runway and more about right-sizing the team after a period of overhiring. Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging, the CEO wrote. Like the Olympics, we know most people don\u2019t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you. Throughout the memo, Shafi emphasizes the employees necessity to adapt and be disciplined. I have been reflecting on Darwin\u2019s observation that the highest indicator of survival for any living organism is not brute force strength, but how quickly it can adapt to its changing environment, Shafi wrote. This company is a living organism, and our ability to adapt to our changing environment is of the utmost importance. Going forward, IRL is focused on being an engineering-led organization, suggesting that the layoffs impacted other teams. An employee at IRL, who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the layoffs and said that they \u201csupport the move and respect it.\u201d \u201cIt shows a SoftBank company is taking responsibility, usually SoftBank companies get criticized a lot,\u201d they said. \u201cFinancially, I know we\u2019re good because I heard we have around $100 million still in the bankyears and years of runway.\u201d The employee, who was not impacted by this layoff, said that the startup has a ton of new features, partnerships and prototypes in the works to create a more meaningful service in the future. IRL was founded in 2017 as a way to help users find real-world events, but when the pandemic hit, the platform pivoted to prioritize the discovery of online events. The company told TechCrunch at the time of its Series C that it had 20 million registered users, with 400% growth over a 15-month period. But some employees told The Information that they were skeptical of the accuracy of these numbers. Its unclear if IRLs user growth played a role in todays layoffs, but its more likely a combination of factors, including also the current economic downturn thats impacting the tech industry more broadly. Even as global lockdowns have eased, IRL remained dedicated to its new, digital-first strategy while also allocating money from its Series C to help bring back in-person events. At the same time, IRL also invested in its integration with TikTok and thought of itself as a potential \u201cWeChat of the West.\u201d It later acquired the digital nutrition startup AeBeZe Labs with an eye on making its service a healthier social app. While the co-founder cites macroeconomic environment as reasoning to adapt, he also talked about how both individual economic hardship and recent tragedies like mass shootings could increase the demand for \u201chumans\u2019 need to feel connection and intimacy,\u201d which is IRL\u2019s mission. \u201cNow, our mission is not for the faint of heart. There will be naysayers, critics, hackers, spammers and so on, he continued. \u201cWe will succeed as long as we focus on what we know and what we can control. Not just for us but our users worldwide.\u201d Shafi confirmed the layoffs, and provided the following statement to TechCrunch: \u201cAs we assess our path forward, we\u2019ve had to make the unfortunate decision to reduce our team. Were grateful for each of these individuals contributions in bringing IRL\u2019s mission to life as well as the impressive business acumen that they brought to the table everyday. We wish our former teammates the best on their journeys ahead; They are talented people, and we have no doubt they will thrive anywhere. As such, along with the offered severance, we\u2019ll provide any support where we can for those who may want it in their search for their next endeavor. As for what\u2019s next for IRL, we\u2019ll remain focused on building a product and community that creates more fulfilling human connections for the next generation.\u201d You can read the memo he sent to staff, per sources, in its entirety below: Dear IRL Team, Today was tough. We had to lay off many talented people, which is never easy. The journey ahead isn\u2019t easy either, but I am confident that it will be easier with all of you. We have all seen the state of the market. It is the worst since 2007-2008, but this is not a time to panic. Instead, this is a time to make the most of constraints. Courage is a decision, and we will choose courage. Whatever we are facing today can\u2019t be any worse than the uncertainty we met at the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic. Let\u2019s remember that great tech companies were forged during more challenging economic times. Many of the great products and services we all use today (Uber, AirBnB, etc\u2026) caught their stride during a downturn, and we will be no different. We can\u2019t control market dynamics, but we can control how we invest our time and resources in any market dynamic. To increase our success, we will continue to be more disciplined with our time and resources. We also needed to downsize our team to the fundamentals in service of our focus. Exercising discipline and adaptation to our current environment means moving from a 100-person team to a ~75-person team. With a focus on being an engineering led organization. To put it into perspective, this is still a 3.5x increase in headcount from a year ago. Gratefully we have more than enough cash to last well in 2024 and now is the time to be offensive, diligent, and proactive. Whatsapp was able to grow to 450M users with a team of 55. I am inspired by that and I believe we will forge our own amazing story with a small but incredibly amazing team. I have been reflecting on Darwin\u2019s observation that the highest indicator of survival for any living organism is not brute force strength, but how quickly it can adapt to its changing environment. This company is a living organism, and our ability to adapt to our changing environment is of the utmost importance. Our goal remains the same, to provide a product and a set of tools that helps to truly bring the entire world closer together through shared interests, communities, and more intimate and meaningful conversations. The world is going through a collective struggle of inflation, higher cost of goods, layoffs, school shootings, and many experiencing loneliness and depression. During these kinds of shifts, humans\u2019 need to feel connection and intimacy through tough times increases massively. Our mission has never been more critical than it is now. I am not saying we can solve all human suffering or loneliness entirely, but if we can even play our role enabling any meaningful impact, it\u2019s worth it . The way things get better is by everyone doing their best to help make the world a little nicer, a little softer, and a little more friendly. All of that compounds into real impact. One of the intentional decisions I made in building our product is to focus on making the business success symbiotic with consumer success. It is a virtuous loop. As long as we focus everything we have on being of service and to people, connecting and feeling less alone in this world, we will be building a deeply meaningful business. We have already seen the people who are adopting IRL are doing so because they don\u2019t want to use Facebook and no other product fits their core needs around groups, events, and communities. I have always believed that every excellent consumer company reflects and amplifies a part of humanity. And each product satisfies a specific and unique human need, impulse, or compulsion. Tiktok is for entertainment. Twitter caters to venting. Instagram is for showing off your lifestyle. Snapchat is for sharing moments. IRL is for your communities. The original, fundamental thing that makes us human is to be in community. Given this truth, it is incredible no single company is winning across the globe. This is our opportunity. To become the place for humans to organize and find their community. Big or small. Public or private. We see the impact we are making on our users and the thriving communities and conversations people have found in our product to date, and we are just getting started. A small handful of companies in the social space have made such an impact on people that they can consider themselves iconic and meaningful for decades to come. I fundamentally believe that if we are successful in our mission, we will cement ourselves as one of them as well. For us at IRL, it\u2019s critical to deliver a measurable sense of progress in digital interactions and relationships so they don\u2019t feel swift and superficial; or utterly repetitive and removed from real life. We can (and must) develop prompts, nudges, design in delight that makes people smile, and create an incredible product to improve the human experience online. Now, our mission is not for the faint of heart. There will be naysayers, critics, hackers, spammers, and so on. We will succeed as long as we focus on what we know and what we can control. Not just for us but our users worldwide. Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging. Like the Olympics, we know most people don\u2019t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you. I have worked my entire life for a moment like this, and I am dedicated to putting every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears into making this a reality. Life is short, and I want to make the most of every moment. I am grateful that every day I get to wake up and obsess over helping others connect through community. I believe all of you feel this way, and I am so deeply honored to work alongside you all. I wish our former teammates the best on their journeys ahead. They are talented people, and I have no doubt they will thrive elsewhere. For those of us who remain at IRL, this is a new chapter for all of us to see what we are capable of. Here in service to you, Abraham Shafi Sarah Perez contributed reporting to this piece.

        "Extracted Article": "Loom, an enterprise collaboration video messaging service, has laid off 34 employees, or 14% of its total staff, sources say. Employees across product and people operations were impacted. The venture-backed company confirmed the layoff and number of people impacted, and provided the following statement from founder and CEO Joe Thomas: We\u2019ve had to make the extremely difficult decision to move forward with a reduction in force across our team. Each person impacted was not only a talented employee, but also a valued individual and teammate. We\u2019re committed to supporting these employees through this transition both in their offered severance as well as career support. We\u2019re confident in the path ahead for Loom. This decision was ultimately made to ensure we\u2019re able to move forward sustainably, especially in light of increased economic uncertainty, and continue to deliver on our vision for years to come. The company was founded by Thomas and Vinay Hiremath in 2015, hitting 1.8 million users across 50,000 businesses just three years later. Per its website, Loom currently boasts 14 million users across 200,000 companies including Netflix, Atlassian, HubSpot and Juniper Networks. https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people/ Similar to Hopin, Loom benefited from a surge of people working from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the product was positioned to help remote workers find better ways to connect with colleagues in a virtual-first world, and help hybrid workforces find a lightweight way to skip some meetings. Then, again similar to Hopin, the startup conducted layoffs to help it build in what it describes as a more sustainable way moving forward. That growth has attracted $203 million in known venture capital funding, with the company most recently announcing a Series C led by Andreessen Horowitz. The same round valued the company at $1.53 billion, making it hit unicorn status for the first time. Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Coatue and General Catalyst are also investors in the company. Over a year has gone by since the startup landed the new financing and valuation, and per today\u2019s news, Loom joins the club of unicorns that have had to scale back workforces after landing the coveted milestone. Less than a year ago, visual creator tools startup Picsart raised $130 million from SoftBank, landing a valuation of over $1 billion. The company laid off 8% of its staff last month, affecting 90 people. Cameo, which also became a unicorn last year, also recently conducted layoffs that impacted 87 people.

        "Extracted Article": "Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup SWVL is planning to lay off 32% of its workforce it said in a statement today. The companys LinkedIn profile shows it has over 1,330 employees. Letting go of over 30% of its workforce means that around 400 people will lose their jobs at the mobility company. Tech companies, private and public, have faced a reckoning in the past few months with their valuations taking a beating. The effect of an economic downturn has also affected their finances leading them to cut costs; the top of the list is letting go of employees. This downsizing from the Dubai-based startup adds to the long list of global cross-stage layoffs in what has been a rough month for tech employees. Over 15,000 tech workers have lost their jobs in the U.S. alone according to reports. Companies such as Klarna, Getir, Gorillas and Bolt (the payments company) have dismissed portions of their workforce while the likes of Snap, Twitter and Instacart have slowed down hiring entirely. Its been a very busy 18 months for SWVL leading up to this news. This March, the company went public via a SPAC merger with U.S. women-led blank check company Queen\u2019s Gambit Growth Capital. It listed at $10 per share and targeted a $1.5 billion valuation but has traded between $4 and $8 for the most part. Its current valuation hovers around $500-$600 million. All eyes are on Swvl as it starts trading on a SPAC combination The layoffs are coming just a month after SWVL acquired U.K.-based mass transit group Zeelo for $100 million according to sources. Its one of five acquisitions SWVL has made within the past year; others include Germany\u2019s door2door, Turkey\u2019s Voltlines (for ~$40 million), Spain\u2019s Shotl and Argentina\u2019s Viapool. SWVL said that though these acquisitions have contributed to its overall growth, it will need to make reductions on roles automated by investments in its engineering and product and support functions teams. The planned layoffs will impact teams responsible for functions that have been automated following investment in engineering, product and support functions, SWVL said in a statement. SWVL said it plans to attain profitability next year. Dismissing hundreds of employees is one way to get there. Others include developing its proprietary technology stack and growing its three models \u2014 where it makes $5 million in MRR \u2014 across existing and new markets, it said in a statement. SWVL is present in 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. According to a source, the majority of the layoffs will come from the company\u2019s Dubai and Pakistan offices. Whether SWVL will continue its expansion into new markets such as Colombia, Mexico and South Africa, and the U.S. announced during its SPAC merger is uncertain. Swvl plans to provide monetary, non-monetary and job placement support to help transition certain of its employees to new roles, the company said in a statement on how it plans to support affected employees. As a result of the portfolio optimization program, Swvl\u2019s management currently expects that the company will be cash-flow positive in 2023. CEO Mostafa Kandil sent out a letter to his employees addressing the layoffs. Heres a part of it: Become Free Cash Flow Profitable in 2023 Swvl is implementing a portfolio optimization program to focus on its highest profitability operations, enhance efficiency and reduce central costs Capitalizes on the highest profitability operations TaaS and SaaS which currently have &gt; 500 contracts in &gt; 10 countries generating &gt; $5m revenue per month B2C business is also expected to be contribution margin positive before the end of 2022 Builds on recent acquisitions of TaaS and SaaS businesses Viapool, Volt Lines, Shotl and pending acquisition of door2door which improve profitability margins Benefits from a world class engineering and product team and technology stack which allows for scalability and sustainable growth Resources No matter how big, resources are not infinite; cash is meant to be responsibly utilized. We need to be as disciplined as ever, which is why today, May 30, 2022, we announced that our portfolio optimization program to turn cash flow positive in 2023. As part of that program, we have considered various scenarios that will allow us to demonstrate how much we value our workforce. We believe that Swvl has reached such a level of success only because of the team, and we are also sure that Swvl will continue to get stronger. What we did: Voluntary salary deductions from the top management team Reduction of current office spaces Freezing our current hiring program Freezing travel and accommodation expenses Tying expenditures to essential business requirements People Effective today, May 30, 2022, we are optimizing our operations in some of our markets while reducing our workforce. The reduction follows an extensive evaluation of team redundancy and how this complements our strategy. We have arranged for one-to-one communications with all of the impacted teammates. Each member of the reduced workforce will receive an invitation to have a conversation with a relevant senior leader to receive clarity on the next steps based on each markets local laws, severance rules, and best practices. To those who will leave, I would like to say I am sorry. And more importantly, this is not your fault. You will forever be part of Swvl, and our door will always be open to you in the future. We are incredibly lucky and grateful to have worked with such remarkable talent that many companies would be fortunate to have. Besides your work, what will stay with us is knowing that we genuinely did hire people better than us. I am sure you will continue to have a significant impact wherever you go, as you have done day in and day out at Swvl. Easing the transition for impacted employees: Severance: All impacted employees to receive severance based on gross salary and complete cash payout Provident Fund, Gratuity &amp; Leave encashment other legal payments All RSU to be considered vested Expense claims/OPD claims to be cleared All Final Settlements to be taxed as per local requirement Payout Transfer to be complete in the next 21 days Medical Insurance: to be extended for all entitled employees Stock Options: all unvested stocks for impacted employees to continue to vest as per schedule Alumni Directory: an alumni network directory to support our impacted workforce No interview policy for Rejoiners Laptops to be retained by employees subject to data security requirements Update: In an email to TechCrunch, CFO Youssef Salem said Swvl is not shutting down operations in any country whether from its existing footprint or planned expansions but rather optimizing its network and headcount in each country. https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/heres-how-to-protect-your-equity-if-you-get-laid-off/ 10 steps for managing layoffs respectfully"

        "Extracted Article": "It continues to be a very rough week for e-commerce companies in Europe. In the latest development, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Getir the $12 billion quick commerce upstart that provides grocery essentials and sundries and promises delivery of them in minutes is cutting 14% of its staff globally. Its been estimated that the Turkish company employs some 32,000 people in the nine markets where it operates, which would work out to 4,480 people impacted by the downsizing. In addition to the headcount, the company plans to curtail a lot of its capital-intensive expansion which will include hiring, marketing investments and promotions. (Promotions in this context are not HR promotions, but the many discounts and free vouchers that quick commerce startups have been using to lure users to their platforms, at huge cost to the startups themselves.) According to a memo that we have seen which we are publishing below the cuts will vary by country. (One source in Berlin estimated that the cuts in that city alone will be around 400, although this is not a number Getir would confirm.) The company has confirmed that it will not be pulling out of any specific country as part of this. Getir currently operates in its home market of Turkey, as well as the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Portugal and the U.S. This is a stark swing of the pendulum for a company that raised $768 million at an $11.8 billion valuation just two months ago. But its not a surprise in the wider market context we are in at the moment, with tech companies big and small all seeing a downturn in their finances and valuations in the face of a wider cooling of the market. Just yesterday, one of Getirs big rivals in Europe, Gorillas, announced layoffs of 300 people and plans to explore strategic options, including sales or exits, in several European markets. Earlier in the week, Klarna the Swedish buy now, pay later company confirmed it would cut 10% of its workforce amid reports that it was seeking to raise money at a reduced valuation. The world of instant grocery delivery specifically has been one that many would argue was ripe for right-sizing for a while now. Founded seven years ago, Getir was an early mover in the instant grocery market, but the last couple of years has seen an explosion of the category. COVID-19 led to a change in consumer habits: In many cases stores were outright closed for periods of time, and people were less inclined to shop in person when they were open, and that led to a surge of people willing to try out shopping for groceries online for the first time. Many companies popped up, propped up by huge amounts of VC investment, to serve those consumers, and a sizable proportion of these startups were based on the premise of instant delivery, with items coming to your door within minutes of ordering, mimicking (or even reducing) the time it would take to quickly run to a physical store. Even before the capital markets collapsed earlier this year, several smaller startups either shut down or got acquired Getir being one of the consolidators, alongside other big players like Gopuff, Flink and Gorillas. Thats a trend that has continued into 2022, and there will likely be even more to come. Companies like Klarna and Getir may be coming from different corners of the world of commerce, but they share something in common: both are backed by Sequoia. The storied VC (which led Getirs Series C in 2021) just this week put together an alarm-bell presentation for portfolio companies, running through the state of the market today and some guidance on how to help weather the storm. The 50-slide presentation which a source shared with us covered topics like runway extension, fundraising in difficult markets, leadership in uncertain times and forecasting. Pointedly for a company like Getir which, similar to its rivals, has been raising hundreds of millions of dollars to pump into aggressive expansion strategies involving splashy ad campaigns, extensive operations infrastructure in urban areas and lots of promotions to bring on more consumers one slide was titled Growth at all costs is no longer being rewarded. The presentations message appears to have definitely hit home for Getir. The memo follows below. Well update this post as we learn more, and were sending our best wishes to those impacted by this news. Today is one of the most difficult days since we founded Getir, because we have to make tough decisions about our people organization that will adversely affect some of our team members. Rising inflation and the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook around the world pushes all companies, especially in the tech industry and including Getir, to adjust to the new climate. With a heavy heart, we today shared with our team the saddening and difficult decision to reduce the size of our global organization. At a global headquarter base, our reduction will be about 14%. Numbers will vary by country. We do not take these decisions lightly. We will do right by every person throughout this process in line with Getir\u2019s values of being a good and fair company. We will also decrease spending on marketing investments, promotions, and expansion. There is no change in Getir\u2019s plans to serve in the nine countries it operates. In these tough times, we are committed to leading the ultra-fast grocery delivery industry that we pioneered seven years ago."

        "Extracted Article": "You thought the market was bad for venture capitalists, but what about the actual workers behind the tech companies they\u2019ve backed? Reluctantly, we\u2019re writing a tech layoffs roundup for the third week in a row, because once again, there have been reductions across stages and sectors. Over the past month, public and private tech companies have been announcing mass layoffs across sectors. Employees from Section4, Carvana, DataRobot, Mural, Robinhood, On Deck, Thrasio, MainStreet and Netflix have been impacted by the workforce reductions. Some bigger companies are instituting hiring freezes, such as Twitter and Meta, or announcing a shift in strategy, such as Uber. As has been our mantra while reporting on the layoffs sweeping the tech industry: layoffs don\u2019t happen to companies, they happen to people. Especially for the U.S.-based tech employees, layoffs don\u2019t just mean a loss of income they mean a medically dangerous loss of healthcare. Let\u2019s take a look at which companies announced reductions this week. Netflix layoffs continue&nbsp; After layoffs hit Netflix\u2019s content arm Tudum a few weeks ago, 150 more primarily U.S.-based employees were let go, plus 70 other employees in the animation division. A Netflix representative wrote in an emailed statement, \u201cAs we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company.\u201d Netflix reported revenue of $7.87 billion for the first quarter of 2022 and a significant loss of 200,000 subscribers. Contractors were also impacted by these layoffs, but the number of affected workers in that designation is unclear. TechCrunch asked Netflix about reports that staff running diverse social channels like Strong Black Lead, Golden, Most and Con Todo were laid off, but Netflix said that the company decided not to renew contracts with certain agencies it used to recruit contractors. Still, it doesn\u2019t feel great to see queer people and people of color losing their jobs, which helped Netflix cater to these audiences. Picsarts unicorn status didnt save it&nbsp; Less than a year ago, Picsart raised $130 million from SoftBank, putting the visual creator tools startup into unicorn territory with a valuation exceeding $1 billion. A leaner, hipper version of Adobe, things seem to have taken a downturn for Picsart, which laid off 8% of its staff this week, affecting 90 people. Other SoftBank-backed companies like Cameo, which also became a unicorn last year, just conducted layoffs. When Alex Wilhelm last covered Picsart, he noted that the company was expected to go public that still hasn\u2019t happened, which may be a clue into what\u2019s going on at the company to precipitate such cuts. India\u2019s Cars24 cuts 600 jobs Cars24, a marketplace for used cars last valued at $3.3 billion by its venture capital investors, cut 600 jobs or 6% of its entire workforce this week. The Series G startup had just raised a $400 million round, making the reduction more about runway extension than lack of ability to pay the bills. As our own Manish Singh reports, Cars24 is one of many Indian startups that fired people in the last few weeks. Employees from Vedantu, Unacademy, Meesho, OkCredit, Trell, Furlenco and Lido have also cut several roles, he says. Marketplace startups, such as Cars24, feel especially vulnerable during a downturn. Consumer spending habits can get extremely fickle, which means that demand may decline while supply stays consistent or even grows. Balancing the two sides is the biggest art for any marketplace startup, but it becomes especially difficult to predict stability in revenue when everyone else has hit pause. Skillz scales back esports biz team&nbsp; Esports company Skillz laid off 70 employees, around 10% of the team, earlier this week, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. No executives were impacted by the cuts. \u201cWe decided to reorganize our resources and investments to increase our profitable growth and further deliver against our vision of building the competition layer of the internet,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis realignment resulted in changing some of our programs and consequently people on our team as we prioritize our resourcing levels to continue to offer a great player experience and enable more game developers to bring their creations to life.\u201d The company\u2019s statement is ironic; to better support its external community, it is cutting its internal community. The company says it plans to continue hiring in some areas of the business but did not mention which ones."

        "Extracted Article": "Section4, an upskilling startup launched by prominent NYU professor Scott Galloway, has laid off a quarter of staff sources say. The layoffs, which occurred last week, affected employees across all levels of seniority and teams, but specifically targeted a majority of the product team. The startup first splashed onto the scene in 2019 with a goal to scale business school-quality courses in a more affordable, and entirely virtual, way. CEO Greg Shove confirmed layoff details to TechCrunch over email and said that 32 people were impacted. The executive declined to disclose specifics on what impacted employees were offered but said that the severance package was at market or better. Shove added that there is no hiring freeze and that the company will continue to employ folks in engineering and enterprise. Part of that hiring focus, he adds, is that the startup is moving faster in serving the enterprise than individual consumers, so hiring will reflect that. Sources back it up. They say that Section4 is having a full reorganization as a company because it is not hitting consumer growth numbers. In March 2022, Section4 hinted at potential underlying tensions with monetization: The company started offering unlimited courses for a single membership price rather than selling each course for $995. The startup last raised a $30 million Series A in March 2021. Per Shove, Section4 is aiming to serve 15,000 students and 200 enterprise customers by the end of the year. The company\u2019s reasoning for the layoffs, per sources, largely came from financial mismanagement, not yet having product market fit and hiring too much. Per LinkedIn, Section4 has 142 employees that work there. Sources say that leadership also pointed out that its main product \u2014 two- to three-long week courses taught by prominent professors from top schools \u2014 was too costly to produce. Post-pandemic reset leads to wave of layoffs in tech Put differently, the startup\u2019s initial goal was to create a more affordable way (think $700 per course versus $7,000) for managers to upskill themselves \u2014 and that is not working as planned. As of March 2021, the startup was hitting 70% completion rates and had taught 10,000 students. \u201cGraduate education was transformative in my life, and I enjoy teaching, and we thought there was an opportunity \u2014 because of the pandemic and changing behaviors \u2014 to start an online ed concept that tried to deliver 50% to 70% of the value of an elite MBA elective at 10% of the cost and 1% of the friction,\u201d Galloway previously told TechCrunch. Market shifts have rippled across tech in the past few weeks, as layoffs rocked unicorns and early-stage startups alike. Edtech, more specifically, enjoyed a capital injection during the early innings of the pandemic \u2014 and now, as consumer habits change, there\u2019s a correction starting to play out. Last month, per the Economic Times, richly valued Indian edtech Unacademy laid off 1,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting measure. The same outlet reports that Vedantu, another edtech unicorn, cut 200 employees. Public edtech companies have also seen stock values slashed: Duolingo is currently trading at $65.58, down sharply from a 52-week high of $205; Coursera is trading at $13.89, also remarkably down from a high of $46.99. These cuts, along with Section4s layoffs, all signal that edtech isnt an exception when it comes to the Great Reset in tech. The Great Resignation, meet the Great Reset"

        "Extracted Article": "Carvana, a used-car retailer in the United States that raised at least nine figures worth of venture capital while private before going public, announced 2,500 layoffs today. The staffing cuts, detailed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are part of the companys previously announced plans to better align staffing and expense levels with sales volumes, Carvana wrote. Per the same filing, the company will offer impacted team members the opportunity to receive four weeks of pay plus an additional week for every year they have been with Carvana, along with the opportunity to receive extended healthcare, among other things. Carvana also said that its executive team is forgoing their salaries for the remainder of the year to help contribute to the severance pay for departing team members. That the company is cutting staff is not a surprise given its recent financial performance; the scale of the layoffs, however, is eye-catching. Lets talk about how Carvana got to this point. So much for the afterglow Carvana is a deeply unprofitable company, losing money in the first quarter even on an EBITDA basis, a heavily-adjusted profit metric. In numerical terms, Carvana had Q1 revenues of $3.497 billion, up 56% compared to its year-ago result. Despite its top-line gains, Carvanas gross profit fell to $298 million in the three-month period, leading to a net loss of $506 million, far worse than its $82 million net deficit in Q1 2021. The companys EBITDA margin also declined from -1.3% in the first quarter of 2021 to -11.6% in the first three months of 2022. How did Carvana wind up growing its revenues while shrinking its gross profit at the same time, thus boosting its losses? Heres how the company explained the matter in its earnings report: We generally prepare for sales volume 6-12 months in advance, meaning we built capacity in most of our business functions for significantly more volume than we fulfilled in Q1. With our costs relatively fixed in the short-term, the lower retail unit volume led to higher cost of goods sold per unit (e.g., reconditioning and inbound transport costs), leading to lower GPU, and higher SG&amp;A per unit. These effects combined with rapidly rising interest rates and widening credit spreads led to lower EBITDA margin. Carvana overbuilt for volume it didnt reach, leading to higher fixed costs and worse profitability. The issue led to the company writing in its Q1 2022 report that it intends to better align sales with expense levels through a combination of higher sales and expense efficiencies in the next several quarters. Given that timeline, more staffing cuts could be on deck. Its worth mentioning that the company had an entire section in its Q1 report detailing its expansion plans, noting that it had opened one new inspection and reconditioning center, or IRC, in Q4 2021 and three in Q1 2022, adding that it expected open three more this year. (That Carvana is buying another company using external debt is another matter.) In its SEC filing, Carvana said that [i]n connection with these right-sizing initiatives, over the next several weeks Carvana will be transitioning operations away from its Euclid, OH IRC and a few logistics hubs, making its April comments feel odd in retrospect. Still, the company has to make changes. It missed every single one of its long-term financial goals in Q1 2022: Image Credits: Carvana shareholder letter Even more, Carvanas operations consumed $593 million in cash during the first quarter, a huge sum for a company that reported cash and equivalents of $247 million at the end of Q1 2022. Carvanas cuts come as a number of startups also cut staff; companies of all shapes and sizes are reducing staff where they perhaps overhired or expected more demand than materialized. Its a tough time for business, in a sense, with a yet-tight labor market coupled with above-average inflation and uneven market performance. This wont be the last set of layoffs that we report on in the second quarter."

        "Extracted Article": "Unfortunately, theres more where last week came from. Following last weeks slew of layoffs in tech, this week had another dose of staff cuts across tech companies. Impact was felt across industries ranging from education to security, as well as stages from a post-Series A startup to a recently-SPACd business. Below, weve listed the latest companies that have laid off talent in response to the reset happening across startup land. Big shout out to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker that aggregates tips, spreadsheets of impacted employees and other layoff details in one spot.

The company claims that the executive team is forgoing their salaries for the remainder of the year to contribute to severance pay. The mobility meets e-commerce startup surged on Thursday, after earlier hitting a two-year low. I guess thats how the market responds to people losing jobs? A Short squeeze? Latch Latch, an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems, has been struggling for the past few months from experiencing a difficult SPAC debut to parting ways with its CFO, Garth Mitchell. Well, it looks like the business volatility has now trickled down to employees with the public company reportedly cutting 30 people, or 6% of its total staff, per an e-mail obtained by TechCrunch. DataRobot In 2019, DataRobot had just raised a $206 million Series E round from Sapphire Ventures, Tiger Global Management and a number of other firms. Then, just weeks after COVID-19 arrived in the U.S., the Boston-based machine learning company conducted layoffs due to uncertainty. Fast-forward to the present, DataRobot laid off another 7% of its workforce this week. With about 1,000 employees, these layoffs are estimated to affect around 70 people. In an email to staff obtained by The Information, CEO Dan Wright said that the layoffs were a response to changing market conditions after aggressive hiring last year (a trend we saw across layoffs last week). \u201cThat level of investment is no longer sustainable for our business, particularly in the context of broader changes in the market, with investors now taking a harder look at efficiency and spending,\u201d he said in the email. Meta and Twitter freeze while Uber rethinks But wait, theres more On the heels of iffy Q1 earnings reports, some big tech companies are in trouble. Lets start with Meta n\u00e9e Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is all-in on building the metaverse, having just opened its first brick-and-mortar store. He also just demoed whats to come on the companys next headset, dubbed Project Cambria, which will incorporate mixed reality into the headset. But in Q1 alone, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs its VR and AR team operated at a loss of $2.96 billion, and last year, Reality Labs lost over $10 billion. Meanwhile, Facebooks user growth has become relatively stagnant. Last week, Insider reported that Facebook CFO David Wehner wrote in an internal memo that hiring will be paused across most engineering teams for the rest of the year, citing an industry-wide downturn. Then, this week, Reuters reported that Meta is preparing cutbacks in Reality Labs, a bad omen for its burgeoning metaverse business. Some candidates for jobs at Meta have had their offers rescinded, per a viral LinkedIn post. Twitter employees are also facing a moment of uncertainty as they await Elon Musks impending takeover. Yesterday, CEO Parag Agrawal who is expected to be replaced after Musks acquisition clears asked two key executives to leave. The company is also undergoing a hiring freeze, which isnt uncommon following M&amp;A deals. \u201cEffective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business-critical roles. We are also pulling back on non-labor costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. And then that brings us to Uber, which is valued lower now than it was in mid-2019. It\u2019s clear that the market is experiencing a seismic shift and we need to react accordingly, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote. He added, We will treat hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount. We will be even more hardcore about costs across the board. Its not easy to navigate the pandemic as a company that requires drivers and passengers to sit together in a car. But, Khosrowshahis note highlighted investors interest in products like Uber Eats, which set their service apart from competitors like Lyft. Still, food delivery isnt the most profitable business either. Unfortunately, its usually the workers who get the short end of the stick in these situations, whether theyre tech staff or contracted gig workers. Khosrowshahi ended his note with an attempt at optimism (?) in a turbulent time. GO GET IT! he said. https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/tech-layoffs-dont-happen-to-companies-they-happen-to-people/ Top Twitter execs, including heads of revenue and consumer products, are out following Musk deal"

        "Extracted Article": "On Deck, a tech company that connects founders to each other, capital and advice, has laid off 25% off its staff, per sources familiar with the company. The layoffs were announced today during an internal all hands meeting, and impacts about 72 people. Sources say that mostly operations and investing roles were impacted by layoffs. Severance packages were offered and include eight weeks of paid base salary, as well as 12 weeks of healthcare. It\u2019s unclear if any executives were cut, but TechCrunch has reached out to On Deck for further comment and has not yet heard back. Co-founders Erik Torenberg and David Booth did however confirm the layoffs in a blog post published after this story went live. As a community-centered company, our people have always been our highest priority. Our focus in the coming days will be on fully supporting our team \u2013 both those departing On Deck and those who will help us build the future, the post reads. On Deck, not to be confused with small business lender OnDeck, is a company that provides capital and network support for emerging fund managers and founders. Launched in June 2019, the company first announced a Founders Fellowship and has recently grown to offer more niche programs on specific verticals. In two years since launch, the company claims it has helped founders start over 1,000 companies and fill keep hiring roles. One of the startup\u2019s newer programs is ODX, an accelerator program that offers a $125,000 check, program and network support, in exchange for 7% of a company. The program has backed 150 companies to date. Despite this alleged growth, sources close to the company say that ODX is likely going to be scaled back and potentially even shut down. On Deck was originally raising a fund between $100 million and $150 million from Tiger Global, a hedge fund that is breaking into the early-stage market. It appears that On Deck never closed that large of a fund and landed closer to $40 million. \u201cAdd into that missed sales targets on the revenue side of the biz and a ridiculous hiring sprint, they now have [nine] months of runway pre-cuts,\u201d one of the sources said. The startup last raised known venture capital funding in March 2021, a $20 million Series A round led by Founders Fund. In an email obtained by TechCrunch, co-founders Erik Torenberg and David Booth addressed staff about the layoffs and the accelerator. In 2021, we launched ODX, our accelerator. We saw an opportunity to stand up and try our hand at innovating a stagnant accelerator market. By many accounts, we succeeded in this goal, the email reads. Unfortunately, over the same time period, the market began shifting dramatically. A few months in, the capital and accelerator markets were materially different from where they had been when we started. These factors forced us to reflect and consider how On Deck would continue for the future, support our communities and ensure long-term sustainability. The co-founders went on to say that they take full responsibility. not just for what brought us to this point, but also for making sure we do right by team members.

If the earliest investors keep going earlier, what will happen?"

        "Extracted Article": "A day of reckoning has come for Thrasio, one of the bigger startups buying up and consolidating third-party Amazon sellers. TechCrunch has learned from sources that the company, valued last year at between $5 billion and $10 billion, is going to be laying off a portion of its employees this week. That news is coming at the same time that Thrasio is changing its leadership: today it announced that Greg Greeley, a former president of Airbnb and a longtime Amazon executive, is joining its board and taking on the role of CEO this August. He will be succeeding Carlos Cashman, one of the co-founders of the company, who will remain on Thrasio\u2019s board as a director. The layoffs and new CEO appointment are the latest developments in a series of ups and downs for Thrasio in the last six months that underscore some of the challenges in the aggregator business model: \u2013 In April 2021, when Thrasio was announcing a $100 million raise, co-founder Josh Silberstein who at the time was co-CEO at the company with Cashman told TechCrunch that Thrasio was eyeing up a public listing to raise more money for expansion, either through a traditional IPO or via a SPAC; it was also appointing a new CFO to oversee the process. \u2013 The SPAC idea started to take shape over the summer, potentially valuing Thrasio as high as $10 billion. But then the new CFO left in July, just three months after joining; Silberstein subsequently left the company in September; and by the beginning of October, the SPAC option was delayed, reportedly due to problems that arose during a financial audit. \u2013 Yet by the end of that month, Thrasio announced another private fundraising, a whopping $1 billion deal led by Silver Lake, which was when it hit its $5-10 billion valuation. \u2013 Last week, people were sharing an email allegedly looking for investors in the company via a special purpose vehicle at a $2.7 billion valuation. Tellingly, the sender has gone silent (meaning: it may well be a hoax). The company declined to comment. Thrasio, the Amazon aggregator, raises $1B in fresh funding at a valuation of up to $10 billion Unfortunately, the layoffs are not a hoax. TechCrunch confirmed the rumors with the company, and we have also been shown an internal memo that explains how they will be carried out: people will be getting informed by their managers over the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). The company said in the memo that it \u201cmade the decision to reduce the size of the Thrasio team,\u201d but it has not confirmed how many employees will be impacted. We understand that the layoffs will be part of a bigger reorganization. In that memo to employees, Cashman and Thrasio president Danny Boockvar write that in order to keep Thrasio on its trajectory, the company would need to make certain \u201cstrategic and operational changes.\u201d \u201cThis is not an easy decision \u2013 especially within a culture like ours that is shaped around community and sharing,\u201d they added. Employees being let go will receive \u201cseverance, healthcare, job support, and accelerated vesting of some of your options,\u201d as well as career transition support and an alumni network for continued support, the memo mentioned. Their final working day will be May 13. Thrasio\u2019s growth Thrasio was founded in 2018 by Cashman and Silberstein to capitalize on a very Amazon-like economy of scale: the Amazon Marketplace has millions of businesses and brands selling on it (nearly 2 million active sellers by one estimate) and there is a business to be built in bringing some of them together to run more efficient production, marketing and analytics, and fulfillment across them. The businesses would be picked up by Thrasio, which would invest in tech to run them better and more profitably as e-commerce operations, both on Amazon and potentially outside of it as well a new kind of Procter &amp; Gamble for the twenty-first century. It raised nearly $3.4 billion in funding to build out its business, acquiring hundreds of brands, with investors including the likes of Silver Lake, Advent International, Oaktree, Upper90, Harlan and more. When it raised its $1 billion round last October, it was buying businesses at a rate of 1.5 per week and had several hundred brands in its portfolio. Dozens of other aggregators followed in Thrasio\u2019s wake some 150 according to Thrasio\u2019s estimates, collectively raising some $15 billion in capital to fuel those ambitions eyeing up the same opportunity as Thrasio was chasing. Thrasio itself became a top-five seller on Amazon. Thrasio raises $100M for its Amazon roll-up play, appoints retail CFO for its next steps Where Thrasio is headed It\u2019s not clear why a financial audit would have stalled Thrasio\u2019s SPAC last year, but it speaks to some of the challenges of running a business and accounting for it when it\u2019s evolving at a fast pace, and at its heart is about bringing multiple other businesses together. The concept of consolidating repetitive processes across multiple retailers sounds like a great idea in theory. \u201cWhat happens when you get into that price range is that it gets hard to grow your business and manage it,\u201d Silberstein told me last year, citing SEO, marketing and supply chain management as some of the challenges. \u201cThat means as you grow from $1 million to $10 million, the margins would decrease and it gets even harder to make returns. We simply observed the reality that all these great companies had reached a point between a lack of access to capital and simply not being able to keep doing what they do. We thought, if we acquire 10-20 of these we would have the scale to build best in breed supply chain, marketing and so on. We would fix the problem.\u201d But in reality Thrasio has been building a business spanning a number of different consumer categories, geographies and demographics. Integrating even similar businesses can be costly and difficult (and it often goes wrong). And aggregators generally position themselves as solving those issues with tech, but in some cases, aggregators are not building as much technology as you might think: they are buying third-party tools to help with SEO, fulfillment and more. In that context, the move to bring in Greeley whose roles at Amazon included running its global Prime program suggests that the company wanted a more seasoned executive at the helm to keep its long-term strategy on the right path, especially given Greeley\u2019s background and track record in the consumer marketplace space. Cashman has also been grappling with another controversy outside of Thrasio. He is facing a lawsuit being brought against him by Stacy Chang, an investor who left Founders Fund to join Cashman in a new venture capital firm called Arrowside Capital. She alleges he dismissed her after deciding not to move forward with the firm, and she is seeking damages, including for work she says she did over a six-month period. Thrasio also alludes to growing too big, too fast in the joint memo to employees. \u201cNow, as we assess our strategy for the road ahead, we need to take the time to properly absorb and grow the businesses we have acquired, make sure we have rigorous processes and controls, and then look to re-scale our team in the optimal areas for growth.\u201d They went on to say that some of that included \u201crefining\u201d its M&amp;A team to be able to handle acquisitions and integrate them into the company\u2019s processes, as well as \u201cundergoing our transformation in an environment with a pandemic, a war, a sharp rise in inflation, supply chain disruptions and changing consumer behaviors.\u201d This is unlikely to be the final chapter for Thrasio, which remains the owner of hundreds of big-selling e-commerce brands. But the big question will be whether it continues as a single entity under Greeley, and whether it continues to grow as it has; or whether it takes a course to \u201crationalize\u201d some of the many investments and acquisitions it has made over the years. \u201cJust four years ago, the innovative team at Thrasio created an entirely new way for this community of entrepreneurs to achieve their business goals and see the reach of their products expand \u2013 and Thrasio continues to blaze the trail,\u201d Greeley noted in a statement today. \u201cIts been truly remarkable \u2013 and its still early in a marketplace with nearly $400 billion in total third-party sales in 2021 and trillions more in the broader retail ecosystem.\u201d E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods"

        "Extracted Article": "Digital mortgage company Better.com has conducted its third mass layoff in less than five months, citing a declining mortgage market, according to an email to employees seen by TechCrunch. TechCrunch recently reported that the move was coming. It is unclear at the time of writing how many people were affected by the layoffs, but sources familiar with internal happenings at the company estimate that it ranges from 1,200 to 1,500, meaning that the company has effectively reduced its headcount from about 10,000 in December to less than 5,000 now. According to the subject line of the e-mail sent to all employees that went out at 8 a.m. EST today, the \u201cU.S. Production Workforce\u201d would be impacted. Sources familiar with the matter said Better Real Estate was among the impacted departments. The unit was at one time the \u201cbaby\u201d of the company, sources say, and where a big chunk of investment dollars were going to go in 2022. Better had been vocal about its desire to build out its purchase experience and move beyond digital lending to help people find and purchase homes \u2014 hence changing its name from Better Mortgage to just Better. It was also working to expand value-added offerings like title and homeowner\u2019s insurance as part of its product suite. Its refinance team is also believed to have been heavily impacted. In an email to employees, Richard Benson-Armer the company\u2019s newly appointed chief people, performance and culture officer told employees that layoffs would occur today and affected employees would receive a \u201cone-on-one\u201d phone call from \u201cleaders.\u201d The companys CEO Vishal Garg infamously laid off 900 people, or 9% of its workforce, via Zoom in December. Better then laid off another 3,100 people on March 8. In that round, affected employees knew they were going to be laid off when they saw a severance check in their Workday accounts \u2014 the payroll software the company uses. In the email to employees, Benson-Armer said: Team, As you know, our team has been focused on ensuring that our business is nimble, able to weather industry headwinds and placed in the strongest position possible for the future by implementing operational changes, reducing costs and making the difficult but necessary decisions to reduce our workforce. As the mortgage environment in which we operate continues to indicate further declines ahead, we have to do more to ensure Better is appropriately positioned, financially and operationally, to navigate this changing environment. It is through this that we will continue to work to further position Better on its pathway to profitability. With this in mind, we have made the difficult decision to make another substantial cut to our production workforce in the United States. This is not the measure we wanted to take. But, this is both prudent and necessary for the health of our business. We continue to prioritize transparency and care as we go through this process, and our leaders will be spending today making one-on-one calls to notify departing colleagues of this news. If you are impacted, you will receive a call today to learn the news personally and discuss next steps. We are providing comprehensive severance packages encompassing compensation, healthcare coverage and access to outplacement services to all departing employees, who will receive: Compensation: A minimum of 60 working days \u2013 and as much as 80 working days \u2013 of cash severance payments Healthcare Coverage: Company healthcare benefits for those enrolled will remain effective until the end of the month (April 30, 2022) after which impacted employees will be able to opt into using COBRA, with Better covering the premiums until July 31 2022. Outplacement services: Access to dedicated, one-to-one assistance for resume and candidate branding services, career coaching, job concierge search and support services and personalized job and networking opportunities through Better\u2019s partnership with Randstad RiseSmart, a global leader in career transition support. As we work to streamline our operations and strengthen our business in the face of these prevailing headwinds, we are also making changes to our footprint in select locations to achieve further cost savings. If this impacts you or your team, you will receive additional information about next steps of the transition in the coming weeks. Thank you for all of your hard work, care for our customers, and commitment to our purpose in these difficult times. Benson-Armer had been serving in the head people role since the departure of Alex D\u2019Amico, who left in November, according to Inman. Notably, he is also a partner at Activant Capital, one of Better.com\u2019s earliest investors as well as a former McKinsey consultant. TechCrunch reached out to Better.com for comment but had not heard back at the time of writing. Also at the time of writing, employees were still waiting to hear if they were among the impacted employees. Meanwhile, a list of people who have been laid off from Better is being compiled on Coda. This is a developing story. Better.com teaches us how not to downsize a company"

        "Extracted Article": "Austin unicorn Workrise has laid off an unspecified number of employees as it exits several verticals and seeks to divest parts of its business. The company, which has built a workforce management platform for the skilled trades, said that it was laying off employees but declined to say how many. Just last May, TechCrunch reported that the company had raised $300 million at a $2.9 billion valuation. At that time, Workrise currently had more than 600 employees in 25 offices. A user on anonymous community app for the workplace, Blind, said that the layoff affected 450 people but that number has not been confirmed with the company. You may know the startup better by its former name, RigUp. The company was founded in 2014 as a marketplace for on-demand services and skilled labor in the energy industry. It changed its name in early 2021 to reflect a new emphasis on industries other than just oil and gas after the industry took a beating in recent years. But it looks like the company is returning to its roots after a pandemic pivot didnt work out as planned. In a statement, Workrise spokesperson Dan Bank told TechCrunch: In recent months, Workrise has engaged on a go-forward strategy supporting skilled workers in the energy industry. In this pursuit, Workrise has decided to exit verticals that no longer align with its go-forward strategy. Unfortunately, many of our colleagues will be impacted as part of this restructuring and we have made the difficult decision to reduce headcount. This was done after careful deliberation and is a result of positions being eliminated, departments consolidated and an overall shift in growth priorities. This was not an easy process, but we believe this realignment is in the best interest of the company as we move forward helping skilled laborers grow their career in our core industries, including oil &amp; gas and renewables. In an internal email to employees obtained by TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Xuan Yong noted that the expansion into new markets beyond oil and gas was aimed at diversifying Workrise\u2019s business and to support a broader range of skilled tradespeople. He added that the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated the company\u2019s investment in those markets. He went on to say that since then, the company has decided it can \u201cmake the greatest impact\u201d in energy. \u201cWith this in mind, we evaluated the rest of our portfolio and saw that some businesses were not the right complement, both from a financial and product perspective. The diverse range of businesses and workers we served created enormous complexity, which impeded us from effectively scaling and growing them. It was harder to deliver a worker-first product when we were spread across several industries with very specific needs. That is why we made the very difficult decision to exit certain verticals to focus on energy \u2013 oil &amp; gas and renewables,\u201d Yong wrote. As a result, he said the company would \u201cimmediately right-size\u201d parts of its business and divest from others. He added that Workrise has signed buyers for one of its businesses and is exploring sales for the rest. Yong also wrote: \u201cIn the immediate future, we will have less clients and workers to support. And the sad reality is we will have to reduce our corporate workforce to support our go-forward business. This wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but it\u2019s necessary for the future success of our company.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the company has had to lay off workers. In 2020, Workrise laid off one-quarter of its corporate employees as the industry took a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, it appears that a pandemic pivot did not work out for the company. At the time of its last raise, the company told me that its gross revenue had tripled since 2018, going from just under $300 million to about $900 million to close out 2020. This article was updated post-publication to include an estimate of how many workers were affected Workrise, once known as RigUp, raises $300M at a $2.9B valuation"

A Hopin spokesperson, who confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, also confirmed that employees impacted by Hopin\u2019s layoffs will receive three months of compensation, health benefits and their laptops. The company also removed the one-year cliff for stock vesting and is using RiseSmart, a recruitment agency, to help them with job hunting. Following unprecedented growth and several acquisitions, we are reorganizing to align with our goals for greater efficiency and sustainable growth,\u201d the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to part ways with teammates, and we\u2019re deeply grateful for the impact they\u2019ve had while at Hopin.\u201d According to a screenshot obtained by TechCrunch, Hopin CEO Johnny Boufarhat posted a statement in Hopin\u2019s Slack about the reorganization. \u201cWe are committed to becoming more efficient while ensuring we have the required financial discipline and organizational rigor,\u201d the co-founder wrote. He also pointed out that the layoffs were to \u201csolve overlaps and duplications that crept into the business\u201d following rapid growth and acquisitions. Notably, Hopin acquired five companies in just 2021, including a $250 million purchase of StreamYard. The statement strikes a different tone than merely 11 months prior, when Hopin closed a $400 million raise at a $5.65 billion valuation. Then Boufarhat told TechCrunch that \u201chis company intends on being operationally IPO-ready next year.\u201d The venture-backed startup amassed up to $1 billion in known venture capital over a two-year window, from top investors including Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Accel, Slack Fund, Coatue, Salesforce Ventures and others, per Crunchbase. Reporter Gergely Orosz, who broke news earlier today that layoffs were underway at the unicorn, noted in their piece that \u201cHopin\u2019s biggest problem is how they were blindsided by demand during the pandemic and were unprepared for the post-COVID world.\u201d It\u2019s a similar story a startup loses discipline in pursuit of rapid growth to keep up with pandemic-amplified demand that we\u2019ve seen ripple across other industries over the past weeks. Peloton has been perhaps the harshest signal of this easy come, easy go trend, this week cutting 2,800 jobs and removing its CEO John Foley from the helm of the company. The move comes after the fitness hardware company had to halt production of treadmill and bike products, due to slowing demand from consumers.

        "Extracted Article": "Ahead of today\u2019s Peloton earnings report, John Foley announced that he is stepping down as CEO. The longtime chief executive will remain on as executive chair, with former Spotify CFO Barry McCarthy stepping into his old role. \u201cBarry is an incredible leader who has held senior executive roles at Spotify and Netflix and is a longtime advisor and board member at public and private technology companies,\u201d Foley said in an open letter. \u201cThis appointment is the culmination of a months-long succession plan that I\u2019ve been working on with our Board of Directors, and we are thrilled to have found in Barry the perfect leader for the next chapter of Peloton. I look forward to working with him and invite you to welcome him with open arms.\u201d The firm is also cutting 2,800 jobs globally, around 20% of its corporate workforce. Cuts will come \u201cat every level of the organization.\u201d Such moves arrive at the tail end of a roller-coaster couple of years for the connected fitness brand, culminating with a drop in demand. In addition to Foley, Peloton\u2019s president of five years, William Lynch, will be transitioning to a nonexecutive director role on the company\u2019s board. Foley also notes that his wife, Jill Foley who has served as VP of Apparel at the brand will be transitioning away from the role. \u201cShe founded and built our incredible Apparel business from the ground up,\u201d Foley wrote. \u201cWe are all very proud and grateful to Jill and the team that has helped her develop that sector of our business into what it is today.\u201d Shareholders were convinced some dramatic changes were necessary for the company, which was riding high not long ago amid a surge of pandemic-fueled demand. The brand had a good deal of wind in its sails prior to COVID-related shutdowns, amassing an almost cult-like following, but the widespread closure of gyms proved a massive accelerator. After an initial bottleneck in supply, the company invested $400 million in U.S. production back in May 2021. This year, meanwhile, has thus far been marked by reports of slowed demand and corrective action. Peloton hired consulting firm McKinsey as its examined layoffs. Soon after, the company reportedly halted all production of its treadmill and bike products. Foley broke from pre-earning silence to confirm the former and deny the latter, stating at the time: [W]e\u2019ve found ourselves in the middle of a once-in-a-hundred year event with the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we anticipated would happen over the course of three years happened in months during 2020, and into 2021. We worked quickly and diligently to meet the demand head-on at a time when the world really needed us, in large part thanks to how hard you worked every day. We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth. In January, investment firm Blackwells Capital called on the board to terminate Foley and investigate a Peloton sale, noting: \u201cRemarkably, the Company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders. And no wonder, the latter, given that Peloton underperformed every other company in the Nasdaq 100 over the last twelve months.\u201d More recently, Peloton has reportedly been courting potential acquisitions from companies including Amazon. \u201cWe are open to exploring any opportunity that could create value for Peloton shareholders,\u201d Foley said at the time, addressing those rumors. As The Wall Street Journal noted, the rapid appointment of a new CEO could point to a company not quite ready to sell at least not in its current state. In his letter today, Foley addressed the ongoing changes and challenges in the wake of the pandemic. For many of us, the last two years have been a whirlwind of a learning experience. We navigated COVID-19 together, did our best to meet unprecedented demand, increased the size of our team, and grew our product portfolio. But with this growth, we have also faced our fair share of challenges / pivots / the unexpected. We often had to act quickly, with limited visibility. For example, in the face of supply chain disruptions and delivery delays, we invested heavily in near-term capacity, inventories, and logistics to protect our Member experience. However, as our post-COVID demand picture looks different than anticipated, these investments no longer align with how we intend to operate our business going forward. Along with the layoffs, Peloton is also abandoning the U.S. manufacturing plans Lynch announced last May, instead relying on third parties, as well as Tonic, a bike manufacturer it acquired in 2019. The company will also be significantly reducing its first-party warehouse and delivery operations. \u201cWere also taking a clear-eyed look at our culture and, if were honest with ourselves, we see some things that need to change,\u201d Foley wrote. \u201cOne of these things is optimizing processes for making decisions which includes creating more space for debate to get to the right decisions, empowering the right folks to be decision-makers, and supporting decisions once made so we can enhance our execution. You can expect this to be a priority for Barry and our leadership team in the coming year.\u201d The company has also announced plans to establish profitability and sustainable free cash flow, according to a press release: Once these actions are fully implemented, the company expects to achieve at least $800 million of annual run-rate cost savings through operating expense efficiencies and significant margin improvement in its Connected Fitness category. The company will also reduce its planned capital expenditures in 2022 by approximately $150 million. The restructuring program is expected to result in approximately $130 million in cash charges related to severance as well as other exit and restructuring activities and $80 million in non-cash charges. The majority of the charges will be recorded in fiscal year 2022. Foley and the company promised to answer more questions during today\u2019s earnings call."

        "Extracted Article": "Glossier, the popular beauty brand led by former blogger Emily Weiss, let go of 80 of its corporate employees today, according to an internal email obtained by Modern Retail. The cuts, which amount to around one-third of Glossier\u2019s corporate workforce, will primarily impact the company\u2019s technology team. \u201c[W]e are shifting our technology strategy to leverage external partners for parts of our platform that we\u2019re currently maintaining internally,\u201d Weiss wrote in the email announcing the layoffs to staff. The email recounts some of the company\u2019s recent mistakes, including prioritizing strategic projects that \u201cdistracted\u201d the company from its core beauty business and that executives \u201cgot ahead of ourselves on hiring.\u201d The tech team layoffs are notable for a beauty retailer that has often described itself as a technology company. In numerous interviews throughout the past two years, Weiss and other executives have emphasized the company\u2019s focus on its direct-to-consumer online shipping model and obsession with iterating the customer experience based on feedback. The company built its own point-of-sale system and commerce APIs in-house, allowing them to deliver a seamless customer experience, former Glossier CTO Bryan Mahoney said in 2018. Founded in 2014, Glossier is widely touted as one of the earliest breakout successes of the DTC model, and raised its Series E last July at a $1.8 billion valuation from Lone Pine Capital, Sequoia, Forerunner Ventures and others. E-commerce sales typically account for 80% of Glossier\u2019s revenue, the Business of Fashion reported last July. Despite its fundraising success, Glossier\u2019s ascent has oftentimes been far from smooth. The company laid off its entire retail staff and closed all its physical locations, including its flagship New York City store, in August 2020. It also grappled with the fallout from an open letter written by some of its employees of color sharing their experiences of enduring racism from managers in its stores, prompting a public apology from Weiss. Nearly a year later, the company seemed to change course on its decision to double down on e-commerce alone, saying it planned to use the Series E funding to open three new permanent physical stores in Seattle, Los Angeles and London as well as reopen its New York City location. It hoped to use the retail locations to build brand awareness and encourage customers to create content, areas Glossier became well-known for in its early days through its distinctive, millennial-pink aesthetic and clever use of social media marketing. The company\u2019s website currently says customers should \u201cstay tuned\u201d for more retail store openings this year. Current and former Glossier employees can contact Anita Ramaswamy by e-mail at aramaswamy.techcrunch@gmail.com or on Signal, a secure encrypted messaging app, at 480 463 4056. It may not be as glamorous as D2C, but beauty tech is big money"
