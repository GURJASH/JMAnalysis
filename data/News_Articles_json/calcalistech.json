Israeli startup Electriq Global has accumulated liabilities of approximately NIS 105 million ($29.4M), including debts to shareholders. On Thursday, the Haifa District Court, at the company's request and that of its employees, issued an order to freeze proceedings. The court also appointed Attorney Alona Baumgarten as the company's trustee to oversee its rehabilitation. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2025 Founded in 2013, Electriq Global operates in the hydrogen sector and is developing a circular platform for the storage and release of hydrogen gas. This effort aligns with global initiatives to develop technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate the transition to green energy. According to the company's application, its first planned product line is backup generators powered by solid hydrogen. While Electriq Global previously employed about 30 workers, its workforce has now been reduced to six. The company also operated a development center in Tirat Carmel and laboratories spanning approximately 1,200 square meters. Since its founding, Electriq Global has raised approximately $25 million in funding. In its court filing, the company cited financial difficulties stemming from stalled negotiations with a Dutch investor, who froze an investment of \u20ac25 million due to the security situation in Israel and the ongoing war. The request for court protection and rehabilitation was supported by an affidavit from director Baruch Halpert. The request for an order to initiate rehabilitation proceedings was submitted after 13 current and former employees, represented by Attorney Ofir Ronen, petitioned for a trustee to be appointed with the company's consent. They claimed that Electriq Global failed to pay salaries for January 2025 and could not fully cover February wages for both current and laid-off employees. Electriq Global said in a statement: \u201cFollowing the employees' request to appoint a trustee and initiate proceedings, the company is working to formulate the best possible arrangement for both employees and suppliers. There is significant interest in the company\u2019s technology, and we hope shareholders will support its continued operation to maximize its potential. The company will work to establish a debt settlement plan and will submit an application to the court in the coming days.\u201d"

        "Extracted Article": "Cybersecurity startup NanoLock collapses, seeks court-appointed trustee . The Israeli firm, once backed by $27 million in funding, cites war-related financial strain and cash flow crisis as it halts operations. The Israeli cybersecurity company NanoLock Security filed a request on Wednesday with the Central District Court for the appointment of a temporary trustee due to its insolvency. The request aims to preserve the company\u2019s assets and retain some of its employees while urgently seeking to maximize the realization of its assets through a sale of its operations. According to the filing, the company has debts of approximately 7 million shekels ($1.97 million) and an additional $2.5 million in debt to shareholders. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2025 NanoLock is a startup specializing in the protection and management of industrial controllers used across various industries, including food, energy, ports, hospitals, and manufacturing. The company employs 26 people, but in recent days, it has notified employees of the cessation of operations and the termination of their employment. NanoLock was founded in 2017 by CEO Eran Fine. The filing states that many controllers produced by various suppliers lack basic cybersecurity protections. NanoLock\u2019s technology is designed not only to protect these controllers from unauthorized changes but also to provide management, monitoring, and enforcement capabilities for operational and policy changes. The company is owned by a parent company registered in Delaware, USA. According to the request, NanoLock\u2019s customers in Israel include Israel Chemicals and Tosaf. The company was also in advanced discussions, though without finalized installations, with Sheba Tel Hashomer Hospital and Ashdod Port. Additionally, NanoLock had ongoing engagements at various stages with other companies in Israel. Since its founding, the American parent company has raised approximately $27 million in multiple investment rounds and received $2.5 million in shareholder loans. Of these funds, approximately $28 million was invested in NanoLock. The company also secured a $2 million loan from Discount Bank, of which about $1 million has been repaid. Additionally, it received grants totaling approximately $3 million from the Israel Innovation Authority. The filing claims that despite investors pouring tens of millions of shekels into the company, changing market conditions\u2014including the war and its impact on customers\u2014along with difficulties in developing specific product features and the long sales cycles required to engage customers, have led to severe cash flow problems. As a result, the company now faces financial distress. The request further asserts that, given the company\u2019s lack of funds to continue operations and product development, along with its outstanding debts, it has no choice but to cease operations. The company argues that appointing a trustee is the only viable option to maximize its remaining value, potentially through the sale of its operations, intellectual property, or technology, which requires significant effort and investment to develop. Attorneys Yonat Meir and Shai Piade, representing the company, stated: \\\"Over the past year, and in the shadow of the war, NanoLock Security has faced significant financial and operational challenges that have affected its business. Given these circumstances and the difficulties involved, the company has turned to the court to initiate appropriate proceedings. NanoLock thanks all its employees, customers, and partners for their support and trust over the years.\\\""

With the completion of the merger between Israeli digital advertising company Outbrain and French company Teads, the merged entity will part ways with about 200 employees, most of them outside Israel. This move is part of what is known in the business world as the realization of synergies, meaning the elimination of duplicate roles. The companies expect annual cost savings following the merger to reach $65 to $75 million by 2026. The deal consists of a cash payment of $625 million, $25 million in future payments, 35 million Outbrain shares valued at approximately $169 million at the time of signing, and $105 million in convertible shares above a price of $10. This is a unique transaction structure for the high-tech industry, more reminiscent of a leveraged buyout, which will also give a significant stake in the merged company to the owners of Teads. Following the deal, the European telecom corporation Altice, the current owner of Teads, will appoint two directors to the company, who will join the eight current directors of Outbrain. To finance the deal, Outbrain secured significant credit from Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and other banks. The merged company will have 2,000 employees, 20,000 advertisers on its platform, and is expected to reach 2 billion consumers per month. Although Outbrain is technically the acquiring party, the merged company will be called Teads, maintaining the stronger and more recognizable brand. David Kostman, CEO of Outbrain, will serve as CEO of the new company while also holding the position of chairman at Israeli software company NICE. Outbrain reported that in the fourth quarter, its last before the merger, it generated revenues of $68.3 million, with projected revenues of $236.1 million for 2024. Teads ended the quarter with revenues of $119.9 million and closed the year with $386.6 million. The French company's adjusted EBITDA is also higher\u2014$122.7 million projected for 2024 compared to $37.3 million for Outbrain. Together, the two companies generate revenues of $623 million and an adjusted operating profit of $230 million. Outbrain is moving closer to the traditional advertising market with this merger, acquiring a company considered a pioneer in video-based advertising. Outbrain had previously courted Teads, but the talks did not materialize into a deal. Teads was sold in 2017 to Patrick Drahi's Altice Media Corporation for $307 million, but Drahi recently sought to divest non-core assets, creating an opportunity for Outbrain. Drahi exited the deal with a significant profit, securing $625 million in cash, a 40% stake, two board seats in the merged company, and additional future payments contingent on meeting certain performance goals. About a year ago, Yaron Galai, founder and co-CEO of Outbrain, stepped down, leaving Kostman as the sole CEO. Galai resigned after Outbrain struggled to achieve significant growth following its 2021 IPO on the Nasdaq, where it was valued at $1.2 billion, subsequently losing nearly 80% of its market value."

The developer of Coin Master and Family Island said global staff cuts are part of an \u201corganizational restructuring implemented to align the company\u2019s structure with its strategy.\\\"  Gaming unicorn Moon Active recently laid off dozens of employees in Israel and worldwide. The company operates a large development center in Kyiv, along with offices in Romania, Belarus, and Lithuania, and employs approximately 2,500 people. In 2021, the company was valued at $5 billion after raising $300 million in a secondary funding round. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2025 Since its founding in 2011, Moon Active has raised only $10 million in equity funding, with all subsequent funding rounds directed toward secondary sales of shares by employees and investors. The $300 million secondary round in November 2021 was led by Insight Partners, which invested $125 million in Moon Active at the beginning of 2020 at a valuation of $1.25 billion. Moon Active\u2019s investors also include Andalusian Private Capital, Gigi Levy-Weiss, Guy Gamzu and David Alliance. Moon Active's flagship game is Coin Master, which last year surpassed the $6 billion mark in income, according to a report by Sensor Tower Store Intelligence. Coin Master was released in 2016 and the title has raked in around $1.2 billion annually since 2020. Coin Master is a mobile game in which players spin a slot machine to collect coins, allowing them to construct and upgrade their villages. Additionally, players can raid other players' villages to steal resources and progress further in the game. Moon Active stated: \\\"The company has grown significantly in recent years, completing several mergers and acquisitions, and ended 2024 with record revenues exceeding $2 billion. In the first quarter of 2025, an organizational restructuring was implemented to align the company\u2019s structure with its strategy.\\\" Moon Active, which is also behind popular title Family Island, acquired the mobile game Zen Match, along with the associated team located in Istanbul, from a Turkish mobile game developer, Good Job Games, in December 2022. The scope of the deal was not revealed, but was estimated to be in the region of $100-150 million."

        "Extracted Article": "Amazon-backed robotics startup BionicHIVE shuts down with $18M debt. The Sderot-based company blames war and lost investor confidence for its financial collapse.  The Israeli robotics manufacturer BionicHIVE has accumulated debts of approximately NIS 66 million (approximately $18 million) and has filed a request with the Be'er Sheva District Court for liquidation, alongside a stay of proceedings and the appointment of a temporary trustee. The company gained international recognition in January 2021 after billionaire Elon Musk praised its technology on Twitter, writing that \\\"The robot future is coming\\\". Judge Yaakov Persky approved the company's request and issued an order halting all proceedings. This means that no legal actions can be initiated against the company, nor can its debts be collected. The judge also ruled that a temporary trustee would be appointed, with their identity to be determined in a hearing scheduled for Monday. According to BionicHIVE, its financial collapse was directly caused by the effects of the \u201cSwords of Iron\u201d war on the Israeli economy, particularly on the high-tech sector, which relies heavily on investment capital. The company stated that, despite significant efforts, it struggled to recover due to its primary funding pipeline\u2014investment from foreign investors\u2014being cut off. This was attributed to investors' reluctance to invest in Israeli companies during the conflict. Additionally, the company cited other war-related circumstances that resulted in a severe cash flow shortage, preventing it from continuing operations or meeting financial obligations. BionicHIVE, a privately held company based in the city of Sderot, was founded in 2014 by Liran Raizer, Itamar Levy, Tomer Amit, and Olivier Haddad. At its peak, the company employed 30 workers. Among its significant investors is the global e-commerce giant Amazon. \u201cAmazon has recognized BionicHIVE for its differentiated solution capable of optimizing safety around repeated tasks, at any height, in the supply chain workplace, and this is the kind of technology that\u2019s pulling innovation forward,\u201d said Katherine Chen, Head of the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, at the time. Since its establishment, the company has focused on developing robotic systems for warehouses and logistics operations. Its flagship product, SqUID, is an advanced robotic system designed to automate the collection, organization, and distribution of goods in logistics warehouses. According to the company, the system is unique in its ability to convert a manual warehouse into an automated one with minimal investment while maintaining seamless collaboration between human personnel and robots. The robots operate autonomously on the warehouse floor and, when required to reach elevated locations, attach to rails installed on the shelves. This allows them to replace human workers in picking, organizing, and storing tasks at any height or location. The company, represented by attorneys Mazal Maru and Guy Azulay from the Agmon & Tulchinsky law firm, stated that it has raised approximately $15 million from investors since its founding, along with an additional $3 million from the Israel Innovation Authority. As of now, the company has developed around 30 robots, which it claims have significant business potential. BionicHIVE also revealed that, prior to the outbreak of the war, it was in advanced negotiations to secure additional investments and finalize agreements with existing customers for the commercial distribution of its next-generation robot systems. However, operations were abruptly halted when the company's offices in Sderot were closed due to the area being declared a military zone. Many employees, including two of the founders, were evacuated from their homes, and some were called up for military service. As part of its court filing, the company disclosed liabilities totaling approximately NIS 66.6 million, with the majority (around NIS 65 million) owed to various investors and NIS 700,000 owed to employees."

Mobileye is shutting down its lidar sensor development division, which employs 100 people. While Mobileye, which is focused on developing autonomous vehicles, will try to find internal positions for some employees, it is estimated that most will be laid off. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 This move represents significant cost savings for Mobileye, as the division's development expenses were projected to reach $60 million, with no expected revenue. Lidar is an advanced sensor, one of the key components of autonomous vehicles, but Mobileye has yet to complete internal development and currently uses sensors from the Israeli company Innoviz. Innoviz is currently valued at only $88 million, so acquiring it could be more cost-effective for Mobileye than continuing to fund internal lidar development, which has already consumed over $100 million. The lidar industry was once considered one of the most promising fields in the sector, but recently the prices of these sensors have dropped significantly. Meanwhile, advancements in AI raise questions about their necessity. About five years ago, Elon Musk famously declared that lidar is not essential for autonomous vehicles and serves mainly as a redundancy measure. Lidar is a type of advanced radar that can operate effectively in low-visibility conditions, such as darkness or stormy weather. Mobileye issued a statement: \\\"As part of our regular review of the long-term technology roadmap, we now believe that the availability of next-generation FMCW lidar is less essential to our roadmap for eyes-off systems. This decision was based on a variety of factors, including substantial progress on our EyeQ6-based computer vision perception, increased clarity on the performance of our internally developed imaging radar, and continued better-than-expected cost reductions in third-party time-of-flight lidar units.\u201d Mobileye will continue its internal development of imaging radar, which is expected to reach production next year and is considered a strategic priority. This is another major shift in Mobileye\u2019s operations this year, part of the company\u2019s broader efforts to reduce expenses. Earlier this year, the company shut down its original driver-assistance systems, which warned drivers about lane departures or imminent collisions. As part of that restructuring, 130 employees were let go, 90 of whom were based in Israel. Following the current round of cuts, Mobileye\u2019s workforce will shrink to around 3,500 employees, though many open positions remain listed on the company\u2019s website. Mobileye has been facing a slowdown since late 2023, and its market value recently dropped below $10 billion for the first time. This decline is compounded by speculation that Intel, which still owns 88% of Mobileye's shares, may sell them to address its own liquidity challenges. Amid falling revenues, which have led to several downward revisions of its annual sales forecast (currently expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, $1 billion less than originally projected), Mobileye has posted a significant operating loss, nearing $100 million in the last quarter. Mobileye's shares have plunged by 73% since the beginning of the year, bringing the company\u2019s value to $9.3 billion."

The volume of real estate transactions in the US has decreased significantly in the last two years, leading to a reduction in the company's activities that provide data tools for apartment buyers and agents. However, sister company Madlan's activities in Israel will continue as usual. The proptech company Localize, a sister company of Madlan, is ceasing its operations in the United States. Madlan's activities in Israel will continue as usual. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Localize was established in 2016 by Amir Winstok and Asaf Rubin four years after they set up Madlan, with the aim of simplifying the complex processes involved in buying a house through the use of technology and data. The CEO of the company is Omer Granot. The company has raised about $70 million to date, with the last fundraising round in 2021. The round was led by Pitango Growth with additional participation from Israeli bank Mizrahi-Tefahot. Previous investors include: Zvi Limon, Avigdor Willenz, Lip-Bu Tan, and Noam Gottesman. At that time, there was also a significant conflict between the company's founders. The reason for the closure of the company's operations is the crisis in the American real estate market, which has experienced two particularly difficult years due to high interest rates and other factors. The company stated, \\\"Macro data, with an emphasis on interest rates as well as regulatory changes, are creating a deep crisis and uncertainty in the U.S. real estate market, which is currently at a two-decade low. For this reason, we made the painful decision that this is the right time to close Localize's activity in the USA. During our years of activity in the USA, we acquired knowledge and technology that we will explore applying in other markets in the future. We would like to thank the dedicated Localize employees and the loyal investors who accompanied us throughout the years of our operations.\\\" Regarding Madlan, it was stated, \\\"Localize's activities are carried out completely separately from Madlan, within the framework of a separate company. Therefore, the cessation of operations in the United States has no effect on Madlan's activities, which focus on the local market and provide the most advanced and intelligent real estate solutions in Israel.\\\""

Once one of the most promising medical startups in Israel, DayTwo raised $85 million in total, but failed to navigate market challenges.  DayTwo, once one of the most promising medical startups in Israel, is closing its doors for good. The company's management informed the remaining few dozen employees on Monday that it will be shutting down, Calcalist has learned. DayTwo declined to comment on the news. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 As sad as the closure is, it is not entirely surprising. About a year ago, DayTwo laid off most of its employees, leaving only a small core team focused on supporting existing customers and exploring new development directions. At its peak, DayTwo employed hundreds of workers. DayTwo was founded based on the research and development of two professors from the Weizmann Institute, Eran Segal and Eran Elinav, and was established with the assistance and funding of Marius Nacht, the founder of Check Point, who in recent years has focused primarily on investments in medical startups. The company was founded in 2015 and raised a substantial $85 million over its lifetime from investors including the aMoon fund, the Israeli 10D fund specializing in early-stage companies, the Samsung Next fund, Cathay Innovation Ventures, Poalim Capital Markets, La\u2019maison Fund, and Micron Ventures. In 2018, DAYTWO also received a small investment from basketball player Omri Casspi, who used the company\u2019s kit and even served as its spokesperson in the Israeli market. DayTwo\u2019s goal was to develop and market kits that tailored proper nutrition for diabetics based on their stool samples. The unique aspect of the company\u2019s nutrition recommendations was that they didn\u2019t necessarily advocate traditional diet foods instead, they sometimes recommended that it was healthier for individuals to eat foods like pizza, hamburgers with fries, or bread with butter. The analysis of the stool samples allowed for personalized recommendations, based on genetics and blood sugar tests, with tracking available through an app. While DayTwo showed promising results in improving blood sugar levels, the results in terms of weight loss were inconclusive. Additionally, there was criticism that some of the foods highly rated by DayTwo\u2019s system were not healthy, even if they helped lower blood sugar levels. Despite initial enthusiasm and distribution through Maccabi and Clalit health services, which offered the kits for a one-time fee, DayTwo\u2019s business model ultimately failed to be profitable. Four years ago, the company\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Lihi Segal, left the company. More recently, the company was managed by Gal Gonen, who also served as CFO. The plan was to enter the American market with a subscription model aimed at organizations and insurance companies, some of which had signed agreements with the Israeli company. However, it seems that the popularity of Ozempic-type diabetes injections, which help both maintain appropriate blood sugar levels and support weight loss, undermined DayTwo\u2019s target market of diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. At the beginning of 2023, DayTwo\u2019s cooperation with Maccabi and Clalit ended, and since then, new kits have not been available for purchase, although support for existing customers continued. Additionally, in 2023, the company sold its laboratory and transitioned to working exclusively with distributors in the U.S. At the end of 2022, DayTwo announced significant cutbacks, including the dismissal of dozens of employees in Israel and the U.S. At that time, the company employed 150 people, split equally between Israel and the U.S."

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The development of generative artificial intelligence technologies that perform functions similar to OrCam's reading device for the blind using smartphones has harmed its bottom line and ultimately resulted in its decision to concentrate on developing hearing aids. OrCam stated, \\\"The technological progress in image processing by language models makes the need for further development of the Low Vision products unnecessary. Therefore, the focus is shifted in favor of the Hear division, which is entering the marketing and sales phase.\\\" OrCam planned to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic after it approached a revenue rate of $100 million and profitability. In March 2021, it raised $50 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, aiming for a valuation above $2.5 billion in the IPO. However, these plans have stalled due to the war and the freeze on purchases from Arab countries, which were a significant growth engine for the Israeli company. At its peak, the company employed about 400 workers. It conducted the first round of layoffs at the end of 2022, laying off several dozen workers."

After raising over $60 million, and a month after unveiling the Spacetop G1, the Israeli startup is parting ways with 20 of around 60 employees, announcing that it is shifting its focus from hardware distribution to software distribution Israeli startup Sightful, which develops a laptop using spatial computing to offer users an AR \u2018monitor\u2019 through the use of glasses, is laying off 20 employees, comprising a third of its workforce. The layoffs are part of a strategic decision to focus solely on software development and discontinue building and marketing a complete laptop. As a result, the company's hardware department has been disbanded. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Sightful, established in 2020 and revealed only a year ago with over $60 million in fundraising from Aleph, Symbol, and Corner Ventures, was considered one of Israel's most intriguing companies. Founded by Tamir Berliner and Tomer Kahan, who previously worked at Magic Leap and PrimeSense, the company developed a laptop that replaces the physical screen with AR glasses, allowing users to open dozens of virtual screens. This innovation enables comfortable work in public places without compromising privacy. Sightful started selling the computer, called \\\"Spacetop,\\\" about a year ago for $2,000 and recently relaunched it under the name Spacetop G1. Shortly after the relaunch and amid Apple's release of its AR glasses, Sightful decided to abandon the hardware component and focus on marketing the operating system and software for AR computers. The company says this shift is driven by rapid technological advancements in the computing market, highlighted by global tech giants' announcements of AI-based computers. According to Sightful, this change accelerates its business model, allowing the deployment of its operating system on various computers without being \\\"locked\\\" to its own device. \u201cThis is not the path the company intended, following so quickly on the heels of the announcement of Spacetop G1 - a product designed with the necessary hardware and compute to enable spatial computing in a laptop form factor. However, this rapid advancement in the broader market is very much aligned with the company\u2019s long-term strategic vision, which has always been focused on software, bringing AR productivity to as many people as possible,\u201d the company wrote in a press release. \u201cEssentially, these market changes enabled an acceleration in Sigthful\u2019s path. That acceleration has positive aspects including a significant increase in our total addressable market and faster speed to market, but also has negative aspects including the termination of valued employees.\u201d Berliner, CEO and co-founder of Sightful, stated: \\\"The timing for implementing this strategy is earlier than we had planned, but as a dynamic startup, we must adjust and respond to changing market conditions, especially when they accelerate our plans. We continue to advocate for changing the 'mobile work world,' strongly believe in the power of augmented reality, and remain committed to our mission to free the laptop industry from the limitations of screens. This necessary shift in business focus means parting with a group of highly talented and groundbreaking individuals who were true partners in establishing our vision. We thank those who believed in us from the start and are doing everything we can to help them find new opportunities.\\\""

The Nasdaq-traded firm is laying off 100 employees in total and is continuing to reduce its presence in Israel Fintech company Pagaya is embarking on an extensive cutback process, Calcalist has learned. The company will lay off 100 employees, most of them in Israel, and Yariv Hasar, who joined Pagaya to lead its Israeli operations two years ago, will leave. The layoffs will affect all departments and all levels of management. Pagaya currently employs 540 people, of which 400 are in Israel. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 This is the second round of layoffs by Pagaya in a year and a half. At the beginning of 2023, it fired 140 employees out of the 650 it employed at the time. Most of those laid off (110) were from Israel. Consequently, Pagaya's management, which is mostly based in the U.S., continues to reduce its presence in Israel. Pagaya, which developed an engine for underwriting loans to enable the granting of credit to a wider audience, operates primarily in the American market. In Israel, its center focuses on R&D, with a small credit fund operation that faced a crisis last year after it halted redemptions for investors. The layoffs at Pagaya come a few days after a similar move by the Israeli company OrCam, which also laid off 100 employees. At this stage, it is difficult to determine whether this is a trend, but it is possible that the move in both cases is related to the war in Israel. The current cut comes shortly after Pagaya published good financial reports for the first quarter of 2024, revealing revenues of $245.2 million, a 30% increase compared to the corresponding quarter. The increase in revenues contributed to an improvement in profitability, but the company still recorded a loss of $21.2 million in the quarter. Additionally, the company's stock, which trades in New York at a value of $790 million, was added to the Russell 2000 index. Those close to the company believe that the current cuts are intended to accelerate the transition to profitability and achieve positive cash flow. In recent months, Pagaya's management has been focusing on becoming a product company. Pagaya was founded in 2016 by Gal Krubiner, who serves as CEO, Avital Pardo, who serves as CTO, and Yahav Yulzari, the company's CRO. The three founders spend most of their time at the headquarters in the U.S., and the rest of the management is also American. The current move is led by Sanjiv Das, the president of Pagaya, who joined the company last October. The company went public through a merger with a SPAC at a valuation of $8 billion in 2022."

        "Extracted Article": "Cultivated meat startup Aleph Farms lays off 30% of staff. The difficulty in securing significant investment over the past year, coupled with a marked decrease in investor interest in alternative protein and cultivated meat, led to the layoffs The Israeli cultivated meat company Aleph Farms is laying off about 30 out of around 100 employees, amounting to 30% of the company's workforce. This comes despite the company's recent initial approval from the Ministry of Health for the marketing of its products (pre-marketing approval) and its emergence in recent years as one of the world's leading companies in the cultivated meat industry. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The difficulty in securing significant investment over the past year, coupled with a marked decrease in investor interest in alternative protein and cultivated meat, is now leading to cuts in the company. Aleph Farms had hoped for a different year, according to its strategic plan and promises made to investors. However, a source in the market noted, \\\"They expected a very significant expansion this year, but the situation in Israel is difficult for the entire market. All companies are re-examining their expenses.\\\" This is against the backdrop of a global decrease in investments in the alternative protein sector, with a much more significant drop in Israel due to the flight of investors amid political and security instability. In 2023, investment in alternative protein companies in Israel dropped by about 80%, compared to a 45% decrease globally. Aleph Farms was founded in 2017 by Didier Toubia, Dr. Neta Lavon, Professor Shulamit Levenberg from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at the Technion, and the Kitchen FoodTech Hub (a partnership of the Strauss Group and the Israel Innovation Authority). To date, it has raised approximately $140 million, one of the highest amounts in the field of alternative protein in Israel. The company introduced the world's first cultured beef steak in 2018, the world's first cultured entrecote steak in 2021, and cultured collagen in 2022. Aleph Farms has announced that it will launch its first commercial product, a cultured petite steak consisting mainly of plant materials alongside about 20% cultured meat cells, grown from cells of a Black Angus cow that have not undergone any genetic modification. The field of cultured meat, which is still largely in the research and development stages, is experiencing significant difficulties worldwide. Many of the largest and most promising companies in the field are retracting past promises and failing to establish factories and release products to the market, even after receiving various regulatory approvals. For example, two companies that sold products with low percentages of cultured meat in two restaurants in the USA have stopped marketing their products. One of them sold cultured chicken nuggets at a restaurant in Singapore one day a week but has since ceased. Now, the product has started to be marketed in one supermarket in limited quantities, containing only 1% cultured chicken, with the remaining ingredients being plant-based. Aleph Farms stated: \\\"As part of the process of developing the organization and expanding our focus from research and development in Israel to global production on a large scale in various markets, we are adjusting our team structure to match the current stage of the company. Unfortunately, this means saying goodbye to about 30% of our local employees. We are taking care of all the employees affected by this decision and will support them in their job search process.\\\""

Amnon Shashua\u2019s startup is laying off 100 employees, primarily in marketing and sales, four months after cutting 50 jobs  Only three months after firing 50 employees, Amnon Shashua's OrCam is cutting its workforce again. This time, the company will lay off 100 employees, primarily marketing personnel for its reading glasses for the blind in Israel and the USA. This represents about half of the remaining employees after the February layoffs. The company will now focus mainly on sales through distributors and continued development of hearing systems. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The reason for the cuts, according to estimates, is a sharp decrease in sales to Arab countries, some of which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. A significant portion of the expected revenue for the company, founded and managed by Amnon Shashua of Mobileye fame, comes from these countries. The company concluded that these effects will not subside until the end of 2024, complicating the planned IPO. OrCam stated: \\\"Due to the ongoing process of splitting the hearing and vision divisions, combined with a challenging business climate, the company is required to enhance efficiency processes. Reducing operating costs will help the company focus its activities, accelerate the transition to profitability, and prepare for raising capital when market conditions allow.\\\" While sources close to OrCam said the war also played a role in the drop in sales, the development of generative artificial intelligence technologies that perform functions similar to OrCam's reading device for the blind using smartphones has also contributed to this decision. As a result, the company, now managed by Elad Serfaty, has decided to concentrate on developing hearing aids. OrCam, founded by Shashua and Ziv Aviram, planned to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic after it approached a revenue rate of $100 million and profitability. In March 2021, it raised $50 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, aiming for a valuation above $2.5 billion in the IPO. However, these plans have stalled due to the war and the freeze on purchases from Arab countries, which were a significant growth engine for the Israeli company. At its peak, the company employed about 400 workers. It conducted the first round of layoffs at the end of 2022, laying off several dozen workers. In February 2024, it laid off 50 more workers, leaving 220 employees before the current round of layoffs."

The Israeli startup raised $38 million since its founding in October 2017, but struggled to generate income and turned to the court due to its inability to pay its debts Israeli insurtech company Sproutt has declared insolvency less than three years after raising funding at a $200 million valuation. Last week, Sproutt submitted a request to the District Court in Tel Aviv to initiate proceedings due to its insolvency and its inability to pay a $2.2 million debt to Bank Leumi. Sproutt, established in October 2017, raised $38 million over the years and received investments from prominent insurance companies. Harel Insurance owns 4.5% of the company's shares, while Menorah Mitvtachim owns 3.5%. The deterioration of Sproutt, a digital insurance company specializing in marketing life insurance policies in the U.S., over the past three years is attributed, according to the company, to wrong strategic decisions resulting in heavy expenses and estimated losses of NIS 125 million (approximately $33 million). In addition to the debt to Leumi, the company's cash crunch also stems from debts to suppliers amounting to $740,000 and unpaid salaries for employees. Sproutt was founded by Yoav Shaham and Itai Brickner, each owning 4.2% of the company. In 2018, Sproutt founded a subsidiary called Aktibo, which centralized the company's activities in the U.S. Most of Sproutt's commercial engagements were conducted through Aktibo, allowing customers to define their lifestyle and reduce future payments based on their healthy lifestyle. However, the system did not generate enough revenue to cover marketing expenses due to several reasons, including minimal economic savings for consumers, a preference for purchasing policies through familiar insurance agents, and the high cost of marketing procedures. The commercial failure of Aktibo led to a strategic change in 2022, shifting from direct marketing to cooperation with agents and insurance agencies in the U.S. However, the cooperation with insurance agencies proved costly, jeopardizing the company's agreement with Reder Agency. Failure to make payments to Reder Agency may result in the loss of commission rights for Sproutt, as agents could utilize alternative contracts with insurance companies. The boom in investment in technology companies in 2020 and 2021 affected insurtech companies like Sproutt, but rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023 weighed heavily on insurance stocks and drew investment funds away from companies like Sproutt. Decreased investments, coupled with unsuccessful marketing ventures, led to the insolvency of the insurtech company."

After being on the verge of an IPO in 2021, Cybereason has since seen its CEO resign, hundreds of employees get laid off, all while experiencing a 90% drop in value from $3 billion to $300 million Cybereason is set to cut dozens of jobs in what would be the third round of layoffs at the cybersecurity company. In previous waves of layoffs, the company terminated the employment of hundreds of employees. These layoffs are part of a significant reorganization that the company is undergoing, including a new strategic plan. As a result, Zohar Alon, who was appointed as President of Product and R&D less than a year ago, will also be leaving the company. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 After being on the verge of an IPO in 2021, Cybereason has since seen its CEO resign, hundreds of employees get laid off, as well as effectively get taken over by its main investor SoftBank, all while experiencing a 90% drop in value. Established in 2012 by Lior Div, Yonatan Striem-Amit, and Yossi Naar, Cybereason competes with companies such as Crowdstrike and SentinelOne, offering a variety of services including ransomware protection and prevention of malware attacks. Throughout its 11 years of operation, the company has raised $850 million, with the main investor being SoftBank. A significant achievement for the company was the company's funding round in 2021, in which it raised $325 million, led by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s investment fund Liberty Strategic Capital. Neuberger Berman, Irving and SoftBank also participated in the round. The company was ultimately valued at approximately $3.1 billion and even filed a prospectus for an IPO that year, expecting a valuation of $5 billion. However, the economic turmoil of 2022 caught the company by surprise and changed its trajectory. Amidst a global economic downturn, Cybereason, which at its peak employed about 1,500 workers, was forced to concede that it had over-hired employees. What's more, SoftBank, which was hit hard by its massive investment in WeWork, made it clear to all companies in which they invested that they would need to make immediate and massive cuts. Cybereason has since carried out two large rounds of layoffs, parting ways with a total of more than 300 employees, in addition to further significant cuts. In April of last year, it raised $100 million from SoftBank and Lior Div announced that he was resigning as CEO, and would be replaced by Eric Gan, a SoftBank executive with deep knowledge of the company. Div said that the company had enjoyed an excellent final quarter and that he was resigning because he wanted to focus on a new venture. However, according to a Delaware stock authorization form first noticed by Nasdaq Private Market and reported by Axios, the new Series G shares were sold at a price more than a 90% lower than the round in 2021, meaning the company was being valued at between $300-400 million."

This was one of the two main divisions of Israeli company Orbotech, acquired by KLA in 2019 for $3.4 billion. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Orbotech specializes in developing systems for testing machines used in the production of printed circuits and flat screens, primarily selling to customers in the Far East. In recent years, KLA has experienced a slowdown across all its business sectors, prompting previous rounds of personnel cuts. Orbotech's traditional activities have exhibited notable weakness in recent quarters. The entire division dedicated to test systems for printed circuits and flat panel displays accounted for only about 3% of KLA's revenues, totaling $283 million in 2023, representing a 48% decrease. When combined with revenues from other services provided by Orbotech, annual turnover reached half a billion dollars, but even this figure reflects a sharp decline of 34%. The weakness in this sector mainly reflects a slowdown in investments and demand in the consumer electronics market. KLA stated in response: \\\"KLA announced today a strategic decision to close the equipment division for flat panel display manufacturers due to a continuous decline in this market and the cancellation of a project with a major customer. We are committed to providing continued support to existing customers, as we have already informed them.

The vast majority of the people being laid off are based in Israel, with the company summoning about 40 employees from the Israeli branch to a hearing on Monday. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Melio said that the employees who will be laid off will receive increased compensation packages, professional guidance in the job search process, as well as improved conditions for purchasing options. This is the second round of layoffs the company has implemented, but in the first one in August 2022, the local branch was not affected. Melio employed around 650 people prior to the layoffs, including 400 in Israel. The company, which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in September 2021, explained that the rate of growth in the company has caused inefficiency in organizational structures in some of the departments, with the branch in Israel growing from about 90 employees to over 400 in the last three years. The development department alone grew from about 50 employees to around 300 over that period. Matan Bar, CEO of Melio, said: \\\"This is a difficult day for us. Accelerated growth as we have experienced in recent years is welcome, but it is the management's responsibility to examine all the time whether the organizational structure that has worked so far will serve us well for our goals in the future as well.

Amnon Shashua\u2019s startup is laying off 100 employees, primarily in marketing and sales, four months after cutting 50 jobs  Only three months after firing 50 employees, Amnon Shashua's OrCam is cutting its workforce again. This time, the company will lay off 100 employees, primarily marketing personnel for its reading glasses for the blind in Israel and the USA. This represents about half of the remaining employees after the February layoffs. The company will now focus mainly on sales through distributors and continued development of hearing systems. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 The reason for the cuts, according to estimates, is a sharp decrease in sales to Arab countries, some of which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. A significant portion of the expected revenue for the company, founded and managed by Amnon Shashua of Mobileye fame, comes from these countries. The company concluded that these effects will not subside until the end of 2024, complicating the planned IPO. OrCam stated: \\\"Due to the ongoing process of splitting the hearing and vision divisions, combined with a challenging business climate, the company is required to enhance efficiency processes. Reducing operating costs will help the company focus its activities, accelerate the transition to profitability, and prepare for raising capital when market conditions allow.\\\" While sources close to OrCam said the war also played a role in the drop in sales, the development of generative artificial intelligence technologies that perform functions similar to OrCam's reading device for the blind using smartphones has also contributed to this decision. As a result, the company, now managed by Elad Serfaty, has decided to concentrate on developing hearing aids. OrCam, founded by Shashua and Ziv Aviram, planned to go public during the COVID-19 pandemic after it approached a revenue rate of $100 million and profitability. In March 2021, it raised $50 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, aiming for a valuation above $2.5 billion in the IPO. However, these plans have stalled due to the war and the freeze on purchases from Arab countries, which were a significant growth engine for the Israeli company. At its peak, the company employed about 400 workers. It conducted the first round of layoffs at the end of 2022, laying off several dozen workers. In February 2024, it laid off 50 more workers, leaving 220 employees before the current round of layoffs."

The Tel Aviv District Court appointed the company a trustee to examine proposals for the sale of the company or its assets. The Israeli startup, which raised a $15 million Series A in November 2022, has just seven employees remaining after once employing over 70 people Everybuddy Games has been appointed a trustee by the Tel Aviv District Court after amassing NIS 15 million (approximately $4.1 million) in debt. The Israeli startup is the company behind popular casual mobile game Lucky Buddies. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 It raised $15 million in a Series A funding round in November 2022, led by Makers Fund with participation from Key1 Capital. Everybuddy, which was founded by serial entrepreneurs Yair Panet, Danny Frishman, Boaz Cohen, Eyal Katz, Shay Molho and Adi Dagan, employed 70 people at the time, but currently only has seven employees remaining. Judge Iris Lushi-Abudi determined that a temporary trustee (Attorney Inbar Hakimian-Nahari) should be appointed for the company and authorized her to examine proposals for the sale of the company or its assets and operations. The company petitioned the Tel Aviv court to continue its activities through a temporary trustee to prevent damage to its assets and proposed a financial plan based on collecting expected payments from customers playing its game. The company's flagship product is Lucky Buddies, with revenue being generated from in-game player purchases. The company submitted the request two days ago and also obtained a freezing order on its operations. According to the company, founded in 2013 with offices located in Herzliya, its main product attracts about 25,000-30,000 different players per day, mainly from countries such as the USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada, and more. According to Everybuddy\u2019s court filing, it failed to raise new funding as the outbreak of the war with Hamas last October dealt a further blow to the fundraising market, which had already cooled due to increased interest rates. \\\"As a result, almost all potential investors with whom the company conducted various investment processes announced the freezing of procedures.\\\" The debt breakdown includes approximately NIS 7.5 million ($2.04 million) in debt to suppliers and creditors, NIS 7 million ($1.9 million) owed to Bank Mizrahi, and around NIS 1 million ($270,000) owed to employees."

The renewable energy company, which has seen its valuation fall by 80%, is expecting its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 to be 55% lower than the third quarter, which were themselves 27% less than the second quarter SolarEdge is embarking on an extensive cutback program that includes laying off 900 employees, 550 of which are based in Israel. The company employs about 5,500 people, meaning it will be cutting around 16% of its total workforce. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 This decision comes amid a sharp decline in SolarEdge's revenues. The renewable energy company previously said that it expects its revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 to amount to approximately $325 million\u2014 55% lower than the revenues in the third quarter. The announcement surprised analysts, who were predicting a drop in revenue, but not to such an extent. The revenues presented in the third quarter, $725 million, were also 27% lower than the revenues of the second quarter, which were $991 million. SolarEdge\u2019s fall from grace has been especially painful, with the company being part of the S&P 500 up until two months ago. The company, which produces systems for managing solar installations, attributes the decrease in revenue to the postponement of orders and cancellations from customers and distributors in Europe, along with an increase in inventory. Additionally, SolarEdge faces a difficult macro environment which is challenging for renewable energy companies in general. The high interest rate made financing projects very expensive, and the renewable energy industry is highly sensitive to such an increase in price. This must be added to the increase in the prices of goods and raw materials. All of these factors led to a decrease in demand for installing systems, especially in the private market. A change in tax incentives in the U.S. and Europe also contributed to the damage to demand. The decline in revenues resulted in a sharp drop in the value of SolarEdge. Last Friday, despite the positive trend in the U.S. markets, the energy company's stock fell and reached a four-and-a-half-year low since September 2019. The company's market value is currently estimated at $3.9 billion, a far cry from the record value of $20 billion which it reached in mid-2022, becoming the largest Israeli company on Wall Street. Additionally, last week, the investment bank Barclays lowered the target price of SolarEdge shares to $50, a price 29% lower than the share price at the closing of trading on Friday ($69.1). Nevertheless, investment behemoth BlackRock has decided to increase its stake in SolarEdge over recent months, with a report to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing that it held a 15.8% stake in SolarEdge at the end of 2023, up from 9% in its previous report in April 2023. Zvi Lando, Chief Executive Officer of SolarEdge, said, \u201cWe have made a very difficult, but necessary decision to implement a workforce reduction and other cost-cutting measures in order to align our cost structure with the rapidly changing market dynamics. We are making every effort to treat our departing colleagues with respect and gratitude for their contributions and support them in their transition. We remain confident in the long-term growth of the solar energy market and our leading position in the smart energy space. These changes do not impact our strategic direction and priorities and we remain committed to continue to drive the renewable energy transformation, while providing best in class technology and support to our customers.\u201d"

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Sisense employed as many as 800 people in 2022, but following the latest round of cutbacks will remain with a team of around just 400 employees. The current layoffs are another shock in a long series of developments at Sisense that began with the departure of senior executives in 2022, followed by relatively small-scale layoffs and a halt in recruitment. In 2022, Sisense reduced its workforce from 800 employees to 600 employees, and many of the company's early employees left. Alongside the downsizing, Sisense changed its business focus several times, shifting from developing analytics tools for businesses to focusing solely on large enterprises, and then deciding to concentrate on integrating analytics tools into other corporate software. At the end of April of last year, the company announced the appointment of Ariel Katz as CEO in place of Amir Orad, who shifted to the role of Chairman. Katz had joined a year earlier as Chief Products and Technology Officer and General Manager of Israel. Sisense, which reported reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $150 million last year, is an established company that was founded back in 2004.

Half of those laid off will be from Israel, and the remainder from locations around the world, including London, Portland, Bangkok, and other offices in the U.S. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2024 Orca, which employs around 430 people, said it plans to offer some of the affected employees to remain in the company in alternative positions. Since its establishment, Orca Security has raised $640 million and, in its latest fundraising round in 2021, achieved a valuation of $1.8 billion. Among its investors are the Singaporean Temasek fund, YL Ventures, Alphabet's independent growth fund CapitalG, Redpoint Ventures, GGV, ICONIQ Capital, Lone Pine Capital, Stripes, Adams Street Partners, Willoughby Capital, and Harmony Partners. Last July, Orca, founded by Check Point veterans, filed a lawsuit against Assaf Rappaport's Wiz, which he founded with other Adallom veterans. In the lawsuit filed in the District Court of Delaware in the U.S., Orca argued that it has evidence demonstrating that Wiz built its business through willful infringement of Orca's intellectual property. Orca asserts that it developed and began marketing the product before Wiz, and that Wiz copied its patents. Orca Security was founded in 2019 by Avi Shua, Gil Geron, Matan Ben Gur, Liran Antebi, Hadas Amitay, Wagde Zabit, Shay Filosof, and Eti Spiegel-Khobra, all of whom are former employees of Check Point. Orca stated, \\\"Orca has achieved an all-time high in terms of the number of customers, revenue growth of hundreds of percent since the last capital raising, and high customer satisfaction according to surveys. Alongside these accomplishments, including our designation as a global AWS security partner, we, like other companies, are compelled to enhance efficiency during this period. We are currently undergoing a reorganization process, bidding farewell to exceptional individuals who have played a pivotal role in Orca's success. Depending on the reorganization, some employees may find positions within the company in different capacities. Additionally, Orca continues its expansion and recruitment efforts for growing departments within the company.\\\""

All 70 employees of the Israeli startup, which was purchased for around $20 million last May, were notified they are being laid off  A little over a year after being acquired by San Francisco-based Vianai Systems, Israeli startup Dealtale is being shut down. The company\u2019s employees were invited to an urgent all-hands meeting on Tuesday in which they were notified that all 70 employees are being laid off, including over 30 based in Israel. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Dealtale was purchased last May, just two years after it was founded, for a sum of a little over $20 million in cash. The company, which had previously raised just $1.7 million, developed a platform to analyze and optimize customer journeys to enhance the capabilities of sales, marketing, and product professionals. Dealtale was founded by CEO Ariel Geifman, VP R&D Aviran Moshe, CTO Adi Mizrahi, and CFO and COO Nir Goldberg. At the time of the acquisition, Vianai said it intends to expand its local R&D center and hire dozens of additional employees. Vianai, which has raised $190 million to date, was founded by Vishal Sikka, the former CEO of Infosys and CTO of SAP. The company shifted its business focus over recent months, putting its chips on generative AI. In April, it launched hila, an AI-powered chat assistant for institutional and retail investors, investment banking analysts, and other investment professionals. This also meant that the products Dealtale was working on became more expendable for the company, so much so that Vianai ceased its operations completely."

The Israeli startup is parting ways with around 150 employees. \u201cThe only way to give the company a fighting chance of survival and getting back to a path of sustainable growth is to keep on a small core of people that represent bare operational necessity,\u201d wrote CEO Yaniv Bertele Under fire Vesttoo is laying off around 150 employees, accounting for 75% of the company\u2019s workforce. Most of the company\u2019s employees are headquartered in Israel. Check out all Vesttoo related articles Calcalist uncovered last month that the allegedly fake letters of credit (LOCs) provided by investors to insurers for reinsurance transactions on the Vesttoo platform are believed to total a sum of around $4 billion. The fraud came to light when one of the LOCs was found to be fake, leading to a comprehensive review of all letters of credit issued by the company. The Israeli startup released a statement last week admitting that \u201cat a minimum, it appears that Vesttoo\u2019s procedures were circumvented.\u201d \u201cI am writing to you today with great sorrow, to inform you that we have reached the incredibly difficult decision to part ways with many of our people, across all teams and geographies at Vesttoo, and I would like to share the considerations that led to this very painful choice,\u201d CEO Yaniv Bertele wrote in an email to employees. \u201cOver the last two weeks we have looked at many different options with a primary purpose in mind: ensuring that Vesttoo weathers this storm in a way that makes rebuilding possible. In spite of this serious crisis, we have never lost faith in the sound foundations of our approach to revolutionizing the reinsurance industry by better connecting the insurance and capital markets by combining AI-powered technology and expertise in data science, insurance risk transfer and finance. \u201cAs we considered our options, we had to recognize two important facts: 1. We do not know how long this process will take, and 2. The amount of runway we have. These two factors led to the unavoidable conclusion that the only way to give the company a fighting chance of survival and getting back to a path of sustainable growth is to keep on a small core of people that represent bare operational necessity. These changes are meant to preserve, and focus on Vesttoo\u2019s core services, our data-driven solution and marketplace, and providing solutions for our affected clients. \u201cWith regards to the investigation, the company is doing all it can to determine how and where the fraudulent LOCs originated. At a minimum, it appears that Vesttoo\u2019s procedures were circumvented by external parties but we are committed to understanding the full picture of what happened. This is why we have engaged an experienced investigations team and external attorneys to advise us throughout this process.\u201d Clear Blue Insurance Group was among the companies which released statements last week aimed at reassuring their clients in the wake of the Vesttoo scandal. Clear Blue and Vesttoo announced a partnership in August 2022 through which the Israeli startup was set to deploy as much as $1 billion from the capital markets through Clear Blue\u2019s property and casualty programs. Clear Blue confirmed that it is aware of the allegations and that the \u201cletters of credit issued by the China Construction Bank for reinsurance collateral, on behalf of Vesttoo, are fraudulent.\u201d It said it has been using Vesttoo for reinsurance since early 2022."

The Covid-19 pandemic propelled AudioCodes, which specializes in communication solutions for digital work environments, to a record valuation of over $1.3 billion in 2020. The founder had plans for an exit, but that led to a conflict with an old friend, and as the epidemic waned, demand weakened, and the company's stock plummeted The troubles at Audiocodes are taking a toll on its shareholders. In May, the company, which provides communication solutions for digital work environments, lowered its revenue forecast for the current year. During an analyst call held after the publication of the first-quarter 2023 results, the CEO and largest shareholder, Shabtai Adlersberg (14.1%), stated that Audiocodes' revenues for 2023 would range between $240 million and $250 million. This represents a 16% decrease compared to the previous forecast and a 12% decrease compared to the 2022 revenues. The downward revision in forecast followed the company's announcement in April that it expected a decrease in net profit in the first quarter of the year. The quarterly report also presented lukewarm results for Audiocodes. Revenues amounted to $59.2 million, a 10.8% decrease compared to the $66.4 million generated in the first quarter of 2022. This decline in revenues resulted in a transition from a net profit of $8.6 million to a loss of $200,000. Against the backdrop of deteriorating results, the company's stock, traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, has recorded a 40% decrease since the beginning of the year and a 65% decrease since the start of 2020, making it the second-worst performing stock on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange during this period. Presently, Audiocodes trades at a market value of NIS 1.2 billion ($330 million), which is 75% lower than its record value of NIS 4.8 billion ($1.3 billion) in July 2020. Audiocodes was founded in 1993 by Adlersberg and Leon Bialik after the two left DSP. The company develops and markets voice function solutions that facilitate collaboration between different applications such as Zoom and Teams. Microsoft is a prominent partner of Audiocodes. In recent years, the company has also ventured into developing artificial intelligence products for voice recognition in internet chats, as well as products for recording, transcribing, and analyzing meetings within and outside organizations. Due to its focus on remote work solutions, Audiocodes experienced a surge in its stock value during the pandemic. The widespread belief that remote work would become a fundamental aspect of work, in general, led to a significant increase in demand for the company's products. However, recent months have seen Audiocodes grappling with a decline in product demand. This decrease can be attributed to several factors, including the gradual return of employees to physical offices, reduced reliance on remote work, and increased competition, particularly from cloud-based solutions that reduce companies' dependence on Audiocodes' products. The management of Audiocodes attributes the decrease in product demand in Europe and the U.S. to economic uncertainty caused by rising interest rates aimed at combating high inflation levels worldwide. In light of these circumstances, the company announced plans to lay off 8-10% of its employees this year, resulting in 80 immediate job terminations, equivalent to 6% of its workforce. Additionally, Audiocodes is relocating its management headquarters from Airport City to Or Yehuda to reduce rental costs. In 2020, during a period when Audiocodes traded at its peak value, several attempts were made to find a buyer for the company, with potential acquirers aiming to gain controlling ownership and potentially delist the company from public trading. Audiocodes lacks a controlling nucleus, despite Adlersberg being the largest shareholder. Various local and international parties approached investment funds to present acquisition offers and acquire a controlling interest in Audiocodes. Adlersberg himself also sought assistance from an international investment bank to explore options for bringing in a large entity as the controlling owner of Audiocodes. However, none of these attempts materialized into a deal. These efforts led to a conflict between Adlersberg and Avi Alkalay, owner of the Hadas Institute. Alkalay attempted to interest one of the world's largest investment funds, Permira, which previously acquired Israeli company Netafim, in acquiring controlling ownership of Audiocodes. Alkalay reached out to the director of Permira's operations in Israel, Ran Maidan, former CEO of Netafim. Although the appeal did not result in a deal, Alkalay demanded a fee of half a million dollars from Audiocodes and Adlersberg. According to Alkalay's letter, he made multiple unsuccessful attempts to find a buyer for the company due to a lack of cooperation from the CEO and his old friend, Adlersberg. Consequently, Alkalay demanded compensation of half a million dollars for his efforts. Audiocodes considers Alkalay's demand an extortion attempt, as he allegedly threatened to reveal personal details about Adlersberg's life and his relationship with a top executive at the company. Alkalay claimed that the executive's salary significantly increased over the years due to her relationship with Adlersberg and threatened to expose this information, among other things. An insider close to Adlersberg stated: \\\"He heard personal details about Adlersberg's life while spending time together with their families, and he is trying to exploit that. He is under financial pressure and trying to extract whatever he can from Adlersberg.\\\" Alkalay denies facing any financial difficulties and added that Adlersberg himself approached him twice to find a buyer for controlling ownership of the company but avoided entering into negotiations when potential buyers were found. The current decline in Audiocodes' stock prompted the company to approve an undisclosed share buyback plan this year to support the stock price. The repurchases are expected to amount to tens of millions of dollars. This is a reverse strategy from June 2020, when the stock was at its peak, and Audiocodes conducted a secondary offering on the Nasdaq, selling shares at $35 per share. Presently, the stock price stands at only $8, allowing Audiocodes to repurchase shares at a lower price than they were initially issued. While this move may provide some consolation for investors selling their shares, it comes after a three-year period during which the company lost 75% of its value compared to its peak and erased billions of shekels from its market capitalization."

The current layoffs are another shock in a long series of negative developments at Sisense, beginning with the departure of senior executives last year and followed by relatively small-scale layoffs and a halt in recruitment Less than three months after announcing the retirement of Amir Orad from the position of CEO, software company Sisense is embarking on an extensive round of layoffs. Calcalist has learned that Sisense is set to part ways with 100 employees, which make up about 15% of the workforce. The move will affect all departments, including the Israeli headquarters, which employs 150 people and where hearings began last week. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 The current layoffs are another shock in a long series of developments at Sisense that began with the departure of senior executives last year, followed by relatively small-scale layoffs and a halt in recruitment. In 2022, Sisense reduced its workforce from 800 employees to 600 employees, and many of the company's early employees left. Alongside the downsizing, Sisense changed its business focus several times, shifting from developing analytics tools for businesses to focusing solely on large enterprises, and then deciding to concentrate on integrating analytics tools into other corporate software. At the end of April, the company announced the appointment of Ariel Katz as CEO. Katz had joined a year earlier as Chief Products and Technology Officer and General Manager of Israel. Sisense is an established company that was founded back in 2004. Eight years ago, Orad, who was not part of the founding team, joined to manage the company, and in 2019, he helped make the company one of the first to reach a valuation of a billion dollars with a $100 million funding round led by Insight Partners. The main investors in Sisense, apart from Insight, are renowned venture capital funds such as Bessemer Ventures Partners, Battery Ventures, and Access. Shortly after the recruitment, Sisense began preparing for an IPO on Wall Street, but this plan never came to fruition due to the company's inability to stabilize revenues. Since the 2019 round, Sisense has not completed any additional capital raises and has instead financed itself through credit. Sisense reported reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $150 million earlier this year and positive EBITDA over the previous two quarters. The company even achieved positive cash flow, which allows it to refrain from raising money at this stage. However, despite the seemingly high revenue rate, Sisense didn\u2019t register the same rate of growth compared to the previous year, which is one of the reasons for the current layoffs. The new CEO is planning another change in the company's business direction that will involve marketing to developers who will integrate its business intelligence tools at the code stage as an integral part of the software. \\\"Like any responsible company during this period, and in order to maintain the growth and level of profitability that we have sustained for a significant period of time, we realized that efficiency measures are necessary within the company. We are committed to helping the employees who are leaving find their next workplace, and providing them with all the support they need during this challenging period,\\\" Katz said in response to Calcalist's inquiry. \\\"As a leading company in the world of embedded analytics, we continue to work on new growth engines and leverage products to strengthen our leadership for years to come, and build an organization that aligns with our goals, which include both growth and profitability.\\\""

        "Extracted Article": "Healthtech startup DayTwo facing uncertain future after dramatic restructuring. The Israeli startup, which raised $85 million mainly from co-founder Marius Nacht, has reduced its staff by over 75% over the past year and is hoping to sell its technology to another company After much buzz and hype, Israeli nutrition company DayTwo is nearing the end of its journey. The company, co-founded and primarily funded by Marius Nacht, is reducing most of its operations and retaining only a small core team for development and customer service in Israel and the U.S., according to Calcalist's sources. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 The aim is to provide support to existing customers and potentially sell its technology to an external party. The company employed 150 staff in 2022, but currently only has 35 employees remaining, with 20 in Israel and 15 in the U.S. DayTwo raised $85 million to develop and market kits that personalized proper nutrition for diabetic patients based on their stool samples. The company's unique approach meant it would sometimes recommend foods like pizza, hamburgers with fries, or bread with butter, which it believed could be healthier for certain individuals. Through genetic analysis and sugar tests, the system provided personalized adjustments to food choices. While DayTwo demonstrated positive results in improving sugar levels, weight loss outcomes were inconclusive. Criticism also arose over the recommendation of foods that, despite their sugar-lowering benefits, were deemed unhealthy. Despite initial enthusiasm and marketing through Israeli HMOs Maccabi and Clalit, who charged a one-time payment for the kits, the company's business model failed to generate profitability. Two years ago, CEO Lihi Segal, one of the founders, departed, and Dave Henderson, an American CEO, took over. The plan was to enter the U.S. market and adopt a subscription model with organizations and insurance companies, some of which signed agreements with the company. However, the emergence of diabetes injections like Ozempic, which offer both sugar level management and weight loss benefits, undermined DayTwo's target population. Starting in 2023, cooperation between DayTwo and Maccabi and Clalit came to an end and it is no longer possible to order new kits. Only support for existing customers is provided. Calcalist also discovered that the company recently sold its laboratory and shifted operations to the U.S. through distributors. At the end of 2022, a significant downsizing took place, resulting in the dismissal of dozens of employees in both Israel and the U.S. DayTwo conducted further layoffs in recent weeks, including senior personnel. Established in 2015, DayTwo was among the first and most prominent investments of Marius Nacht, one of Check Point's three founders, upon his transition into the medical field. The founding team also included CEO Lihi Segal (until 2021) and Yuval Ofek, who served as chairman. The current chairman is Yair Briman. Notable investors in the company include Nacht and Yair Schindel's aMoon fund, 10D, Cathay Innovation Ventures, Poalim Capital Markets, La\u2019maison Fund, and Micron Ventures. In 2018, basketball player Omri Casspi also made an undisclosed investment after using DayTwo's kit and becoming its presenter in the Israeli market. The company stated: \\\"Like any startup, we constantly adjust our business model and personnel structure accordingly. For instance, our main solution in the U.S. is transitioning to a digital-based approach without dietitians, and we have introduced a new sales channel through distributors. R&D remains in Israel and continues to lead product development and research.\\\""

The Israeli-founded company went public in October through a SPAC merger at a valuation of $1.2 billion, but currently has a market cap of around just $120 million Hospitality company Selina is facing significant challenges regarding its future. Just eight months after its IPO, Selina finds itself in a position of laying off employees, halting expansion plans, and urgently seeking additional funding. As of the end of March, the company's cash balance was a mere $23 million. Today, Selina announced substantial cost-cutting measures, including the termination of approximately 350 employees, the closure of several properties, and a near-complete suspension of new hotel openings. These actions are aimed at mitigating the cash drain, which led to a substantial loss of $200 million despite generating $183 million in revenue in 2022. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Selina, founded in 2015 by Rafael Museri and Daniel Rudasevski, went public in October through a SPAC merger at a valuation of $1.2 billion, raising $54 million. However, the company's market cap currently hovers around just $120 million. CEO Rafael Museri spoke with Calcalist and acknowledged the need for a change in Selina's organizational culture, stating, \\\"The market has shifted its focus from valuing growth to prioritizing profitability. Consequently, Selina's approach needs to adapt.\\\" Museri further explained that instead of pursuing frequent deals and opening numerous hotels, Selina will no longer open new properties and will even close unprofitable ones. After the current round of layoffs, Selina will retain approximately 2,000 employees, consolidating its headquarters from eight different offices into one, with some employees working remotely. This cost-cutting plan is projected to result in $5.8 million in savings starting from the second quarter of 2023, alongside a one-time expenditure of $1 million for severance payments. In the first quarter of 2023, Selina reported revenues of $54.2 million, representing a 32% increase compared to the same quarter last year and a slight increase compared to the previous quarter. Excluding the new hotels, revenues increased by 18%. The occupancy rate rose to 57% compared to 45% in the corresponding period last year. However, the company still incurred a total loss of $30.3 million, although it improved from $38.3 million in the previous year's quarter. The company's free cash flow before debt service was $12.6 million, down from $14.3 million in Q1 of 2022. During the first quarter, Selina did not open any new hotels and concluded the period with 118 properties and 29,600 beds. The company has begun the process of exiting from underperforming properties and has already closed five sites in Mexico, the USA, Greece, Austria, and Costa Rica. Selina intends to release an updated forecast for 2023 with a lower growth rate than the previously projected 30-40%. Simultaneously, Selina announced a funding agreement with Global University Systems (GUS), a remote learning platform operator, to raise a total of $50 million. In the initial stage, Selina will receive $10 million from GUS, which will become a strategic investor in Selina and be granted two seats on the board of directors. It remains unclear which of the existing eight directors will step down to accommodate the new members. If Selina successfully secures an additional $20 million from other investors, GUS will provide an additional $20 million. The fundraising will involve privately issued shares at a 10% discount on the market price and convertible bonds. Selina is currently in negotiations with other investors, including existing ones, to raise $20 million. Furthermore, Selina drew $10 million from a credit line of $50 million in late May and restructured the repayment of a loan it acquired for expansion in South America when it was still a private company. As part of the restructuring, the debt was converted into Selina shares."

        "Extracted Article": "Payoneer to part with 200 employees, 10% of workforce. The fintech company, which is traded on Nasdaq with a market cap of around $1.7 billion, is mainly laying off employees from the marketing and service departments Four months after appointing a new CEO, Israeli fintech company Payoneer is embarking on a significant round of layoffs. The company, which is traded on Nasdaq with a market cap of around $1.7 billion, will part ways with 200 employees, which make up about 10% of its workforce. At this stage, the final number of those laid off in Israel is not known. About half of Payoneer\u2019s approximately 2,000 employees are based in Israel, where most of its R&D takes place. The cutbacks are set to get underway this week. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Payoneer, established in 2005, was over the years one of the most promising unicorns in Israel. The company operates in the payments and clearing market for small and medium-sized businesses, estimated by the company at $5 trillion. Payoneer's business model is based on collecting a commission from the payments made on its platform, which operates in 190 countries. Recently, it also launched a dedicated solution in partnership with the credit card giant Mastercard. Payoneer went public through a merger with a SPAC on Nasdaq at a value of $3.3 billion in June 2021. The company raised over a billion dollars in the process, some of which went to the company's coffers and some to the founders and longtime shareholders, including former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who invested in the company early on. The layoffs at Payoneer come both against the backdrop of the macroeconomic situation and due to the management's desire to move towards profitable growth. For example, in the first quarter of 2023, the volume of payments between businesses made on Payoneer's platform was lower than expected. Most of the layoffs are expected to focus on the marketing and service departments, while the impact on the development sector will be low, which also means that the number of employees laid off in Israel is expected to be relatively small. Payoneer announced in March that after nine months as co-CEO alongside veteran CEO Scott Galit, John Caplan will become the company\u2019s full-time CEO. Galit, who served in senior positions at Payoneer for 12 years and led its IPO, remained on the board of directors. At the same time, a new CFO (Bea Ordonez) was also appointed. The new management announced a new strategy which would focus on large and profitable customers and building a new generation of its payments platform. Upon taking office, the new CEO noted that a quarter of Payoneer's customers generate the most revenues and activity, so from now on, marketing and services will be focused on these half a million customers. The company then revealed in its financial reports for the first quarter that it stopped hiring as of May 1, which should save it $5 million by the end of 2023. Ordonez also added that the company is actively examining its cost structure to reduce unnecessary positions in the organization without harming development. Payoneer is expected to finish 2023 with a growth rate of about 30%, bringing it to revenues of $810-820 million. After recording a bottom line loss in 2022, Payoneer started the first quarter on the right foot with a net profit of $8 million, part of which was due to interest income on a cash fund of half a billion dollars. Payoneer stated in response: \\\"Like any responsible company, Payoneer examines measures to make the organization more accurate. In addition, we are recruiting dozens of developers and product managers in Israel to build our financial cloud.\\\" Source close to Payoneer also added that the plan to recruit 150 employees for the development center in Israel, which the company announced in March, is still in effect."

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Outbrain raised $160 million at a $1.12 billion valuation in its IPO two years ago, but currently has a market cap of just $236 million. The company laid off 38 employees last July after raising $200 million in funding from Boston-based investment manager The Baupost Group. Outbrain registered revenue of $231.8 million in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of $22.4 million, or 9%, compared to $254.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower revenue of approximately $51.6 million due to net revenue retention of 80% on existing media partners. The company explained that lower yields were mainly the result of weaker demand on the platform, primarily as a result of the current macroeconomic conditions and the impact on advertising spend, as well as due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. In all, the company recorded a net loss of $5.6 million, compared to net loss of $1.9 million in the prior year period. \\\"Today we shared some difficult news with the company's employees, when we decided to say goodbye to about 10% of Outbrain's global workforce,\u201d Outbrain said in a statement. \u201cThe past year has brought with it rapid changes in the industry and sector, including reductions in personnel.

The company\u2019s first FDA approval was for use in single-site, natural orifice laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal benign surgical procedures including benign hysterectomies. \\\"The company made progress in launching its gynecological product in accordance with the plans and proved its clinical and economic value, which can be seen in the fact that leading hospitals in the U.S. are repeat customers of the company,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cThe system has been getting better and better thanks to feedback from the field following close work with the customers and leading doctors. As a result, the performance specifications of the system, planned for reaching the market in 2025, have already been achieved, thus creating an opportunity for us to reach the main market of general surgery about two years before the planned time. Therefore, the company decided to focus on bringing to market a platform that serves a wide patient audience, both in gynecology and general surgery, and in order to promote market entry, we are currently focusing on regulatory efforts to obtain FDA approval for a product for general surgery in the coming year. \u201cDue to the need to focus on the regulatory efforts, we have made the necessary business decision, with the broad support of the board of directors and all shareholders, to suspend production, marketing and sales efforts in the coming year. Therefore with great regret we say goodbye to approximately 70 out of the company's 120 employees, with the aim of slowing down the cash burn rate and to reach the market under optimal conditions at the beginning of 2024. This is a difficult day for me and it pains me to say goodbye to wonderful and dedicated employees who have come a long, long way with me.\\\""

It was reported last week that the Israeli firm's hacking tools have been used against journalists, opposition figures and advocacy organizations across at least 10 countries Israeli offensive cyber company QuaDream is shutting down, Calcalist has learned. According to sources, all of the company\u2019s employees were notified they are set to be laid off and called in for a hearing. The company is set to cease its operations in the coming days. The company could not be reached for comment. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Last week, it was reported that the Israeli firm's hacking tools have been used against journalists, opposition figures and advocacy organizations across at least 10 countries - including people in North America and Europe - according to new research published by Microsoft and the internet watchdog Citizen Lab. According to sources, the company has been in a difficult situation for several months, and the research was the last nail in its coffin. The company hasn't been fully active for a while and it is believed that there are only two employees left in its offices whose job it is to look after the computers and other equipment. At the same time, the board of directors is trying to sell the company's intellectual property. Citizen Lab said in its report that it had been able to identify a handful of civil society victims whose iPhones had been hacked using surveillance software developed by QuaDream - a lower-profile competitor to the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which has been blacklisted by the U.S. government over allegations of abuse. In its report published at the same time, Microsoft said it believed with \\\"high confidence\\\" that the spyware was \\\"strongly linked to QuaDream.\\\" In a statement, Microsoft Associate General Counsel Amy Hogan-Burney said that mercenary hacking groups like QuaDream \\\"thrive in the shadows\\\" and that publicly outing them was \\\"essential to stopping this activity.\\\" Israeli lawyer Vibeke Dank, whose email was listed on QuaDream's corporate registration form, did not return a message seeking comment. Repeated attempts by Reuters to reach QuaDream over the past year - including a visit to the company\u2019s office outside Tel Aviv - have been unsuccessful. Reuters reported in 2022 that QuaDream had previously developed a no-interaction-needed hacking tool similar to the programs deployed by NSO. Such hacking tools, known as \\\"zero-click,\\\" are particularly prized by cybercriminals, spies, and law enforcement because they can remotely compromise devices without an owner needing to open a malicious link or download a tainted attachment. NSO did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Neither Citizen Lab nor Microsoft identified the targets of QuaDream's software, but the allegation could still be damaging for the firm. The reports come on the heels of an announced crackdown on the international spyware industry by U.S. President Joe Biden. Last month, the White House announced an executive order intended to curb the purchase of surveillance software by U.S. agencies if the programs are also being used by repressive governments abroad. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Unlike NSO, which regularly briefed journalists amid allegations of abuse, QuaDream has kept a lower profile. The company has no website touting its business and employees have been told to keep any reference to their employer off social media, Reuters has previously reported. Reuters contributed to this report"

Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 The company wrote on Wednesday to around 370 employees, who are mostly headquartered in the U.S. and work for the customer care department, to inform them of the termination of their employment. The layoffs focused on customer service sites in Austin, Miami, Denver and San Francisco - some of which will be closed entirely. The layoffs are not surprising in view of Wix's operational difficulties on the one hand and the shake-up created by activist fund Starboard. Wix enjoyed a strong windfall during the Corona period, with its number of employees swelling greatly and reaching 6,000. That figure already fell to 5,700 people at the end of the third quarter, with some being laid off as part of a $150 million cost-cutting plan, and others leaving voluntarily."

The company laid off 15 employees three months ago, but ultimately decided it required far more significant cutbacks Conversation analytics company Gong is laying off 80 employees, accounting for 7% of its workforce. Only five of the employees leaving the company in this round of layoffs are based in Israel. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022-23 Amit Bendov, CEO of Gong, told Calcalist that he estimates that the company will not need to lay off any more employees this year. \u201cThe company is growing, but less than we forecast last year. The macroeconomic conditions are still difficult and we are adapting ourselves to our expected income,\u201d said Bendov. \u201cThe employees being laid off are mainly part of our support and administration teams and aren\u2019t part of the company\u2019s core R&D. \u201cI estimate that we will not lay off any more employees this year, even though there is currently a lack of clarity.

I\u2019ve made the difficult decision to reduce our team by 80 positions (approximately 7% of our total workforce) across Customer Success, Sales, and General & Administrative functions. \u201cI know this decision hurts. It\u2019s the hardest decision I\u2019ve had to make at Gong. The Gongsters we\u2019re saying goodbye to are not just colleagues, they are friends. We are helping those impacted by providing comprehensive severance packages and resources to help them during the transition. \u201cI\u2019m sure your first question is why? The short answer is that while we expect to grow this year and we continue to see healthy new customer adds, our growth will be at a lower rate than we have planned for and have hired for in recent years. We need to adjust the size of our team to reflect our actual anticipated growth. This is a difficult decision and we did not rush into it. We took a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach for the possibility that we might not need to. It is hard to predict the market in the upcoming year, but our planning assumption is that the macro environment will continue to impact our customers, partners, and us.

The company raised a total of $5 million, including from FINTOP Capital and VentureIsrael. Arieli told Calcalist that the company peaked at 20 employees, but he was forced to conduct layoffs as time passed by and funding dried up. \u201cWe embarked on a funding round in May with the aim of raising $15 million, but I very quickly understood that it wasn\u2019t possible and tried again for a significantly lower sum.

However, they do not want to share their failures with others, fearing that they will reflect poorly on them or tarnish their reputation. This is a common mindset, but it is also one that is misguided. Failure is a part of the entrepreneurial journey, and it is something that we must embrace as we move forward. \u201cBeing an entrepreneur is one of the hardest and most consuming jobs in the world. It requires us to face the unknown every minute of our lives and to strive for success constantly. This pursuit of success, however, can often come at a cost, both emotionally and mentally. It's important for other founders to see that they're not alone in their struggles and that even the most promising startups can face challenges and also close operations. \u201cTo all of you who are struggling right now, remember that It is okay to fail the emotional burden that comes with it is something that we must all face at some point in our careers. The shame that we often feel when things do not work out as planned is misplaced, and we must recognize that it is simply a part of the process. By sharing our experiences, we can create a supportive and understanding community where we can learn from each other and grow together.\u201d"

However, beginning on July 20, when it became apparent that there are fewer than one million Pagaya shares publicly available, the company began suffering from what is known as the \u201cGameStop Syndrome\u201d, with a herd of speculators identifying the opportunity to dramatically affect the stock price due to its low liquidity. The company peaked at a valuation of around $20 billion, becoming Israel\u2019s highest-valued company for a short time, only to suffer a painful fall back down to Earth. Pagaya lost over 95% of its value since peaking at the beginning of August, and currently has a market cap of around $640 million."

There is fear that the recession will continue and deepen, interest rates will rise and could lead the stock market to further drops. The Fed is planning an extended exit from the recession and there will be increased uncertainty. The expectation from companies during this period is to show significant improvements on the bottom line and in the short term. Considering this, and while assessing our plans for 2023, we decided that we need to make tough decisions in order to adapt ourselves to expectations and in order to exit this financial storm in a stronger and more flexible position for future growth.\\\""

The company, which built a marketplace for the trading of information coming from connected vehicles, will be embarking on its second round of layoffs that is set to include around 80 employees after parting with dozens of staff members in August. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022 A majority of the company\u2019s remaining 100 employees in Israel are set to be laid off, including the entire team that arrived from Neura, which was acquired last August for $50 million, as well as many staff members from the sales, marketing, and product teams. \u201cWe\u2019re making the hardest changes we have had to make in Otonomo\u2019s history,\u201d CEO Ben Volkow wrote in an email to employees sent out early Thursday. \u201cWe are significantly reducing the size of our team and regretfully saying goodbye to many talented teammates.\u201d Volkow added that anyone impacted \u201cwill receive an email request soon to attend a personal meeting\u201d with their manager and that the employees in Israel, the U.S., and Europe will be informed throughout the day. Otonomo was established in 2015 by Volkow and Avner Cohen, who is not active in the company. The company developed a trading arena for information collected from connected vehicles and serves car manufacturers, vehicle fleets, and service providers in various industries such as insurance and public transportation. According to the company's data, its platform securely processes more than 4 billion items of information every day, which are collected from more than 40 million connected vehicles (those with SIM cards) around the world. In its SPAC merger completed in the summer of 2021, the company raised $255 million. At the same time, Otonomo shareholders also sold $30 million worth of shares based on impressive excel sheets according to which the company was supposed to reach annual revenues of $24 million in 2022 and a gross profit of $4 million, figures it is nowhere near to achieving. The company recorded revenues of only $2 million in the third quarter of the year, mostly coming from Floow, which it acquired in February of this year."

CyCognito, founded in 2017 by former Israeli intelligence unit soldiers Rob Gurzeev and Potekhin, raised a $100 million Series C funding round at an $800 million valuation last December. The round was led by The Westly Group and included Thomvest Ventures, The Heritage Group, Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sorenson Ventures, and UpWest. That new financing round brought the company\u2019s total amount raised to $153 million, all raised in just the three-and-a-half years since the company was founded. The CyCognito platform autonomously builds a graph data model that portrays an organization\u2019s business structure\u2014from the company\u2019s name to the hundreds of departments, subsidiaries, acquisitions, and brands an organization owns. The platform then scans billions of servers and devices across the internet to contextualize and identify internet-exposed and unmanaged assets that could serve as entry points for attackers."

Most of the employees leaving the company are based abroad, with 50 being headquartered in Israel. Cybereason confirmed that it has embarked on a second round of layoffs but didn't specify how many employees would be leaving the company. Full list of Israeli high-tech layoffs in 2022 This is the second round of layoffs at Cybereason, which sacked around 100 employees in June. Cybereason is active in over 50 countries across the world, employing a total of 1,500 people prior to the crisis. Last week it was reported that Cybereason is looking for a buyer, but it is believed that is not the case and the company even turned down a significant acquisition offer this past summer. \u201cThis is a difficult decision for us and we are doing the utmost in order to help the employees in this process,\u201d Cybereason said in a statement. \u201cAs market conditions have changed significantly and the technology IPO market is effectively closed, companies like ourselves must be financially strict and prioritize financial efficiency over growth. The demand for our technology remains high and we are continuing to build an independent global company with long-term strategic goals.\u201d Earlier this year, Cybereason confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering that could have valued it at more than $5 billion. Cybereason is backed by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud unit, as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's investment firm Liberty Strategic Capital. Cybereason, which was founded in 2012 by three Israeli partners, Lior Div, Yonatan Striem-Amit, and Yossi Naar, was valued at roughly $3 billion when it raised $275 million from investors last year. It has raised nearly $750 million from investors to date. Cybereason, which competes with other cybersecurity players like CrowdStrike and SentinelOne, builds artificially intelligent software and offers a variety of services including ransomware protection and prevention of malware attacks. Cybereason's software is installed across computers, mobile phones, and other tech systems. The company also created a subsidiary focusing on preventing malicious operations targeting U.S. government agencies."

However, it is a necessary step to strengthen our business fundamentals so that we can execute on our mission to help small business owners with their financial needs. \u201cHere is some context around the decision. Fundbox serves small businesses through working capital and cash flow solutions, both directly and through our partners. As macroeconomic trends continue to impact the small business economy, we too face material business headwinds. It is clear that these economic challenges will last for longer than we initially expected,\u201d Fuloria added. \u201cMoreover, our business grew quickly over the last two years, and we scaled our team accordingly. We brought on colleagues who have contributed enormously to our progress. But the truth is that we grew our team too fast, and we need to course correct. While we are well capitalized with over $100M in liquidity, we also need to be careful stewards of investor capital. Bringing our workforce back to our pre-pandemic size will strengthen our financial footing as we work towards becoming a profitable business, which we are not today.\u201d"

Firebolt, which has raised $269 million to date, employs over 200 people in more than 20 countries. \u201cThe global economic situation requires us to react to the new market conditions,\u201d Firebolt CEO Eldad Farkash told Calcalist. \u201cEven though we are in an excellent position with over $200 million in our account, we are also affected by the slowdown in the market and have therefore decided to cut back certain parts of the company. We plan to continue and invest significantly in product, engineering, and field teams in order to continue to support and build the cloud data warehouse developers love.\u201d Firebolt was founded in 2018 by Eldad Farkash (CEO) and Saar Bitner (COO), who also worked together at business intelligence unicorn Sisense, of which Farkash was one of the co-founders. Firebolt raised a $37 million Series A in December 2020, and a $127 million Series B in June of last year. Alkeon Capital led its Series C earlier this year, with other participants in the round including Sozo Ventures, Glynn Capital, and existing investors Zeev Ventures, Angular Ventures, Dawn Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, K5 Global and TLV Partners. Firebolt\u2019s data warehousing solution tackles the biggest challenges of the global cloud analytics market by developing a cloud data warehouse that delivers sub-second analytic experiences at scale. Firebolt\u2019s technology allows companies to analyze much larger volumes of data than previously possible."

        "Extracted Article": "Otonomo to lay off dozens of employees after losing over 90% of value. Just a year after it went public via a SPAC merger at a value of $1.26 billion, Israeli autotech company Otonomo has seen its market cap plummet to a mere $62 million Israeli autotech company Otonomo is expected to lay off dozens of employees, Calcalist has learned. The company, which built a marketplace for the trading of information coming from connected vehicles and went public a year ago on Nasdaq, employs close to 200 people - more than half of them at its R&D center in Herzliya. Otonomo, which was issued during the wave of IPOs of companies in the autonomous vehicle sector alongside REE and Innoviz, is on its way to the title of \\\"the worst Israeli IPO of 2021\\\", after its stock plunged from a value of $1.26 billion in the IPO to only $62 million last Friday. The company even announced on the same day that it received a non-compliance letter from Nasdaq regarding the possible delisting of its shares, after its stock traded below the price of a dollar for more than 30 days. Regarding the expected extensive cutbacks, Otonomo told Calcalist that the company does not respond to rumors. Although Otonomo's stock is not the only one that was almost completely erased this year and is under the threat of being delisted, in its case the business results are also noticeably negative. Otonomo is very far from the forecasts it gave at the time of the merger with the SPAC company, both regarding revenues and profitability. Moreover, with the publication of the financial reports for the second quarter about a week ago, it even informed investors that the forecast for 2022 given in the past is not valid, and also that it will not provide a forecast for the second half of the year at all. \u201cAs we look to the second half of the year, we realize we can be susceptible to macro-economic headwinds, which can affect our 2022 guidance. Based on the global uncertainties in the market, the forecast for 2022 should no longer be relied upon and we are not forecasting results for the second half of the year at this time,\u201d Otonomo CEO Ben Volkow stated last week. \u201cWe believe these are near-term challenges and we will remain focused on scaling our business and growing our customer base,\u201d Volkow concluded and provided another justification for the planned layoffs and the fact that his company is trading well below the value of the cash in its coffers. Otonomo was established in 2015 by Volkow and Avner Cohen, who is not active in the company. The company developed a trading arena for information collected from connected vehicles and serves car manufacturers, vehicle fleets and more than 100 service providers in various industries such as insurance and public transportation. According to the company's data, its platform securely processes more than 4 billion items of information every day, which are collected from more than 40 million connected vehicles (those with a SIM card) around the world. In its SPAC merger a year ago, the company raised $255 million, of which only $169 million still remain in its account. At the same time, Otonomo shareholders also sold $30 million worth of shares based on impressive excel sheets according to which the company was supposed to reach annual revenues of $24 million in 2022 and a gross profit of $4 million. Next year, Otonomo was already supposed to register revenues of $98 million and be operationally balanced, but even Volkow himself admitted in the conference call with analysts that \\\"we may have been a little too optimistic in our forecasts and expectations for growth based on a rapid increase in the volume of connected vehicles.\\\" In the meantime, it seems that the connection between Otonomo\u2019s connected car and reality has been lost, and in the second quarter it recorded revenues of only $1.9 million. Although this is apparently a sharp jump compared to revenues of only $281,000 in the corresponding quarter, the growth came with two companies that Otonomo bought for generous sums since the IPO. The acquisitions also inflated the workforce, which amounted to 128 employees at the end of 2021. The first company acquired was the Israeli startup Neura, for which $50 million was paid in shares and cash, and the second was Floow, which was purchased for $69 million - half in an immediate payment of cash and shares and half subject to meeting targets. The two acquired companies together employed about 60 people. The purchase of Floow, which operates in the insurance sector, is the main contributor to Otonomo's revenues today, since last year it had revenues of approximately $7 million - that is, significantly more than Otonomo itself. Although in the first quarter they were consolidated only for part of the period and not a full quarter, it is easy to see that at least a million dollars should have come from Floow. Neura, whose solution is supposed to enable the extraction of insights from the information collected through Otonomo's platform, is a younger company, but at the time of the acquisition it was said that it too already had revenues of a few million dollars a year. Beyond the great distance between the performance and forecasts, another surprise awaited Otonomo investors in the form of a write-off of $45 million. This write-off was mainly due to the decrease in the value of Otonomo itself, but also included the write-off of in the value of the acquired companies which seem very expensive in light of Otonomo's current value. The write-off sent Otonomo to an operating loss of $65 million, which certainly will not please the company's largest shareholders - the Saudi investment fund MITACH, which recently reported that it had reached a 20% stake in Otonomo. It seems that at this stage it is better for both Otonomo\u2019s management and its shareholders to return the company to private ownership, put it in order after the two acquisitions, and hold off on an IPO for a more reasonable time - without SPAC shortcuts and after it begins to show clearer signs of the realization of its vision."

The much-maligned offensive cyber company will be parting ways with around 15% of its workforce, while long-standing CEO Hulio will focus on the sale of the company, which has been under intense scrutiny since last year for the sale of its Pegasus hacking tool Offensive cyber company NSO is laying off 100 of its 700 employees, Calcalist has learned. In addition, co-founder and CEO Shalev Hulio will be stepping down from his role and will be replaced by current COO Yaron Shohat. Hulio will remain in the company and be in charge of mergers and acquisitions. As part of this new role, Hulio will be responsible for helping the company find a new owner. As the new CEO, Shohat is in charge of implementing the company\u2019s reorganization process, including the layoffs. NSO has been under especially intense scrutiny since last year. Apple filed a lawsuit against NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for alleged surveillance and targeting of the U.S. in November of last year. Apple was the latest in a string of companies and governments to come after NSO, the maker of the Pegasus hacking tool that watchdog groups say targeted human rights workers and journalists. Earlier that month, U.S. officials placed the company on a trade blacklist. NSO has also faced either legal action or criticism from Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Cisco. NSO is allegedly involved in circumventing security for products made by these companies and selling that circumvention in the form of hacking tools to foreign governments. NSO told Calcalist: \u201cThe company will be implementing a cutback and reorganization program in order to adjust itself to the challenges ahead. As part of this, 100 employees will be laid off, and Shalev Hulio will step down from his role as CEO to continue and focus on mergers and the sale of the company. Yaron Shohat, who has filled several executive roles at the company over the past four years, will lead the company and its cutback and reorganization process.\u201d Sources close to the company told Calcalist that the Ministry of Defense\u2019s decision to reduce the number of licenses for the sale of offensive cyber tools has already led some companies to bankruptcy and that others will also go bust should this policy not change. Despite recent rumors that NSO is on the verge of bankruptcy, Calcalist has learned that it will end 2022 with revenue of around $150 million. Earlier this month, an inspection team headed by Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari published a report verifying the core findings revealed by Calcalist earlier this year in regard to the police's use of spyware and offensive cyber tools developed by NSO and other companies against citizens."

This will be the second significant cost cut by the company since it announced its intention to reduce expenses earlier this year, with Wix parting with several dozen employees when it closed its subsidiary Wix Answers in June Israeli-founded website building company Wix.com is laying off 100 employees, most of whom are based abroad. The company, which employs around 6,000 people, will publish its results for the second quarter of the year on Wednesday. Wix didn\u2019t respond to the report. This will be the second significant cost cut by the company since it announced its intention to reduce expenses earlier this year. In June, the company laid off several dozen employees when it closed its subsidiary Wix Answers. Wix, which has built a platform for setting up websites and online stores, surprised investors when it first talked about focusing on the spending side and setting profitability targets when it announced its result for the first quarter of 2022. \\\"Volatility and uncertainty remain at high levels and this creates a difficult environment for revenue growth. We are focused on strict cost management that will lead to operational efficiency, and we are already beginning to see results in the field,\\\" Lior Shemesh, CFO of Wix, was quoted as saying in the company\u2019s first-quarter financial reports. At that stage, the company was not ready to specify what exactly the plan will include, but Nir Zohar, President of Wix, insisted in a conversation with Calcalist that a round of layoffs was not planned, but rather more minor cuts and especially a reduction in investment in marketing. \\\"Since the beginning of the year, the world has experienced an economic crisis and we have seen U.S. GDP fall without growth,\\\" says Zohar. \\\"It affects our business because the internet is not growing and we can not remain indifferent to it in the short term, even if we are confident that the long-term trends will continue. If there is less traffic on the internet, Wix will spend less on marketing. At a time like this, we want to be more calculated. We will increase the number of employees in the coming year, but it will be in the tens or hundreds. Of course, we will not double the workforce as we have done in the last three years.\u201d The Q1 results published by Wix revealed a not particularly encouraging picture of significant slowdown in growth, along with huge losses. These reports came after the fiasco of the annual reports for 2021, in which Wix did not provide an annual forecast for 2022 and attributed this to a high level of uncertainty. In the meantime, however, the macroeconomic environment has only become more complex, and although this time the company is making a forward forecast, it is talking about a growth rate that is significantly lower than what it has accustomed investors to. The company predicted annual growth of 10-13% in revenue, but warned that this is \\\"provided that no further deterioration is seen in the macro environment.\u201d Alongside the growth rate that slowed dramatically after the pandemic period, the heavy losses that Wix is still recording are particularly noticeable. In the first quarter, it lost $227.3 million or $3.95 per share, with the loss including $116 million that stems largely from the fall in monday.com shares, which Wix holds. But even after deducting such losses, Wix posted a loss of $41.4 million in the first quarter and burned $33.6 million."

Vee\u2019s platform hosts a wide range of volunteering opportunities, enabling HR teams to find, coordinate, and share charity events Israeli startup Vee, which is developing a volunteering platform, is laying off 16 of its 50 employees, making up around 30% of its workforce. Vee raised $12 million in a Seed round less than six months ago led by State of Mind Ventures, with participation from noted Israeli VCs Oryzn Capital, Vertex, Viola Ventures, and well-known angel investors including Eynat Guez of Papaya Global, Amir Shevat of Innovation Endeavors, Gil Hirsch of StreamElements, and Guy Shamir of Mivtach Shamir. \u201cAs some of you already heard, we decided to let go of 30% of our employees,\u201d CEO May Piamenta wrote in a LinkedIn post on Sunday. \u201cWe made this decision with an extremely heavy heart, knowing we are committed firstly to Vee, to our investors, and to all the people around the world who get help from our platform. \u201cBefore blaming the market or anyone else, I want to take full responsibility for this incredibly unfair, hard moment for our team. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you are hiring you will all benefit greatly from working with those talented, mission-driven individuals,\u201d concluded Piamenta. Founded in 2020 by 23-year-old entrepreneur May Piamenta (CEO), Gil Amsalem (CTO), and Avi Amor (COO), Vee has raised a total of $13.5 million to date. Its platform hosts a wide range of volunteering opportunities such as food aid, animal welfare, youth mentoring, and environmental initiatives, enabling HR teams to easily find, coordinate, and share charity events and in effect build a community for giving back inside the company. \u201cI set up my first business in eighth grade, purchasing swimwear and then selling it on. I sent out deliveries throughout the entire country, with the operation being run out of my home in Dimona,\u201d Piamenta told Calcalist in February of this year. \u201cI sold the company at the end of eighth grade and joined a robotics program. I realized that I connect with the entrepreneurial part of the group and that led me to raise funds for the program. During this program, I encountered many non-profit organizations that require help and many companies that want to help but don\u2019t know how. Towards the end of my IDF service, I understood that I wanted my next business to tackle this challenge, but I didn\u2019t have enough money to start. So instead I set up a company that helped build websites for people and companies within 24 hours. After six months we managed to raise funds for the new company so I brought in my cousin Gil Amsalem and we recruited our third partner Avi, as well as a development team that volunteered to work on the project.\u201d Vee has over 500 companies and organizations on its platform, among them eBay, Booking.com, Salesforce, and Columbia University. The platform is active in 10 different countries and logs in hundreds of new activities per week."

Soluto was acquired by the U.S. company in 2013, but will be closing as part of a reorganization being taken on by Asurion Soluto, the Israeli R&D center of U.S. company Asurion, is shutting down. All 120 employees of Soluto were notified on Sunday of Asurion\u2019s decision. The move was made as part of an internal reorganization at Asurion which includes downsizing its global workforce and changing its business focus and growth targets. Asurion will also be parting ways with hundreds of employees from its U.S. offices. Asurion said that it made the difficult decision to close its Israeli site as a result of the cuts being made across the company and after choosing to focus its current growth on the cellular market. \u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t allow us to continue and employ the talented employees at Soluto and to continue and develop the innovative technologies at the Tel Aviv site,\u201d the company said. The company added that Soluto\u2019s 120 employees will receive extended benefits in order to provide them with a safety net for the coming months. All employees will receive guidance and support from a professional team set up by the company\u2019s HR department in order to help them find a new job. Around 40 people will continue to be employed at the company until the end of the year. \u201cThe decision to close the offices in Tel Aviv and part ways with the team that contributed to our company\u2019s success over many years is not easy,\u201d said John Leonard, Senior Vice President, Global Product Management, at Asurion. \u201cThe team at Soluto had an important part in our growth and success since the company was acquired in 2013.\u201d Soluto CEO Merav Oren, who was appointed to the role last June, said: \u201cWe are very sad to announce that today we had to notify all of our team members at Soluto of Asurion\u2019s decision to shut down the Israeli development center. These are people who believe in the company and the product and gave their heart and capabilities every day in order to create the best possible product for our users. We brought in the best professionals in their fields to Soluto over the years, creating a leading force in Israeli tech and maintaining a unique culture. For me personally, this is a very difficult moment. We are committed to making every effort to support and help each and every one of the employees to find an excellent workplace that will benefit from their capabilities and skills.\u201d Tomer Dvir, co-founder of Soluto and SVP at Asurion, said: \u201cI was very saddened by the decision. We set up a professional team with a unique culture that over 14 years created, and influenced the local community, Asurion, and millions of customers across the world. Despite the pain, I know that the team members will take with them the unique talent, culture, and attitude to the lucky companies which they will join next.\u201d Soluto was founded in 2008 by Dvir and Ishay Green to provide a digital protection and support service that integrates an app, web portal, and support technicians. It raised a total of $18 million before being acquired by Asurion in 2013 for $130 million, marking its entrance to the Israeli operations market."

The Israeli startup, which provides community insights and an analytics platform for state and local governments, will be parting ways with around 30 employees Zencity, a community insights and analytics platform for state and local governments, has laid off 30 employees, making up around 20% of its total workforce. Around 20 of the employees were based in Israel, with the rest being located in the company\u2019s offices in North America. Zencity has raised over $50 million to date, including $30 million last June from TLV Partners, Vertex Ventures Israel, Salesforce Ventures, M12 - Microsoft\u2019s venture fund, and Canaan Partners Israel. The company has grown rapidly over the past year, including completing two acquisitions of companies in the U.S. and Canada.

The company makes use of artificial intelligence to analyze data aggregated from resident-generated data from sources including social media, mobile applications, and city hotlines and create actionable insights for mayors, municipal department heads, and other decision-makers. The company serves around 300 clients, including four of the five biggest cities in the U.S., as well as the Israeli municipalities of Tel Aviv, Beer Sheba, Ramat Gan, and Netanya. \u201cWe are conducting an organizational change and are parting ways with truly excellent people,\u201d said Feder-Levy. \u201cThis is very painful on a human level, but it is the responsible thing to do for the betterment of our clients and mission. We have built something extraordinary at Zencity over the past five years. We are a company that is growing rapidly and have also scaled significantly, and are effecting on a daily basis hundreds of cities across the world while increasing the trust between local municipalities and the residents they serve. Over the recent period our workforce has grown considerably under certain market assumptions that we took. The situation in the markets has changed and that requires us to act accordingly and I take responsibility for that. However, we need to remain first and foremost committed to our clients and to the residents they serve. Despite parting ways, our commitment to the employees continues to be deep and we will do everything we can to help them move to their next role easily and safely. I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone for their great contribution to our success and to the local municipalities we support.\u201d The company noted that the organizational change will affect every part of the company, including management, and that it will set the company up for continued growth and global expansion after recently adding clients in the UK, Australia, and additional countries."

The Israeli company will be parting ways with 30 employees eight months after raising $205 million at a $1.5 billion valuation Israeli unicorn Lusha is laying off 30 employees, 10% of its total workforce, across all departments. Lusha raised $205 million at a $1.5 billion valuation eight months ago, with a significant part of the round going towards secondary deals. The Series B last November came on the back of a $40 million Series A in February which followed five years of being bootstrapped. Lusha was founded in 2016 by Assaf Eisenstein and Yoni Tserruya. In May of this year, Plus Ventures, headed by veteran entrepreneur Yossi Moldawsky, and private investor Oren Abekasis, filed a lawsuit with the Tel Aviv District Court claiming that they invested in the previous reincarnation of Lusha, when the company was named Neta Eisenstein Management (2008) and that the founders of Lusha stole the company from its investors. Lusha\u2019s cloud-based platform facilitates salespeople sharing contact information and company insights, which validates Lusha\u2019s data and ensures high accuracy. The company's community approach also ensures that salespeople from organizations of all sizes have access to the data they need to optimize their sales outreach. \u201cLusha has grown rapidly in revenue and manpower over the past year. Nevertheless, due to the situation in the markets and the economic slowdown, we have made a difficult decision to take responsible steps that will ensure the continued success of Lusha over time and provide control over cash flow,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs part of the reorganization for the new situation, we will focus the company on the data sector and other strategic projects, while stopping over projects and becoming more efficient in our marketing and sales expenses in order to continue and grow. As a result, we are sadly forced to part ways with talented employees who we\u2019ll provide with an expanded departure package and support in finding a new job in order to ensure a soft as possible landing.\u201d"

The company will be parting ways with 120 out of its 400 employees, including around 35 in Israel. Bizzabo said it made the decision due to the uncertainty in the market and as preparation for an extended downturn in business. Bizzabo has made several acquisitions over the past couple of years, growing its staff and product offering substantially. The company acquired Montreal-based event tech startup Kilk last November in what was its fourth acquisition in six months, an addition complementing its previous acquisitions of x.ai, Whalebone, and TeeVid. Bizzabo has set up an HR team that will assist the departing employees and will also provide increased compensation packages.

The trading platform is currently in advanced negotiations for a private funding round for between $800 million and $1 billion, at a $5 billion valuation Trading platform eToro is laying off 100 employees, half of them in Israel. This number represents around 6% of the company\u2019s total workforce. At the same time as announcing the cuts, eToro also officially announced that it mutually agreed with the Betsy Cohen-backed blank-check company FinTech Acquisition Corp to terminate their SPAC merger deal more than a year after it was announced. The companies announced back in March of 2021 that they had agreed to merge at a company valuation of $10.3 billion. However, the deal was bogged down by a protracted prospectus and regulatory process. FinTech Acquisition Corp V then announced in January that the fintech company\u2019s valuation has been cut by over 15% to $8.8 billion. In addition, the size of the funding it was set to receive fell from $650 million to $443 million, meaning it became even clearer that eToro would be better off raising funds privately, even at the expense of shareholders being diluted, rather than going public. As a result, eToro is currently in advanced negotiations for a private funding round for between $800 million and $1 billion, at a $5 billion valuation. The failure to complete the merger wasn\u2019t just due to the dramatic drop in the valuations of tech companies, but was also the result of regulatory changes in regard to SPACs and companies involved in cryptocurrencies, which accounted for a large portion of eToro\u2019s growth over recent years. \u201cDue to the current market conditions and after a period of accelerated growth we decided to take in the current period a more balanced approach between growth and profitability,\u201d said eToro CEO and co-founder Yoni Assia. \u201cAs a result, we made a difficult decision to cut our workforce in order to ensure long-term sustainable growth.\u201d"

Verbit joins a growing list of unicorns to layoff employees over recent weeks, including eToro, Lightricks, Cybereason, OpenWeb, and Trax. Verbit also notified its employees that it will be restructuring the company into business divisions after reaching an ARR of $100 million. This structure will allow it to reduce redundant positions created due to the company\u2019s acquisitions and put it in a position to continue its growth with additional acquisitions. Verbit, which also raised $157 million in a Series C last May, has developed an AI platform that offers advanced technologies and full integrations into video-focused platforms. \u201cWe have experienced a period of hypergrowth, increasing our workforce fivefold over a period of 18 months during which we acquired six companies,\u201d Livne wrote in a letter to the company\u2019s employees. \u201cOur success, which includes the doubling of our client base, including strategic clients in the different industries we serve, was achieved in different market conditions, and now we need to navigate the company and ensure that we are in the best position to lead it to prosperity and continued success, while we balance between growth and profitability.\u201d In order to help the company in its organizational change, Alon Klomek, the former Chief Business Officer at Cellebrite, has been brought in as a VP. \u201cIt is always sad to part ways with significant partners in our journey and I want to thank each and every one of the Verbit employees that took part in this journey and made the company a world leader in its sector. Myself and the rest of the Verbit management are personally committed to helping each and every one find the next destination in their career.\u201d Verbit, which was founded in 2017 and has offices in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Israel, will employ a total of 520 employees following the cutback, 50 more than it had when it announced its latest funding round."

These options include pursuing strategic transactions as well as a restructuring of our liabilities, among other avenues. These exhaustive explorations are complex and take time, but we want the community to know that our teams are working with experts from many different disciplines. Our relationship with the community and our clients has been a source of pride for all team members at Celsius, and we will continue to share information with our customers as and when it becomes appropriate.\u201d Celsius was co-founded in 2017 by Israeli Daniel Leon, President and COO of Celsius, CEO Alex Mashinsky, and CTO Nuke Goldstein.
